I managed to solve all the tasks for registering and servicing a company in the eurozone even though at the time all the Ukrainian citizens were under strict control. The company was hit hard by the coronavirus and the subsequent pandemic, but I managed to cut the budget and keep the size of the team that allowed the company to go further with fundraising and acquiring new clients.
Briefly, for the past 2 years was working with Visa and Mastercard tokenization, managed to expand my knowledge in cryptography was managing a team up to 11 people defining priorities and managing planning ( though I believe that the number is much less important if the processes are built right).
2 years before, I've been leading a high-load project using AWS-based serverless architecture. Node.js Vue.js React.js React native.js was used to create the final product. As a part of this project, I was involved in all organizational activities, from managing a team (up to 6 people) and building a product, to registering a company in the eurozone, coordinating the opening of accounts, agreeing Privacy Policy and other documents with lawyers, searching for clients, etc. Of course, Agile methodology was used in this context. We built a product that has B2B and B2C sides, brought it beyond the breakeven point. Worked with MAU,ARPU,CAC,Churn/Conversion and retention rates.

I am passionate about empowering my team to produce their best work and I achieve that by applying excellent communication skills, being a servant leader, and always focusing on finding solutions to any challenges on the way.

product manager,"I am proud of making the right decisions, that actually defined my career path. The first one is when I chose the concentration - IT Management at university, this step gave me chance to learn every important subject for the IT sphere and refined my vision about the business world. The second important decision was when I took participation in the exchange program WAT USA and worked in the admissions team in Cedar Point for 3 months.  On the one hand, this experience showed me the importance of B2C, and on the other hand, refined my soft skills like communication, teamwork, decision-making, etc.  These decisions were followed by other important steps that actually created my journey in the IT field.
I am a Business Administration/IT Management undergraduate student at Free University of Tbilisi. My first IT role was as Quality Assurance Manager in the Agile team at GPI Holding which occupies one of the leading positions in the insurance market of Georgia. My team used to work on CRM products that provide software tailored to the sales team. My main role was manual testing (finding bugs and report them to the dev team, ensure that software meets requirements), as well as active participation in Grooming and Planning and leading the Sprint Review as well - showcase the work done during the sprint and inspect the roadmap of the product.
 After 10 months of the very interesting working process, I decided that I needed more challenges to overcome and perfect myself in the product development path. So I took my next step and became Assistant IT Project Manager at APP3null GmbH. This company operates in the app development market in Europe.
 I was responsible for delivering the project on time, within the scope and the budget. My activities included but were not limited to: communicate with clients and stakeholders, take participation in defining the project scope, gather requirements, set up the team, define and describe the main specifications of the product, create a full backlog, manage meetings and relevant documents. My team successfully released the educational application under my leadership. The app’s purpose is to prepare law students for exams, it consists of explanations and different types of quizzes. 
Above mentioned experiences played a very important role to refine my vision in the product development field, showed my strengths and skills that helped me to find my passion in IT management. I am obsessed with being part of a team that creates amazing products which solve end users’ problems and generate preferences for them. I am looking for the opportunity to join out of the box thinking team, lead and manage processes to deliver great projects.

I am a highly motivated professional with experience in account management, sales, and project management. My most recent role was as a Middle Account Manager at IT company that provides electronic document management services. I was part of the team responsible for working with retail clients, where my main duties included analyzing existing business processes, consulting on automation solutions, coordinating complex implementations, budgeting, and sales planning. I also conducted extensive analytics using QLIK.
Some of my personal achievements include increasing client turnover by 27% on a quarterly basis, achieving the highest volume of additional sales for the department for four consecutive months. 
Also, I was the Head of Sales Department at design studio, where I led the sales and design teams and was responsible for developing marketing strategies, hiring and managing up to ten employees, meeting with key clients, and negotiating contracts. During my tenure, I reduced expenses by 1.5 times and increased monthly revenue by 350%.
Before my role at Head of Sales, I was a Project Manager, where I handled customer inquiries, negotiated contracts, and managed projects from start to finish. I also developed a new format for commercial proposals and created scripts to streamline lead processing.

I am now seeking a Junior Product Manager position where I can apply my analytical and organizational skills to develop and implement successful product strategies.

My consulting work with small businesses and startups from tech and non-tech domains has allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills, and I am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges that will help me grow as a professional.
Hello, I'm Ruslan, a Product Management consultant with over 15 years of hands-on experience in IT, including more than 10 years in the field. I've spent 7 years in leadership/management positions in various companies, from large enterprises to small startups. I have practical experience launching my own businesses and products, which has given me the following skills:

- Critical thinking
- Data-driven and data-informed approach, avoiding gut feelings and guessing

Based on your experience in product management, I can help you with tasks such as product strategy, roadmapping, feature prioritization, and product launches. Additionally, I can assist with team building and coaching, as well as identifying and capitalizing on business opportunities.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
As I think about my future organization, there are a few key aspects that are particularly important to me. One of the most significant is trust. I want to feel that the leadership team trusts me to make decisions and take ownership of my work, whether that work is related to product development or team management. I believe that trust is a key component of a healthy and productive work environment, and that it can help to foster a sense of independence and creativity among employees.

Another important aspect of my ideal organization is delegated autonomy. I don't want to feel micromanaged or overly restricted in my work, particularly when it comes to decision-making. I want to have the freedom to explore new ideas and approaches, and to take calculated risks when appropriate. I believe that this kind of autonomy can be empowering and can help to drive innovation and growth.

In terms of the kinds of projects that I want to work on, I am particularly interested in those that involve IoT, hardware, and software. I believe that these technologies have enormous potential to change the way that we interact with the world around us, and I am excited about the prospect of being involved in projects that push the boundaries of what is possible. I want to focus on getting practical experience in these areas so that I can develop my skills and knowledge and become a more valuable contributor to my organization.

Ultimately, if you were to ask me whether I want to change the world, my answer would be a resounding yes! I believe that we all have the potential to make a difference in the world, and I am eager to be a part of an organization that shares this vision and is committed to making a positive impact."

Hi,

I'm Leo, Product Manager. What am I proud of:

- Launched 2 startups and sold one of them.
- While working as a Product Manager I increased key metrics within 5 months: Net revenue - 11%, Retention rate - 9%, LTV - 10.5%.
- While working on my 2nd startup I acquired 154 users (from USA and Russia) for closed MVP testing within 2 weeks and with CAC = 0. It was enough for the first soft launch.
- Made 1 B2B sale before MVP ready to test the demand.

What am I not proud of but what became lessons for me:

- While launching the first startup, I tried to find a problem with the technological solution. It was the first experience that thought me how it should be done. However, we sold this startup at the end.
- I got caught in a financial venture one time and lose 10% of my savings. This experience taught me to make financial decisions more cleverly.

Will be glad to hear you! :)
I'm open to any opportunities. Would like to know about company and its product more before give the exact answer :)"

I organized the company's simultaneous transition to a new online store and a new trade management system (which needed to be prepared for the transition from 0).

− the website and the trade management system began to work more stable, the number of calls to the technical support chat decreased by ~40 times;
− synchronization of the site with stock balances and prices began to take place 13 times more often, due to which the number of irrelevant orders decreased and the load on the sales department decreased;
− the company had the opportunity to develop an e-shop and automate the company's processes (which I did later).

I am a product manager who has invested in my knowledge of money and time. My experience entails analyzing my mistakes in personal business and staying updated on modern trends for creating successful products. With my background in personal projects, I am able to efficiently and swiftly implement ideas at a low cost, as well as revive existing products that have not met their targets and guide them to the forefront.

My main focus is on achieving results rather than getting caught up in the process, which justifies my effectiveness. My motivation lies in creating a product that will propel the company to become a global leader in its segment.

product manager,"Most recently, Fred implemented a gamification strategy into a digital banking app called Bloomm, which is currently in public beta with 250,000 users. On the Bloomm app, Fred developed a Save2Win feature which issues a jackpot ticket to users whenever they save for a chance to win daily cash prizes. 80% of the users highlighted this feature as the most retentive feature on the app. The app was also complemented for it's unique user experience & interface simplicity.
*About Me*
Hello, my name is Fredrick Adams, 
I am a skilled & well-versed Product Manager with 6 years experience in designing, developing, & delivering technology products.
In the past 4 years, I was Co-founder & Chief Product Officer at a Fintech Startup based In Lagos, Nigeria. 
As Chief Product Officer, I managed a cross functional team of designers, product managers, & developers.

My most recent product release is a digital banking app called Bloomm, which is currently in public beta with 250,000 users.
On the Bloomm app, I developed a Save2Win feature which issues a ticket to users whenever they save for a chance to win daily cash prizes.
80% of the users highlighted this feature as the most retentive feature on the app. 

I utilise a customised product development framework ( Product Vision > Product Strategy > Product Discovery > Product Delivery > Product Success ) to align business requirements with user needs.
My strengths include outlining unique business models, developing product strategy and building out relevant KPI metrics to measure product success. I am also able to build product features in relation to user needs, leverage RICE/MOSCOW frameworks to prioritise product features, scope product MVP from prioritised backlogs, draft a goal driven product roadamp, build GTM plans & engage Scrum Teams on product delivery using Agile processes, while managing product P&L statements.

*How I work*
Fred leverages his customised product development framework ( Product Vision > Product Strategy > Product Discovery > Product Delivery > Product Success ) to align business requirements with user needs. Fred defined the product strategy ( PMF Strategy) and outlined the extensive features for the application and he listed the KPI's to be tracked for product success.

He was able to interview customers & utilised their feedback to create a customer journey map which allowed him identify the user pain points and find the intersection between the users pain points and the features he developed. He further iterated on some features based on the users feedback.

Next, Fred prioritised the product features using the MOSCOW Prioritisation Framework, and he was able to map out the MVP Release & subsequent feature releases. For each release, Fredrick used the User Story Mapping Framework & drafted the user stories, acceptance criteria, acceptance tests, & business value assumptions.

product manager,"
Actively looking for a product, brand, and/or business to develop and grow with! 
I have two years of experience working for small start-up companies, actively participating, or even leading the business growth. I have strong strategic planning skills, analytical skills, and a proactive mindset. 

I have come to my current wide range of skills from a solid background in architecture and design, in which I have 4+ years of experience. The technical side of architecture has taught me to think systematically and to solve problems in a consistent and sustainable way. Interaction with clients has taught me to approach the development of a product in a way that would satisfy their needs and sparked my interest in UX design methodologies. 

Being interested in project/product management and brand/product marketing from the very start of employment just after university, along with the experience mentioned, gives me a range of skills and knowledge to approach a multi-faceted nature of a product and/or brand development. 

Working for start-up companies has broadened my experience of executing tasks within a given framework to being proactive and setting up goals and tasks for myself and for the team, and analytically overlooking the outcomes in terms of affecting product/business growth.

As an experienced product manager, I have a strong background in marketing and a proven track record in delivering excellent customer experiences. With a diverse range of skills and expertise, I have successfully managed projects in both the telecommunications and gambling industries.

During my 3.5 years in the CRM department at a telecom company, I held two key roles. Initially, I worked as a data analyst, where I conducted in-depth product and business metrics analysis. 

After gaining valuable experience as a data analyst, I transitioned into the role of a marketing manager. In this capacity, I focused firstly on customer retention and after on engagement strategies. I developed and managed sales funnels to optimize the customer journey and increase customer loyalty. Additionally, I conduct BRD’s to shared developmnet team and implemented A/B testing to continually refine and improve marketing campaigns. 

As a product manager in the gambling industry, my primary objective was to enhance the navigation experience for users on various web and native platforms across different regions. By making it easier for players to find what they were searching for, we aimed to improve user retention and increase average core activity per user. To achieve this, I conducted extensive user research to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. This research involved a combination of customer interviews, surveys, and user behavior analysis using tools like Google Analytics.

One of my notable contributions as a product manager was the creation and testing of product hypotheses. Leveraging my analytical and market research skills, I developed hypotheses based on customer needs and industry trends. These hypotheses were then validated through A/B testing, allowing us to iterate and optimize our product offerings. Additionally, I took the initiative to build product funnels, mapping out the user journey and identifying opportunities to enhance conversion rates and average active days.

In my previous roles, I have successfully contributed to various areas of business analysis, financial analysis, and collaborative stakeholder engagement, specifically focusing on the creation of innovative platforms.

product manager,"- Created and successfully implemented two business strategies
- Created a lot of business processes
- Designed and managed development of the banking system worth $100k+
- Designed and managed development of cards functionality in bank's mobile application
Currently I'm in a product manager role (head of card business in a bank) but not that “managing only” kind, I rather do a lot of work directly by myself because of the small organization size.

For the past 14y I’ve successfully managed a lot of programs and projects with budgets from a couple of hundreds to hundreds of thousands US dollars.

Variety of project types includes banking products and services development, API integrations, business processes development and improvements, software features implementation (including mobile application), marketing campaigns, processes outsourcing and in-housing, systems adoption and many more.

During these projects I’ve managed cross-functional teams either housed or outsourced and, besides project management, often had hands-on roles like product owner, business analyst, tester, etc.

In my management work, I prefer a data-driven approach for decision making and things to be well-organized but with reasonable effort at the same time. I’m trying to be a supportive leader to my team with a high level of emotional connection and mediate possible conflicting situations if they arise.
Due to the high level of conservatism in banking sector, projects were managed mostly using the Waterfall model but I’m eager to work with Agile frameworks in favor of what I’m putting a lot of effort into learning the theory.

As for my personal qualities I’m a self-organized and naturally curious person, never stopping to improve my skills and learn new things.

I’m quite passionate about creating things that never existed before, building and improving processes, investigating and developing solutions for issues, therefore currently my focus of interest lies more in the software development field.

In my free time I'm improving my project management knowledge base by reading and attending courses and also trying to develop my pet-project - front-desk application for bank staff, based on a MERN stack.

product manager,"
Dear recruiting team I am passionate about product management. I don't want this cover letter to be boring, so I would structure it by mentioning my 5 most vital skills.
 
1. I understand business and how it should work from the inside.
Most of the business skills I got while working at Laba. I successfully launched the Ukrainian-language Laba in 10 months: 10+ courses, one website, and two social networks. I was fully responsible for financial performance, products, the Ukrainian language version of the site, promotion, and product brand.

2. I developed good analytical skills while working in Accelerators, business schools, and EdTech companies. I was the first to introduce segmentation in analyzing funnels for Accelerator programs and management development programs at the Ukrainian Social Academy and create a CJX - map. I thus fixed the UX of the newly launched online learning platform, simplifying the client path and almost doubling the number of new users in the webinars section.

In addition, I actively worked with creative design, name tests, fake doors tests, and a/b landing tests while working in Laba. Thanks to this, I raised the CR higher than other Eurasian units by 20%.

3. I pumped prioritization skills while working on various projects with regional Accelerators and online Laba courses.

Thanks to the prioritization in the Laba company, I managed to run more than 13 successful course flows (the proportion was 13+ successful / 2 unsuccessful launches).

Working on accelerators for social business, within the time limits, I successfully ""closed"" two Accelerators in the regions, two series of funnel webinars (a total of about 20 webinars), and five consulting projects.

4. Communication skills. Most of these skills I improved while working on volunteer projects. During the most significant project (lasting about six months), I simultaneously led a team of 38 people. Thanks to communication and leadership, my team held about 25 charity events/camps for children, teaching them English, the basics of children's rights, and the fashion industry in two years.

5. If we talk about my most noticeable soft skill - it's lifelong learning. I can quickly immerse myself in a new field, boldly try new techniques and experiment, analyze, draw conclusions and thus grow.

I hope to have the ability to answer your questions and learn more about your Company.

product manager,"I have about 3 years of experience in software development, particularly as a front-end developer, however now I’m looking for a project management position.

product manager,"With the most recent product I was to kick off with a brand new team and almost immediately needed to launch a new big functionality from scratch, meaning we had to go through the whole path from understanding business perspectives, gathering the requirements, evaluating risks, etc. to design and development. In the meantime I was also to decide other bug fixes and improvements that we needed to squeeze into our backlog, so that both internal and external customers were happy with the outcomes, and the company is moving towards its business goals. In the meantime I had to cope with the onboarding process, people management and extreme lack of resources and data available.
The product that I worked previously was not the top priority one, still I managed to handle it's reorganization, movement to another platform, discovering new points of growth, so that the stagnating product started growing. I was involved on all stages, including close cooperation with datacenter operations, restocking, pricing strategy updates, SEO and PPC optimization, Marketing strategy update.
Have an experience of working in the established company (Namechep Inc., Hosting Product) and a startup (SanityDesk Inc., Marketing tool for small businesses). In-between worked as a business analyst to widen my skillset.
My duties and responsibilities were:
- understanding and monitoring and analysis of the market trends, drivers and competitors relative to where the Company is positioned; 
- continuous customer development, customer persona creation;
- leading a cross-functional team that included designer, engineers and data scientist;
- assisting in driving components of the product lifecycle from concept to phasing out of product(s);
- analysis of product pain points and improvements; 
- defining features through acceptance criteria and how features will behave as well as the business logic surrounding them; 
- development of documentation that supports the approval, design, development and launch of the product in tandem with stakeholders; 
- cooperation with a variety of internal stakeholders (UX, Design, Marketing, SEO, PPC, Technical and Customer support, Developers Team, other Product divisions), describing issues and product aspirations, elicitation and refining of requirements;  
- coordination of operational product activities/projects; 
- creation of different product-related reports

Being passionate about the result I deliver, I am always goal and detail oriented, have skills in customer relationship, product management, strong understanding of business analysis basics. I believe that any decision regardless of the task should be data-driven.

Since I was the connecting link between different departments including developers, designers, marketing specialists, technical support, I was to communicate the goals and ideas, to make them clear for all the stakeholders, validate the results and initiate following actions I developed strong soft skills such as communication, problem solving, adaptability, decision making.

Previously as a Product Manager I also was responsible for the hardware part to be ordered and utilized in time to minimize losses.

Hello! As it's anonymous, let me introduce myself with my work experience.

I started my career as a product designer and after student/freelance projects and a year of working in a product company, switched to a PM position, and it's already 4.5 years since I am enjoying this role in different products and teams. I co-founded several small startups/pet projects (unfortunately, they've never succeded to become full-time job) and worked in 2 big and famous Ukrainian product companies as well as 1 international fintech/crypto business, and my management experience so far is quite versatile:
– Launching products from scratch (native mobile apps, web apps, chatbots, offline experiences) in different roles (product designer, product owner, product manager), conducting user and market research, rapid prototyping and UX testing, managing roadmap and its' execution.
– Worked on large sustainable products, iteratively improving them with a focus on data analytics, experimenting and achieving results with key metrics, and digging for insights and growth opportunities.
– Transition from small experimental teams to dedicated business departments, helped product teams to grow and develop, adjusting product development processes and communication

Currently, I'm looking for a company with a strong product vision and value. Also, there must be a cultural fit with a team, as I value trust, ownership, and acceptance of failures.

I want to challenge myself to work in a more global and diverse environment on something less utilitarian than my previous domains (transport, real estate, fintech). Entertainment, Media, Education or Gaming (no gambling) are my top priorities.
– Trusting and open-minded environment, which values learning, experiments, and feedback
– Professional management and stakeholders with clear goals and strategy
– Team where everyone feels responsibility and ownership for what they do, the team which really cares about the company and product. Working as a member in it, helping to achieve success, not just giving tasks and reviewing results.
– Product with clear value to its' real-world users (not something with very narrow and specific audience)"

product manager,"What was my first job after the outbreak of war in Ukraine?

Through the Ukrainian Association of Chefs, I began to actively participate in helping people who were affected by the war and were severely limited in food and nutrition.

In addition, we collected clothes, personal hygiene products, food and hygiene products for children.
Hey guys!

I have no experience in IT at the moment.
But I do have quite extensive experience in product sourcing, business creation, team building and development, hypothesis testing, working with marketers, and product promotion.

All of these skills I acquired in the culinary field, so if your product is about food/cooking - maybe that would be the best application of my knowledge and skills. But that's not the only vector of my interests. For example, in the summer of 2022, I took a course on cryptocurrency and continue to improve my knowledge in this area daily.

After the beginning of the war in Ukraine, I was trained as a Product Manager at LABA online school. I am actively improving my knowledge of English and, at the moment, I'm passing the B2 (upper intermediate) level. 

What did I do before the war in Ukraine?

I have a higher economic education as a manager of organizations. 
In 2012, I founded the first culinary school in Ukraine, which became the largest in the country.
In 2014, I created a restaurant project, which I then sold as a franchise. 
In 2015 I created another restaurant project with partners from which I left later, selling my 33% to my own partners.
In 2017 I founded the first Ukrainian Association of Chefs and the first Ukrainian Association of Bartenders and Baristas.
As early as 2017, I founded the Culinary Cup of Ukraine ""Eastern Region"", which annually gathered participants chefs from all over Ukraine and nearby countries, and the judges of the competition were the top chefs of Ukraine and from other countries.

Throughout these years, we have consulted various restaurant projects and cooperated with various international companies, both as partners and as consultants:
Metro Cash&Carry.
Uniliver Food Solution
Ferrero Rocher
Bonduelle
Philips
Kenwood
etc.

During this time I was a judge of the International Restaurant Awards for 3 years, a judge of numerous culinary championships across Ukraine and a speaker at national restaurant forums with an audience of up to 2000 people.

product manager,"We have recently started a groundbreaking project for perimenopausal women. Women of 50 are the backbone of society, just at a time when the menopause hits. It hits some women very hard and they do not get the help they deserve. All the partners in this project are on a mission to validate their problem through data collection and sharing, and then provide them with a convenient, affordable solution. Women’s health needs can be poorly served within an overstretched NHS, and another partner mission is to provide affordable, convenient access to gynaecologists and GPs who share their view about the importance of women’s health. Together, our aim was to evaluate the benefits of collecting data to inform women’s choices on managing menopause symptoms, through a new app.

The study aims to show that individualised data collection and sharing with gynaecologists produces better outcomes. During the study we’ll provide Medopad’s remote monitoring solution, offering access to peri- and post-menopausal women living in the UK, to monitor and collect data about their symptoms and allow them to manage and track their treatment benefits objectively. This study will assess whether women between the ages of 45 and 65 find collecting detailed symptom and general health data – for their own use and to be shared with their gynaecology team – useful and empowering. Two hundred women will be recruited over a three month period. They will be offered a free consultation with a gynaecologist at the beginning of the study, and then monthly for three months. Each participant will download and use the Medopad App, which has been customised for data entry on a full range of menopausal symptoms. Women will be able to see the patterns of their menopause symptoms, monitor treatment, and share it with their gynaecologist. This will give an objective view of how treatment is working. And hopefully will empower women to take data-driven care of their health.
I am a citizen of the world: lived and worked in the UK, Hong Kong, Middle East, South Caucasus and Eastern Europe. Born in Ukraine to the General Manager of Fujifilm and an entrepreneurial mother, I have completed 4 degrees in economics, international business, human rights, and democratization. I published a book on diversity as a tool for empowering women towards cross-functional and STEM careers and created a decade-long career in product management and strategy with government institutions and startups – all while being a mentor, philanthropist, and public speaker.

In 2014, I have decided to put on hold a Ph.D. in Social Sciences at the University of Hong Kong. The reason? Because building a startup is simply much more fun... 

Before getting into the scaleups world, I started few and sold one successful company in edtech, and made a prominent name in the tech field around the world. 

At the beginning of 2015 I have invested in HealthyLovedOnes, agetech startups in Hong Kong and founded HealthTech Network, an initiative for health and wellbeing ecosystem that facilitates investments, collaboration and awareness about new technology, AR/VR, data science and AI.

My superpower is product management, helping teams outperform by organizing work in the right way and with the right processes. I have been Senior Business Analyst at CompareGlobalGroup in Hong Kong for two years (being the only person without Computer Science background, but learning Python and R). Why? Because I love challenges and data driven decisions. 

With more than 12 years of solid experience, today I am the Product Manager at Healthtech startup. Our mission is to create a world where people can live longer. We work with world-leading healthcare providers, pharmaceutical, insurance and technology companies, including Apple and Tencent, to build a connected digital health ecosystem.
Healthtech, Medtech, Edtech and othet tech for good worldwide.
My current job includes research, market analyses, product management, and strategy. In every project, I need to gain a deep understanding of customer pain points, insight and ensure that we meet all their needs in the most innovative way in the market. My daily routine includes identifying product-market fit, prototyping, and testing solutions – talking to multiple internal and external stakeholders in 3 different continents. Product validation and field testing are my favourite parts because after that we do a product launch where the rest of the world can see the difference between past and future, almost like a time machine. 

Key achievements: 
⇨ Managed products in the following areas: mobile application, hardware and software integrations, SaaS platform and cloud, API, SDK, business analytics and vertical products. 

⇨  Worked with KOLs, R&D, internal and external stakeholders to communicate on product plan and gather feedback. 

⇨ Go-to-market strategist that helped define the overall experience, in addition to product experience.
 
⇨ Developed a multi-release roadmap for third party developers platform, influenced by prototype iteration, design, user feedback, and market data. 

⇨ Defined software program requirements and coordinated collaborations with other internal teams as well as manage partner and developers relationships."

I did a detailed research of similar products in the market, created the requirements documentation and after client approval forwarded the requirements to the team.

After some time I was promoted to Scrum Master/ Project Associate position.

I use Jira/TFS as a main tool for reporting and documentation.

I have been fortunate enough to work on a range of exciting projects, both in the B2B and B2C spaces. One of my biggest accomplishments has been launching a Reporting Tool in over 4 different countries. This tool has enabled users to create custom reports and access transactional data to make better decisions. It was a challenging but rewarding project.
I have also had the opportunity to work on a Product for the Port Community System. This project involved designing and building a system that manages the entire process of goods movement and operations in a port. It was a highly complex project that required me to have a deep understanding of logistics and supply chain management. However, seeing the product successfully implemented was extremely satisfying.

In addition to these projects, I also launched a website called playscrabble. The goal of this website was to provide users with an online platform to play Scrabble in different modes and connect with other players from all over the world. This project required me to have a good understanding of web development and user experience design.

Throughout my career, I have worked in various roles, including Business Analyst and Product Manager. These roles have allowed me to be involved in the entire product lifecycle, from ideation to delivery. One of my key strengths is my ability to understand user needs and translate them into functional requirements. However, I am always looking to improve my skills, especially in areas such as project management and data analysis.

Also, I collaborated closely with our sales and marketing team to develop strategies for attracting new customers. As we were building our processes from the ground up, I gained experience in lead generation, email campaigns, advertising, and other customer acquisition methods.

I oversaw the launch of two products, each aimed at validating different hypotheses about our product's feature set. In the process, we successfully onboarded approximately 200 users.  Also, I participated in and completed two startup acceleration programs. And in 2022, we took home the top prize in the IT Arena Startup Competition.

In my work, I utilize the following tools:

- Notion (for note-taking, team collaboration management, and planning)
- Jira (for development planning)
- Figma (for designing mockups and prototypes)
- Miro (for mind mapping and idea development with the team)
- HubSpot (CRM system)
- Apollo (lead generation and email campaign automation)
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (lead generation on LinkedIn)
- Mixpanel and Hotjar (for product analytics)

Being a CEO of a startup is an advantage in itself, as it has provided me with a very comprehensive experience. I need to be at the center of all events, communicate with customers, understand their needs, be able to clearly set development goals, generate and implement new ideas, understand and track key product and financial metrics, and do a lot of other work that helps to perceive the product as a business ecosystem.
Currently, I am looking for opportunities to work with a more experienced team and products that are in the later stages of development with high user engagement. It would also be interesting to gain experience working with products in the B2C segment, although I am open to other options as well."

product manager,"
I'm a motivated and forward-thinking Product Manager & Operations Coordinator with 3+ years experience.
Eager to support entreprises development and team management with leadership and guidance over a wide range of product
development efforts.
I have managed a team of 8 members, enhanced product value by 35 % for our B2B customers.
Leaded with focus and empathy commercial operations between stakeholders and more than 25 key clients in over 22
countries with a rate of 15 % clients signed, 64 % in negotiation phase and 21 % in handshake phase. Among those clients:
Insurance companies, Brokers, Reinsurers, Rental and leasing companies, Mining companies.
"
product manager,"I have built a team of 50 people and opened almost 60 locations from scratch. We started as 3 dreamers and know our company enrolls several thousands of students a year.

I have piloted a first Scratch-only competition for kids in 2019 and it gathered more than 1000 participants from all over Ukraine.

When I was engaged in marketing department of a business school we have been twice awarded as a “Best business school in Ukraine”.

I devote a lot of time to learning – I mostly read articles and watch online courses, but as well I studied in a number of business schools across the world: Adizes Institute, USA; Richard Ivey School of Business, Canada; BS of National University of Singapore; EMLyon BS, China; MIM-Kiev (Pre-MBA program).
In 2017 I became a finalist of IT education Awards (IT education nomination). 
In 2018 I was a speaker at iForum conference (Education/Future/Innovations section).
I'm an accomplished, insightful and result-oriented specialist in Project & Marketing Management with experience in different industries (IT and business education, startups, FMCG).

I'm now a COO of an NGO that runs one of the largest projects in IT education in UA. I am its co-founder and have been developing it for 4 years already. It started with only 3 people and a big idea and today I'm managing a 50 people team across all Ukraine. I'm responsible for strategic and operations management, business processes development, budgeting and communications. 

Previously I was engaged as a Strategic Planning Director for international advertising agency and was responsible for developing marketing strategies for existing and new products/services, market and customer research.

As well, I have experience of working as a Product Marketing Manager in an edtech startup - me and my friends launched a fully operational LMS that attracted almost 10 000 monthly active users with minimal advertising budget (unfortunately, it didn't become successful).

Before that I was working in one of the leading UA business schools on a number of marketing and project management positions. 

Product management is a desirable and deliberate (not a desperate :) career move for me. My professional experience and interests lie in spheres of marketing and management, but working in non-tech industries doesn’t drive me anymore. Startups, IT products and tech always caught my attention and I’m an early adopter of different tech solutions. Moreover, I am familiar with a role of PdM, despite my previous positions had other names. Being a PdM is an art of balance between tech, business development and design. It’s about knowing your product, users, market and constantly making decisions that would make your product better and your customers and stakeholders happier. One literally becomes a mini-CEO which is both challenging and inspiring for me.
I'm open to new challenges and that what drives and motivates me. I'm looking forward to working on a meaningful project that can have a real impact on the industry."

I have been working on multiple projects in various domains as a Project manager and have experience managing small and big teams. 

Later I shifted to the Product Manager role, and I had an excellent opportunity to build a product from scratch. When we started, there were only 3 people on board (Owner, designer, and myself).

Given my background, I can tell that I have good communication skills and understand how to manage and coordinate both tech and non-tech teams. I'm great at managing product priorities and decision-making. Since I worked at the startup, I had to deal with almost all aspects of product management, and I know how to grow a product. The main downside is that I don't have experience working at enterprise-level companies.  

I never hide if I don't know something because I always know where to find the answers. My experience taught me that the right mindset and work attitude are far more important than hard skills.

Loyalty and Bonuses
and Site Builder (Constructor)

Main achievements:
- Formed product vision for both products from scratch,

- formed a roadmap based on research and assumptions based on existing data
In terms of products:
Loyalty and Bonuses
Task: increase First time activation (acquisition) useful actions per session (engagement) and average session duration / average sessions per month (retention)
Were implemented: Wheel of Fortune, system of daily/monthly/limited tasks, group bonuses, cyclical cashback, mass issuance of bonuses (bulk actions) in the work there are a number of features that should solve the problem in the above metrics

Sitebuilder
Problem:  

long and resource-intensive process of launching new clients,
long time to implement BAU requests
inability to flexibly change your project without a development team (lack of no code solution)

Achieved : 
the product was launched from scratch, from the stage of ideation to entering the market and launching with customers (production)
The speed of launching projects in relation to the old method (assembly) has increased many times
Before 2-4 months - now 1 week.
90% reduction in the involvement of the development team in work on live projects
All this made it possible to untie the hands of the sales department and increase the number of concluded contracts and released projects with the same staff of the team.

product manager,"Worked with great teams in cool products.
I’ve been doing this for the past 5 years now. I’m a classic example The core foundation of my skillset was acquired during my time at Vodafone. I was managing projects for the internal corporate software products. Facilitating, project-management and requirements management. I was handling the B2B product of Vodafone - self-care system for call-center automation. I began building B2C products after I left Vodafone - I worked in several digital agencies. During that period I delivered 10 different projects. From startup mobile apps to delivering products to companies like Unicef and Sberbank. Around that time I began really digging deep in product-management. To me that represented a huge leap, since I was now able to focus on a single product, improving it’s metrics, working on various aspects of the same thing with a cross-functional team. I joined an online food delivery platform, consisting of 5 products within a single ecosystem - so much for a challenge. I’ve been working at Foodout for little over 6 months gathering feature ideas, prioritizing the backlog, producing roadmaps, analyzing the product’s performance, launching new initiatives and gaining depth. After that i’ve created few solution mobile concepts using design-sprint methodology for booking, healthcare industries.  Now I’m working on Fishka mobile app loyalty system.

The most profound addition to my UX skills was provided by the rockstar interaction designers at Meat Agency. I was lucky enough to be managing the software products from idea to launch and beyond. Identifying the value proposition, listing the jobs-to-be-done, interviewing customers, creating personas, defining the journey maps, sketching wireframes in Balsamiq and defining user workflows in a fast-paced environment. Ukrpochta is one hell of an example. Obviously this served m e well beyond Meat Agency. In Foodout, had me working on the most loaded internal interface in it’s admin panel - call-center page. Literally the first week I joined. I guess, they knew something. Long story short, if one were to categorize product managers in two camps, I would definitely be in a design-oriented one.

product manager,"I recently finished working on a shipping container's insurance platform. I am proud of the product for several reasons. First of all, I was responsible for developing the product from the ground up. I had to conduct the initial product discovery as well as formulate a general vision for the development of the product. Then, as a project manager, I had to oversee its implementation. The platform that we built as a result is unique globally. It is the first platform of its kind and it allows for astounding improvements in business processes, bringing policy issuance down from 2 hours to 17 seconds.
I work at a LSE listed insurance company (TBC Insurance), where I manage strategically important projects.

During my tenure at Yelo Bank, my development plan toward debit card sales resulted in a significant increase by 50%, as well as a 10% increase in customer retention rate, and more than a twofold rise in card turnover. As part of this role, I conducted extensive analysis of customer needs, market trends, and potential partnerships from an ROI perspective, evaluating whether to build or buy solutions.

For more than ten years, I was a Project and Product Manager for an HVAC engineering company. In my role as a PM, I was responsible for technology selection, project planning, and team management. In the last five years, I have been involved in the development of products for the company.

I am currently considering a move into the IT industry. I believe that I have the skills, qualities, and experience that will allow me to enter the position of Product Manager and start bringing value to the company in the shortest terms.

At my previous place of work, I developed 3 (three) full-fledged, successful products from scratch. I owned the overall product development lifecycle - conducting competitor analyses and customer surveys, developing user stories, determining success indicators, defining a roadmap, and finally, contributing to delivering the product to the market.

I consider my strengths to be the ability to reveal and understand the essence of business needs and ""customer pain"". Also, I believe I can find a common language with different people."

My first manager job was at a startup called Searchanise back in 2014. It's a search engine for online stores. I've joined the project at its earliest stages, wrote marketing materials, manually worked on user feedback, and worked closely with the development team. I've led the project up to the point of it becoming certified Shopify partner.

Then, I switched to technical writing for several years and went back to management in 2017, for the presidential elections 2018 web portal. It was such an awesome project! I've worked with amazing team and we created a great product together.

In early 2018, I was hired by my current employer, a US-based service for bookkeepers and tax preparers. I started as the sole product manager and project manager. When I joined the company, we had no sales or product that was ready to sell. Now, we have multiple thousand customers on board and the team has grown four times. We now have six product managers, each responsible for a particular product area. My areas include document sharing, email, secure messaging, and reporting. As the most experienced product manager, I also collaborate with all the other managers helping them with their areas.
I have three points I look on when evaluating an employer, ordered by priority from the most important to the least important:

1. Processes. I'm looking for a company that has established, human-facing processes. Think Basecamp with their Shapeup doctrine, this is perfect for me.

2. Money. I'm looking for a company with good pay and transparent salary increase algorithms. As a family man, I'm responsible for the financial security of my family, thus competitive salary is very important for me.

3. Usefulness. Ideally, I'd like to work for a company that does healthcare, education, agriculture, or something similarly useful to the humankind. I really want to do something to be proud of."

product manager,"I used to work with a lack of information on the project, so I got the skill to gather all the required information and put that together. I can softly approach people, both customers and colleagues.  Also, I am very disciplined, which helps me organize my work.
My overall experience in Tech is nine years. I worked 
as Test Engineer, Test Lead, Error Manager, and Technical Product Manager. In addition, I have experience communicating with customers and helping them with the issues they report and the features they request.
"
product manager,"
My passion lies in building products that empower professionals and enhance their day-to-day activities. With a strong foundation in product management, I have successfully navigated various roles in the industry, honing my skills as a strategic thinker and innovative leader.

During my tenure as a Senior Product Manager at Ideals Board, I was entrusted with developing the product vision and strategy for iDeals Board. I led the transition to new product management processes, fostering a collaborative and efficient way of working. By implementing guidelines for hypothesis testing and data-driven product discovery, I enabled the development team to make informed decisions, resulting in successful product features. My dedication to mentorship and fostering a culture of continuous improvement strengthened the team's capabilities and overall productivity.

As a Product Manager at XCDS R&D hub, I spearheaded the launch of Collabio Spaces, a productivity tool based on innovative cloudless collaboration technology. My proficiency in market research and user interviews provided valuable insights for product feature development. Through data analysis, I devised strategies to enhance user retention, engagement, and monetization, further contributing to the product's success.

In my previous roles, including Lead Product Owner at XCDS International LTD and Product Owner at Quickoffice, I demonstrated my ability to define compelling product visions, create roadmaps, and lead successful product development cycles. 
My expertise in cross-functional collaboration, customer feedback processing, and strategic prioritization led to remarkable outcomes, including increased revenue and improved user experience.

My passion lies in leading projects that help solve real-world problems and empower the decision-making of individuals and civil society. 

Throughout my career in the Media domain, I have gained diverse experience in leading challenging projects with ambiguous parameters and many different types of stakeholders. I can remain organized in a fast-paced environment with many competing priorities and feel comfortable with having to pivot quickly when necessary.

Whether working alongside managers, engineers, designers, marketing, or newsroom teams, I am committed to nurturing a fun atmosphere and delivering the best solutions through collaboration and innovative thinking.

The detailed track record is complemented with a context in my CV.

product manager,"My greatest achievement is optimizing cost structure and increasing product profitability margin by 30% over a year. I led this project from hypothesis stage to full implementation, including user research (surveys, historical data analysis), requirements writing (preparation of epic description, work breakdown structure, design and engineering teams supervision), testing, set up of monitoring, etc. The project culminated in set-up of separate unit within my company (team of 10+ people with their own KPIs and processes) and to fundamental changes in operational activities in other units.

Another work that makes me proud is stabilizing a product with profound performance problems and poor-quality code base (5+ year product, developed by a team of 30+ throughout its history, with spaghetti code and old frameworks). Improved performance metrics from 1 to 110 concurrent users within 6 months.
Vast experience in product and delivery management, managing cross-functional teams of 20+ people, aligning stakeholder expectations, and leading end-to-end development of B2B and B2C applications.

I've worked with a variety of products:
- B2B products for Swedish and UK clients, and internal systems, incl. 5‑year product in adtech & media, fintech start‑up at discovery stage, internal tools for HR operations and overall projects portfolio reporting.
- B2C products (marketplace for content writing services, mobile app), selected modules in CRM system. 

My key expertise lies in:
1) Market research, competitor analysis. 
2) User research (in-depth interviews, analysis of data to formulate hypotheses and design experiments). 
3) Requirements elicitation and writing, backlog refinement, prioritization. 
4) Engineering teams supervision.
5) Business communication, stakeholders management. 

Apart from product management, I have experience setting up a department from scratch, including:
1) developing department goals and pitching the idea to top management of the company; 
2) composing the team;
3) setting team KPIs and individual targets, developing a bonus system.
The following domains are taboo: gaming, betting, gambling, essay writing, porn industry, dating.

4. Power to make decisions.
5. Nice and friendly atmosphere:-)"

-- Leading a multicultural team spanning two continents to develop an app to assess the size and nutrient needs of each member's farm and then provide a tailored farm inputs package to each member's need to optimize their return on investment and reduce waste. This led to an increase in the farmer membership subscribing to our service 2.5x
-- Developing an app to efficiently navigate the recent value chain disruptions and ensure the effectiveness of our decentralized distribution and collections system across various regions.

product manager,"
Currently, in the transition to Product Management, I would love to contribute to your company success by bringing a problem solving and can-do attitude to drive innovation, fuel revenue growth, enhance product positioning, expand market share, and achieve superior levels of customer satisfaction.
With a versatile background in Sales, Marketing and Category Management I have managed products and brands across the entire product cycle - starting from NPD, MVP and factory, though distribution and wholesale, to the end-user in retail and within several industries, including consumer electronics, toys, SAAS and even my own activewear line. After my second maternity leave, I realized that I’m willing to go back to technologies and that I might consider changing sales position to something else. It took me some time to understand that out of everything I’ve tried during my work life, I’ve been the best version of myself and enjoyed it the most when I had a chance to work with the product itself. 
So this year I’ve intentionally switched to product management. Have completed an intensive course on Customer Discovery by Berkeley HAAS Business School, several online courses on Product Management, learned a few new design tools, took an SQL course. This month I have also been enrolled into Harvard University course CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. I've got a hands-on agile experience with drawing prototypes and designing user flows, managing backlog, driving user interviews and writing use cases. I find a common language with developers and designers and I’m hungry for learning more!
I’m a big ambassador of remote working, I’ve been in the out-of-office environment for about 8 years now and I even write a blog about it. So I’m used to managing people and projects remotely.

"
product manager,"Product Management:

SendPulse target audience is small and medium-sized businesses. The peculiarity of this target audience is that it often lacks marketing budgets and in general, companies from this segment often disappear somewhere. Therefore, with such businesses, it is often impossible to even start talking about some complex technical projects, such as the integration of a website with a marketing service - it is both expensive and often incomprehensible for them.

But regardless of this, in three years in the position of Product Manager, me and my team achieved the fact that 15% of SendPulse active customers had been using Automation 360 functionality (had regular monthly activities in sending trigger messages during the last 6 months).

Project Management:

At the time of my joining the Automation 360 Team the senior developer who was also the team leader left the team. And instead of him, I appeared as the team leader. As it usually happens when team members change, a team enters a period of turbulence until all its members reach friendly coordinated work again. A360 Team wasn't an exception. I faced boycotting myself as a team leader by one developer, as well as fights between other team members. But I (before that with no experience in managing a development team) still managed to lead the team through the turbulence stage and bring it to a plateau, when the whole team works harmoniously as one and regularly releases functional updates.
Product Manager (with Project Management function) at SendPulse.com

As the Product Manager of SendPulse me and my team were in charge for functioning and development of the following products:

- Automation 360. A360 is one of SendPulse primary services which allows companies to automate their direct marketing by building complex logical message chains using different communication channels. Since the release of the functional in 2017 and to Feb 2021, the number of users has grown from 0,4% of active users in 2017 to 15% of active users in 2021. The number of emails sent through this functionality has increased from 30 thousand a month in 2017 to 8 million emails a month in 2021. We were constantly performing functionality revision and improvements.

- SendPulse Fix. Additional SendPulse product, which allows you to enrich the database for further use in the email marketing practice. Our team released SP Fix MVP. Later SP Fix was integrated into the Email Service.

- Website monetization. In partnership with PushPush.io, we enabled the SendPulse Web Push customers to monetize their subscriber databases by sending them ads in web push notifications. In fact, we created another reason why customers should use the SendPulse Web Push Service.

My responsibilities as a PdM:

creating product roadmap, maintaining and prioritizing product backlog, market research, defining the product strategy, defining product requirements, defining the points of product growth.

As a Project Manager I implemented kanban framework for my team with scrum attributes and performed next activities: 

collect and agree product requirements from stakeholders, creation of technical specifications, holding team meetings such as assessment of task, sprint planning, sprint retrospective, demo, 1 to 1 and daily stand-ups, control over the terms of the release of the functionality, maintenance of project documentation.

I managed product team which was made up of front-end, back-end developers and QAs, designers. I communicated with the product owner. I created, maintained, and prioritized the backlog. I supervised the marketing team on issues related to communication with the end user of products created by my team as well as consulted the sales department on how to help the end user understand the value of our products.
I am a Product Manager with extensive experience in B2B and B2C marketing. However, I am also a Marketer focused on building long-term relationships with clients.

I've been working in marketing domain since 2008 and in retention marketing domain since 2011. I Have 3 years of experience in managing product development team and product development process. Currently I'm looking for a Product Manager position in a cosy company.

I do NOT consider the following domains: dating, gambling, pharma. 
Blockchain - depends on the project/product .

I am looking for a company in the midst of which the approaches to building communication resonate with the following principles:

- openness and transparency of relations
- recognition of the value of everyone
- striving for consensus
- respect for each other's interests
- confidence

If mentioned above is about your company I'll be happy to have my first interview with you. Contact me and we'll schedule our call.

Working as an IT Specialist in different fields for more than 4 years. Starting as a developer, I have moved my expertise into the Product / Project Management area.

My job experience has covered these companies:
- B-Sharks: FullStack Python / Web Developer, in a team working for the clients launching their startups or creating MVP versions of ideas.
 
- RoboHouse (Technical Project Manager): Company, launched from under the hood of B-Sharks, providing robotics services. The company has had two main streams: Educational Schools and Development Department. Within the Development Department, I have been leading small project teams of 3-6 people, being responsible for Software Delivery for the Robotics Projects MVPs.

- Human Robotics (Lead Project Manager): A startup, creating a robot-assistant for the coworkings and factories, that is able to provide consultations for the clients, analyze key elements inside the premises, etc. 
The result has been shown at USF Contest at the beginning of 2020. Please, don't mind taking a look at the TV plot, shown on ""ТСН Україна"", just type in ""Хьюго ТСН"" on YouTube :)

- Z-Digital Group (Founder & CEO): Attempt to launch my own outsourcing company, applying all the knowledge of previous job experience. As a result, the company has been successfully working for more than 3 years, and currently is being successfully sold to the production holding. 
My responsibilities in Z-Digital Group covered everything connected with launching a startup - management, development expertise, hiring new staff etc. 

Work experience as a Product Manager resulted in 40+ projects of mobile apps, SaaS products etc. developed under my management.
I want to learn more from the people who are more experienced than me. I really want to join a team of professionals that could push me forward (as do I). 

I possess myself as a workaholic, and my previous job has taught me to work 24/7 (well, 22/7 to be fair). I have no problems with working under somebody's mentorship and really hope to make the company I will join better.

The thing that I am expecting from my new workafamily is a possibility to build a career: straight goals, transparent flow of self-improvement, so I can stick to it, create new goals and crush them. This is what really important for me."

Hello,

I am delighted to welcome you to my page and thank you for accepting my offer.

Furthermore, I have implemented various tools in my company that have enhanced production and customer communication. By systematizing and documenting the company's processes, I have successfully reduced time, labor, and financial costs.

My secret sаuse is the ability to keep a high level of happiness for each stakeholder engaged in a project on different stages.
I am that person in the middle between customer’s needs, internal R&D team, external technology and market trends.

I worked directly with client's top managers and business owners from Middle East, EU, US, and post-soviet countries, managing projects from pre-sales to commissioning stages.

With technical education and marketing background I have a solid understanding of the Industry 4.0, AI/ML, Internet of Things, AR/VR technologies and project delivery.

product manager,"
Throughout my professional journey across diverse sectors, including customer service, insurance, banking, and entrepreneurship, I've collaborated with various teams, gaining invaluable experience. At IBM, leading a regional team, we successfully forged partnerships with top corporations and established a distribution network essential for global initiatives. Post-IBM, I had the privilege to assist Ukrainian businesses in their expansion into new markets and tackled investment challenges while launching my own startup.

Together with a dedicated team, we recently transformed a two-decade-old mining software company, shifting its focus from post-Soviet markets to North America, Australia, and Latin America. This collective endeavor encompassed rebranding, redesigning, and operational restructuring, solidifying the company's global standing. Building on this collective achievement, I am enthusiastic about joining visionary teams and organizations aimed at significant growth and evolution.

- Ensured a smooth and successful launch by coordinating media efforts and helping validate and test the product.
- Did my best to stay on top of a scope and stakeholder management chaos. 


As a biz dev at Soopio:
- Succesfully went from an idea by two roommates in a hostel to bootsraping investments and launching our product. 
- Found subscribers to our food delivery services, mainly through cold calling and LinkedIn networking with small business owners.
In summary:
- Certified data analyst: Python, SQL, Tableau, A/B tests, funnel optimization, cohort analysis
- Trained in Waterfall and Agile project management
- Startup experience (business development and negotiations)
- Led a marketing team at a German De-Fi startup
- Understanding of key product metrics
- US educated 

In a bit more detail: 

- Organized a healthy food startup Soopio in San Jose, California, along with two co-founders. 

Though the startup ultimately had to close its doors due to visa issues of our CEO and myself, it was a great hands-on experience in product development and idea validation (turns out everyone loves borscht!), negotiating with suppliers, generating and converting leads.

- Managed a distributed team of designers, copywriters, and influencers for deus.finance, a De-Fi startup. 

I learned the product inside and out, rewrote the whitepaper in collaboration with the dev team, polished the website interface with the designer, and coordinated public releases in preparation for the launch. 

I also coordinated with the community managers to gather feedback about the product, and reported deadlines, budgets, and scopes of each task under my supervision to the DAO (key stakeholders).

- Currently working on a project related to mental health, and assisting with the development of an application in the same field. Both projects are in the process of prototyping their MVPs.
I'm looking for a role that would allow me to utilize my business and analytical acumen for data-driven, customer-centric product management.

A hybrid schedule with an ability to work remotely for extended periods of time is preferred."

Developed a clear vision of how to solve the project's daily problems, and eliminate the interference from the performers workflow. Formed team coordination on a common goal in the most efficient way. That position taught me of understanding the balance between achieving the goals of the project and the client, achieving the financial and business goals by taking into account the team members' motivation and career goals.
For more than 5 years I was working with a team of developers where was involved in work on projects architecture development and software development as a Quality Assurance specialist. The result of the work was understanding the minimum required set of processes for a variety of any size projects. Moreover, I became more experienced in the organization of the necessary activities for all stages of the software product life cycle to ensure the required quality of the product.

product manager,"For 5+ years in IT, I have gained great skills and experience in such areas as bussines analysis, project management, product analytics and product management.

Collecting and documenting is an important process that I deal with on a regular basis. The ability to collect and describe requirements, for which I first conduct market research and comparison of competitors, is my strength, in which I have extensive experience.

I have worked as a project manager for more than two years and I have a lot of experience in building and leading the development process. I organized the development process in both Kanban and Scrum methodology. Increasing the efficiency and productivity of the team is a goal that I can achieve.

I took the first steps in product management with the understanding that hypotheses should be built on the basis of data. I have experience with Google analytics, AWS Quicksight. I want to note my skills in building a product analytics system from scratch.

As a product manager, I work effectively to improve product target metrics. On the way to this, I am looking for hypotheses by communicating with existing customers, studying the market, analyzing competitors. Next, I highlight the MVP, which will make it possible to quickly and economically test the hypothesis - this is the secret of rapid and successful product growth and this is what I can do well.

I collect hypotheses in a prioritized roadmap, which allows stakeholders to understand the direction of the product.

After the release, I check each of the hypotheses with AB tests, which makes it possible to understand the quantitative impact on the product.

I bring a wealth of experience as a proficient and highly skilled manager with an entrepreneurial mindset. I have successfully launched my own startup from scratch, despite lacking prior product experience. Throughout the journey, I demonstrated resilience and adaptability, undergoing several pivots to align with market dynamics.

One of my key accomplishments was assembling and leading a talented team, which involved conducting over 100 interviews to attract individuals who shared our vision. Together, we developed and iterated on a minimal viable product (MVP) while rigorously testing product hypotheses. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain deep insights into the challenges and intricacies of the product development lifecycle.

During the final pivot, our focus shifted towards the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. As part of this strategic shift, we prepared for our own initial coin offering (ICO) and successfully developed a comprehensive product that addressed key market demands. However, despite our best efforts, the project was impacted by the collapse of the cryptocurrency market, leading to the difficult decision to wind down operations.

This immersive experience not only enhanced my ability to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty but also fostered a relentless pursuit of self-improvement and resilience in overcoming challenges throughout the process of building my own startup.

During this journey, I honed my skills in self-directed learning, continuously seeking new knowledge and acquiring relevant expertise to address emerging issues. The dynamic nature of the startup environment demanded quick thinking, adaptability, and the ability to proactively identify and solve problems. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and equipped me with a strategic mindset to navigate complex situations.
I am looking for a position in a product company or a growth-stage startup where I can contribute to an interesting product. My expectations include opportunities for professional growth, engaging and challenging tasks, and a supportive and friendly team environment."

Experience with big IT companies

This project was related to the production of a video for the Japanese corporation Shineyi Kaishi Corporation. It was a very large project that included risks associated with time constraints and a language barrier within the team. Due to the high demands of the client for the quality of the final product, we had to divide the project into many parts and distribute them to multiple freelancers without a guarantee that they would be able to complete the task on time.

However, thanks to the proper distribution of resources and the correct organization of the process, we were able to successfully complete the project. Although we faced risks associated with the language barrier and despite the fact that the team was from different countries, we were able to provide them with all the necessary information and instructions in the language they were proficient in.

In addition, we took responsibility for task distribution among freelancers and monitored their progress to ensure that the project was on track and our budget was not increased due to problems with task execution. Ultimately, thanks to our effort and technical capabilities, we were able to provide the client with a high-quality product despite the risks associated with this project.

- Colleagues often called me a ""diplomat"" — I know how to control emotions (well, almost always :), understand the causes of events, find and offer compromise solutions; 
- I take and bear responsibility. If I promised, I will do it 100% (well, okay, 99.9%, you never know what can happen).

What I am looking for now:
I want to work and develop a new product. It is not very interesting to work as a product manager responsible for a small narrow direction, I prefer ambitious goals, participation in the formation of a product development strategy. The remote format is more suitable, but I am ready to consider the option of working in an office if you have an office in Kyiv (while I settled here). I can also think about relocation.

So if you need someone like me — I’m open to your proposals.

product manager,"- launched a company
- trained and managed several sales, leadgen, marketing and talent acquisition teams, really proud of the ex-team members evolution
- managed to get my hands dirty with almost any activity in a software company except for back-end development, network engineering and DevOps
I'm a multi-discipline IT manager with over 10 years of experience looking for the opportunity to use my varied skillset for good.
 
Briefly:
 
1. Started my career as a digital marketer, content writer, editor, and lead generation specialist in an outsourcing company targeting the USA, the UK, the EU, and the Nordics regions.
2. After a few years switched to lead gen/sales, with activities ranging from sourcing leads on Linkedin, Upwork, and other fl platforms to launching cold email outreach campaigns, doing cold calls, and creating all kinds of content (team profiles, presentations, landing pages, website copy, emails, etc.)
3. Worked as a business analyst and PM on several projects I've attracted.
4. Established a sales/lead gen team within the company. Set up processes, workflows, and compensation schemes. Interviewed candidates; performed day-to-day management and training of team members.
5. Established a Talent Acquisition unit. Set up processes, attracted, interviewed, trained, and managed the unit day-to-day, simultaneously running the Sales/Leadgen team.
6. Participated in idea generation, planning, and development of 2 company products (B2B SaaS).
7. Became a general manager of a newly founded Kyiv-based Ukrainian IT company. 
Was solely responsible for everything - from legal and finances to talent acquisition and HR.
8. As the company seized to exist due to the ruzzian invasion, turned into a B2B marketing jack-of-all-trades, helping my previous company launch several lead gen and marketing campaigns, perform reputation management and other minor things here and there.

Now I'm looking for new interesting challenges related to Project- and Product Management, Process Setup, Sales/Talent Aquisition. Ideally - in a startup or product company with a nice idea and great people. The latter is the most important.

product manager,"When it comes to my achievements, I am proud of several accomplishments throughout my career. For instance, in my previous role as a product manager, I successfully led a cross-functional team in developing and launching a new software product that increased our company's revenue by 30%. I also implemented a new project management system that resulted in a 20% increase in team productivity and a significant reduction in project delays.

Additionally, I am proud of my contributions to improving customer satisfaction rates in a previous role as a customer success manager. Through implementing a new customer feedback program and working closely with the product team to address customer pain points, we were able to increase our overall customer satisfaction rate from 80% to 95%.

Overall, I believe that my track record of success in driving business growth and improving customer satisfaction makes me a valuable asset to any team or company.
As a project and product manager with 4 years of experience, I have worked on various projects and tasks throughout my career. Some of these include:

Developing and launching products for clients in IT, finance, and media.
Managing the planning and implementation of projects, including complex projects with large budgets and tight deadlines.
Ensuring effective communication and collaboration between different departments and teams.
Being responsible for strategic planning and product development, which led to increased company revenue and customer base.
I have worked with various technologies, including Agile methodologies, JIRA, Asana, Trello, Google Analytics, and many others. Currently, I am a project leader responsible for planning, managing, and coordinating all stages of projects.

In my work, I always strive for personal development and improving my professional skills. For example, I want to improve my leadership and communication skills to become a more effective team leader. Additionally, I am constantly improving my knowledge in the field of the latest technologies and innovations to stay up to date with the latest trends and changes in my industry.
As a professional manager, I am always open to new challenges and opportunities, but I also have clearly defined preferences and limitations. For example, I do not want to work for a company with a bad reputation or a history of ethical violations. I also do not want to work in a disorganized environment where there is no systematic approach to project management. Overall, I would like to find a job in a dynamic and growing company that will allow me to demonstrate my professional skills and provide space for personal growth and development."

product manager,"
First several years of my career I was working in FMCG domain with ERP (SAP) implementation projects as an internal consultant. That involved a lot of project management work (project planning, stakeholder management etc), but also required close work with the system itself including testing and debugging. I was primarily responsible for the requirements engineering on quite a deep technical level.

Moving to the travel domain I have transitioned to the product ownership/management roles being the chief product owner for the B2B Hotel booking platform (3 teams on-site + distributed stakeholders). Apart from work on roadmap, product vision, work with the teams and the stakeholders in this project I was doing a lot of prototyping (Axure RP, InVision, Figma), setting up product and service monitoring dashboards in Grafana, creating automated test scripts in Groovy :) 

In my current project that is in Healthcare IT I have changed several roles from managing the team responsible for the product delivery to our partners moving back to product with the focus on integrations (Web and Mobile SDK, FHIR API) and the clinician's experience (UI and backend flows to deliver patient's reports to doctors). In current project I work a lot with Miro, Figma, Honeycomb and Tableau, but comparing to my previous products I miss opportunity to get my hands dirty with some real stuff as a lot of my current capacity is taken by regulatory conversations, alignments and documentation.

I am looking for a product that I will be able to relate to on a personal level too. I love to be passionate about my work and love to share this passion with my team. So my primary focus is on finding such a product.

product manager,"Thanks to my ability to build features/products from scratch, I was able to create a prototype and test it on potential users within a couple of days. For example, there was a live test on production where we implemented a feature using simple tools in 2 hours, and the next day we realized that it was needed and it worked.

Developed a strategy for phased product changes based on the main ""Jobs"" of the customers. We solved the problem of making many small changes that don't ultimately result in exponential business growth, as well as making big features that also don't result in exponential growth, even though we invest a ton of resources into them. Managed 2 cross-functional product teams (about 19 people).

Regarding the results:
Increased user engagement by +30% and increased conversion to service purchase for the product (B2B) by +40%.
Increased the main business metrics(transactions) by +60%
Increased the activation metrics of new users by +20%
Increased the retention metrics b2b by +25%
I'm a business goals and happy customers oriented expert, with a wealth of experience in data analysis, web and mobile development, customer development, and user experience design. I actually started my career as a UX designer, but over the past 8 years, I've developed a diverse set of skills that make me a true tech geek!

Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of industries, including SaaS, productivity tools, mobile apps, HR and recruitment, e-commerce (both B2C and retail), big portals and media sites, and even IoT. I even have experience launching my own startup!

When it comes to product development, I bring a ton of skills to the table, including CRT and FRT, UX artifacts like CJM, Dif Analysis, Mental Models, Customer Value Mapping, and JTBD. I'm also skilled in Problem and Solution Interviews, Usability Testing, Job Stories, Unit-Economy Models, RAT, and MVP.
Working with teams in frameworks (Scrum, Discovery-Delivery)

Excellent knowledge of how to test hypotheses/ideas with minimal effort and bury them in advance before they waste a lot of money
Testing (live data, interviewing, surveys, usability testing) and the ability to correctly interpret results
Technical skills. As I work closely with the development team, I have a good understanding of programming principles, system architecture, and infrastructure, and have a sufficient level of proficiency in html/css/js (which is very helpful in creating prototypes and conducting A/B tests in production)
Analysis of user data. I work at an advanced level with analytics services (GA, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Fullstory), as well as have experience in correctly collecting this data.

My expertise extends to both web and mobile platforms, and I've conducted over 120 interviews and usability tests (including those with English-speaking participants) as part of my customer development work. So, if you're looking for a seasoned pro who can help take your product to the next level, look no further!

product manager,"The management of the development from the first user story to the final release as a single product manager and decision-maker alongside the customer. 

Quick dive into a new domain of online gambling, a full first game launched 1 month after trial completion.
My experience in the last 2 projects is: 
 
1. Developed a product from scratch, composed roadmaps of a multicomponent product, and launched a high-load system in the digital marketing domain. Orchestrated the transfer of data and users, developed admin panels for managers and customers. 

2. Lead the development of online gambling software: taking the project from the simple BRD and launching it to the customers (coordinated the work of several dev teams, UI and studio designers, sound engineers, studio technicians, CRMs, and other related people). 

Worked with 3 remote dev teams, designers, content writers, SEO specialists, etc. 

Certified Business Analyst (with honors ;) ) .
I'm looking for a team to work on a socially important product (not outsource/out staff), having a strong desire to be useful to the community. 
After working in the gambling and gaming-related industry, I am sure these are not my domains, as well as crypto. 
Size (of the company) doesn't matter ;)"

Dear Sirs,  
Over the last decade, I've built a career around one simple truth: to win and keep 
customers, you have to genuinely care about solving their problems. This customer-focus served me well as a Senior Product Manager of Marketing at Technology & Business, a software company. Research, surveys, and interviews helped me create a winning 
marketing strategy, as well as redesign and build a modernized website our target 
audience would love. Product walk-throughs and user data uncovered several issues with the UX and core product. I wanted to do better and make good products great, so, I enrolled in an immersive UX and Product Management course and switched careers.  

Working as a Senior Product Manager, I've been responsible for coordinating GTM 
strategy, the full product development lifecycle, including strategic planning, CustDev, QA testing, and product/feature launches for multiple clients. My ability to ensure stakeholder buy-in and promote team/cross-departmental collaboration has allowed me to launch profitable products.  

While all candidates should have excellent communication and technical skills, I think my background in product management gives me an edge with in-depth insight into your customers and the strategies they're most likely to implement. I also approach problemsolving like an engineer, have an extensive background in both market research and Agile methodology, and am motivated by results. I know there's no place for ego; my primary goal, always, is to give my teams the focus and support they need to win. 

I have technical skills (Python, SQL) to work effectively with developers. I use the 
following libraries in my daily work: Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. 

Now, I'd like to find a permanent home as a Senior Product Manager where I can have a lasting impact. I'd love to connect and see if that home is with your team!

13+ as a Product Manager
9+ as Product Owner
I started 10 startups as Founder and investor
10+ Startups from scratch for clients as PM, PO

As a web developer, I began my IT career in 2000, during the first wave of the Internet. In 2004, I founded AB Design, a web design company.

By 2006, I had grown the company to a staff of 10 and moved into a business center office. My role had evolved to focus on being the CEO, Product Manager/Owner, and managing communication with key clients and crucial client sales. For other responsibilities, I hired additional staff.

However 2008, the global financial crisis hit, and many clients stopped projects. Instead of firing staff, I invested in my startups while continuing to provide software outsourcing services.

I launched multiple startups between 2009 and 2012

It's well-known that only 3% of startups become successful, and the rest will close immediately or within a few years. Unfortunately, none of my startups are still in operation today. However, I gained valuable experience from these ventures and did not regret taking the chance. 

At this point, I have lost interest in starting my startup, as I paid for my experience with my own money

In 2011, I began offering mobile application development services to clients and grew my staff to 60 people, simultaneously working on 15+ projects of medium to high complexity.

However, in 2015, I decided to retire early following the F.I.R.E. principle after my daughter was born. My priorities shifted toward family, self-development, and freedom from the stresses of entrepreneurship. 

During retirement, sometimes I had involved in the work of my company. My company continued to work under the management of a hired CEO. I have followed all the IT trends and acted as a private consultant. Nevertheless, it became my hobby.

I occasionally participated in my company's work during my retirement, but it became more of a hobby. I had hoped that with a hired CEO managing the company, it would maintain the same level of success as when I left. Still, unfortunately, without my active involvement, the company shrank to simply supporting existing customers and maintaining a minimal remote staff. 

In 2018, I decided to avoid entrepreneurial risks and closed my company.

Hello!

Regarding products and projects, my list includes solutions for SpeechTech, FinTech, investment management digitalization, and various e-commerce. I'm a fast learner and I'm ready to dig into the new field as much as expand my knowledge in the areas I have already worked with.

product manager,"In a large product company, where each agile team was responsible for its own sub-product, my team represented one of the few profitable directions at the time of my leaving. It was achieved with me in the product owner's role.

Successful management of a multinational, multicultural agile team. Statistically, it was expressed in the risen number of story points delivered per sprint as well as the increased work satisfaction score across the team.

Pushed the comprehensive change to the UX approach after realizing that people used our app more like a gauge rather than something interactive. Helped with a churn rate quite a lot.
Involvement in the development of oil wells drilling software, physical access control systems, fitness club CRM, and more. 

I have a degree in mechanical engineering and thus knowledge in physics, mechanics, mathematics. Plus a reasonably strong understanding of such domains as oil & gas, automotive, aerospace, miltech. 

Thanks to the significant copywriting experience and strong English, my documentation and requirements tend to be well-structured and easy to understand. 

I consider effective communication on each of the SDLC stages a key to a successful, profitable product and I've seen projects failing through the lack thereof.

product manager,"- Built Infrastructure & Platform roadmaps and drove execution. Set OKRs on the team/domain levels. Managed multiple teams.
- Drove FinOps adoption across the organization and reduced cloud costs by 25%. Developed tagging and labeling policies. Introduced metrics: costs per application, costs per client, and costs per environment.
- Migrated a legacy solution that manages 1000+ remote machines to the cloud and introduced GitOps. 
- Launched a platform for automating the business processes in the company. Engineers and citizen developers adopted it as a tool for business automation (200+ workflows).
- Launched a startup. The product was a platform for automating business tasks with Python. Users can run Python scripts on schedule or by clicking a button without infrastructure headaches. The goal was to dramatically simplify the process of implementing and delivering user automation to the production environment. In 4 months, we launched the product, gained 200 users, and got an interview invitation from Y-Combinator.
- Built multiple ETL solutions (Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Serverless Framework, different data warehouse engines, and databases).
I thrive at the intersection of product development and technical expertise. My passion lies in creating products that solve real-world problems and drive business success. Whether working alongside engineers, designers, sales, or support teams, I am committed to delivering the best solutions through collaboration and innovative thinking.

Throughout my career, I have gained diverse experience across the product development lifecycle, from initial ideation to technical partnerships and solution architecture. With a strong technical background, I excel at building scalable and resilient systems, APIs, infrastructure and operations, data analytics platforms, and ETL systems.

My unique blend of technical expertise and product mindset allows me to approach challenges with a holistic perspective and drive successful outcomes.

Prior to transitioning into the role of a product manager, one of my notable accomplishments as an engineer involved spearheading the development of an internal platform designed to automate various business processes. Despite my primary engineering responsibilities, I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with stakeholders and users to gain valuable insights into their challenges and provide effective solutions.

Collaborating with two dedicated teammates, we conceived the notion of establishing a standardized approach to business automation within the company. Given our extensive expertise in process automation, we embarked on an entrepreneurial endeavor within the organization, taking charge of all aspects ranging from back-end and front-end development to infrastructure setup, user communication, and roadmap creation. It was akin to running a startup within the company, driven by our passion and commitment.

Over time, our team grew up, and as the platform evolved, it grew in complexity. We successfully transitioned all business automation processes, encompassing hundreds of workflows, onto our robust and comprehensive platform. This migration marked a significant milestone in our journey, consolidating our position as the go-to solution for efficient and streamlined business automation within the organization.
There are three key factors that are crucial to me:
1/ Interesting and promising product.
2/ Collaboration with a team of skilled professionals.
3/ Unrestricted opportunities for professional development."

Interesting projects"
product manager,"
In short: I'm transforming needs into solutions. 

Long version: 
As a product manager, I work on finding the needs and gaps and understanding how they can be solved. Through research, prototyping, experiment, and analysis I create a hypothesis and test it. Then I take my results, create a solution, and drive the implementation> feedback analysis>improvement with the team. 

I've been in IT for 7 years, past 3 of them - on product position. I know how to understand the business needs, how to understand the user's pain, how to collect and analyze the data, how to work with the dev team, and how to speak each other's language.
These jobs are not for me: online gambling and betting, crypto&blockchain, dating, affiliate and advertising networks, any kind of outsource/outstaff companies.

I'd be happy to create products that make people's day-to-day lives easier, products for self-help and self-improvement, and, in general, products that make the world better."
