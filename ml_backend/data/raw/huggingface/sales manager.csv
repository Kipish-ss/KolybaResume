Currently, besides lead generation & closing, I successfully perform account management activities that leads to increasing deals to x1.5-x2 from initial scope. 

Let's chat to see if we could be a good teammates
I would love to work with a motivated, friendly, fast-paced team who are real pros and know their stuff. It’s a well-known fact, that if the salesperson doesn’t like what he is selling then the business is doomed. So it is really important for me to find the right people to work with, and then from my side, I will perform at my best to ensure growth and progress.  

Frankly, I don't like to perform lead generation activities and believe that this process MUST be covered by separate person.
If you're looking for a jack of all trades - sorry, but better keep scrolling through other candidacies' profiles. 

AND PLEASE, if you have ru/belarus clients or workers - DON'T MESSAGE ME."

sales manager,"Achievements:
- launching the business process of dealing with network coverage requests for B2B customers.
My telecom career started 14 years ago. I gained my first professional experience at the customer service division in B2B sales (I learned analytical, managerial, negotiation skills). 
Now I am dealing with network coverage requests of corporate customers. I am sure there can’t be effective sales and long-term relations with customers without high-quality service. 
I improved my analytical skills working on business cases focused on base stations construction for the needs of B2B customers. This process is a complicated chain of interactions with colleagues, contractors, customers, landlords, engineers. It involves calculations of payback, company’s revenue, technical solutions optimization, analyzing relevance of clients’ services, negotiating about equipment placement and rent rates, informing about radiofrequency radiation etc. In the course of my work I need to negotiate with managers of all levels within the company. I see openness and honesty to be a key to success for all types of interaction.
I am constantly learning for my personal and professional development. I have been learning English since March 2018. The global trends increased my interest in social media. In December 2020 I have chosen the course on content marketing which also includes copyrighting as I see it is in demand for freelance work. It is interesting not only to learn these skills but to learn how to find clients, which is especially relevant to my sales skills. 
I deliver training courses to my colleagues on the life cycle of customers’ requests on coverage. During the course I always have good contact with the audience, refer to participants, encourage questions, provide examples, prove the information with photos, digits etc.
I consider the position of B2B sales manager or Project manager would be a good step in my professional development. I like the sense of Adrenaline and proud when the deal is closed.
I respect employers which provide decent financial motivation, high corporate standards and possibility to use the knowledge of English."

Last 6 years I was working as a travel manager for Elite Tourism Club “The Seventh Heaven”- a leader in the luxury tourism business in Ukraine. We did our best to ensure the best quality of services for our VIP clients thus gaining the profit for the company. The core goal of the company was to sell the most expensive and high-quality services to the customers, such as stays at five-star hotels, super yachts rentals, villas rentals, private jets flights, concierge services. My task was to persuade well-experienced travelers that they needed to choose the very hotel or yacht I recommended and ensure these travelers get the best experience after making this decision. It was always about negotiation, customer service, the ability to work in a fast-paced environment and bring as much profit as possible to the company. 

        Now I am looking for a change. I consider it as a step-up in my career, that’s why I am applying for this position. I looked at the position requirements, duties, and obligations. I have 6 years of experience in customer service and support, my English is advanced, French is intermediate, Russian and Ukrainian are native languages. I am always dedicated to my career and self-motivated. I proved to be reliable and effective service and support oriented team-player, that's why I think I would be a great asset to the company.
I expect my new dream job will be interesting, the communication within the team will be friendly, the projects will be challenging, there will be trainings, workshops, and other kinds of tuition. Also, I would appreciate it if there is a possibility to grow within the company."

Hey everyone,

Here is some info on my experience if you decided that my profile is worth checking :)

I started as a sales/account manager at a Saas company focusing on B2B services. The company is mainly helping other Saas companies to build their eCommerce integrations. I needed to become versatile in business analysis since each company had its unique needs. In addition to that, I worked closely with our marketing team and development team to help them build their roadmap for the upcoming features and updates. On top of that, I was managing sales and SDR teams and played a key role in strategic planning and execution. Our clients were usually from different industries such as inventory management, shipping & order fulfillment, logistics, Email marketing, you Name it.

After I left the first company, I joined a web development company specializing in Magento development. There I have put to use all my knowledge in terms of sales, process automation, and team management.

Almost one year later I joined another company as a project manager. Since it is a start-up, there is never one line of work that you work on. You have to everywhere in the initial stages of the project, especially when things change fast. 

To summarize, I can say that I have a great luggage of experience in sales, sales management, B2B sales, project management, and eCommerce APIs.

I will be happy to get in touch and learn more about your project or service.

Have a good one!

- controlled end-to-end sales operations, from lead generation to deal closure and retention.

- optimized customer onboarding and set up the flows, improving team communication flows.

- optimized resources by involving fewer higher-ups, keeping things practical and profitable.

- restructured customer journey and introduced new communication channels and methods for better conversion and retention.

- nurtured sales assistants to work with outstaff segment, personally negotiated with business partners to set up new cooperations, expanding the company's network.

Afterwards got acquainted with the world of cryptocurrency, worked for the first crypto project for 6 months as a community manager and was made a team leader. Got one more project in crypto where all the community support department was found and taught by myself: finding the candidates, interviewing them, checking their knowledge, teaching them everything about the project, managing and organizing their work. My whole team was working successfully, was motivated and strong. I was also working as an Upwork manager for freelance: finding the clients, analyzing their needs and giving tasks to my small team (web designer and programmer) for the clients to get what they need. I was also responsible for my team’s Salary. In addition, had experience working as a Sales Manager for almost a year, successfully negotiated with the clients and sold outsource/outstaff services.

After graduating from high school in Ukraine, I entered the University of Economics in Poland in Radom, where I studied software development for mobile devices. After finishing the 2nd year of study, I ended my practice at TEKOM polska. While studying at the university, I was drawn to try something else. I wanted to find an activity from which my eyes would light up with fire. And it turned out that this is the ability to sell.

I entered the real labor market and began working in an insurance agency, where I began to gain practical knowledge and skills from the real situation in the Polish market. And I got the first experience, when depending on your result your income depended. Together with my founder, we created a competitive formula for foreign citizens to insure their car on very favorable financial conditions for them. The distribution of which I was engaged in and exponentially increased the client base in our company. Having entered into a trusting relationship, I became an intermediary of an insurance company and worked remotely.

Then I got into a young developing travel company in Zakopane. Initially, I was an employee with a fixed Salary, but my skills, proposals for the development of the company and sales success in the market of saturated competition led me to become a co-founder of the company and I headed the sales department, the last 2 seasons under my leadership there were 2 people. Together with the main founder of the company, we came up with the Name of the company, invented and introduced a completely new type of excursions to the summer local tourism market. In this regard, we have made a huge step forward among competitors. Under the Name of our company, I also organized private VIP tours at the request of the client.

And now I am in search of a new work experience and a new career step in the sales position.

sales manager,"Let me tell you about Jane, a store owner who was struggling to make sales on her website. Despite having a beautiful website, she just couldn't seem to convert visitors into customers. But that all changed when she decided to treat her website like a sales funnel.

First, we took a look at her website's analytics and identified that the majority of visitors were leaving her site without taking any action. This is a common problem, as studies have shown that 96% of website visitors are not ready to buy. But by using a sales funnel approach, we were able to guide those visitors through a personalized journey that led them to take action and convert.

One of the key elements we implemented was the use of landing pages. Instead of directing visitors to her homepage, we created targeted landing pages for different segments of her audience. This helped to increase conversions by over 120%.

We also made sure to include clear calls to action on every page, making it easy for visitors to take the next step in the buying process. By making it easy for visitors to take action, we were able to increase conversions by an additional 70%.

Additionally, we segmented her Email list and sent targeted Email campaigns, which led to an increase in sales by 50%.

Finally, we used A/B testing to optimize different elements of the website and make data-driven decisions about how to improve the user experience. This led to a further 60% increase in conversions.

All in all, by treating her website like a sales funnel, we were able to increase Jane's sales by an incredible 300%! And the best part? We didn't have to spend a dime on advertising to achieve these results.

By employing these strategies and maintaining a proactive, client-centric approach, I have successfully increased the client base, driving business growth, and contributing to the overall success of the organization.
Consulting or training: Although I may have some experience in knowledge transfer and consulting, my strengths are more related to active sales, persuasion and establishing long-term relationships with clients. A job in consulting or training may require other skills and specialised knowledge.

sales manager,"
As a Tech Sales Specialist, I have extensive experience using a variety of sales tools, including Salesforce, Salesloft, Gong, Apollo, Close, Linkedin Navigator, Marketo, Klaviyo, and Outreach. 

One project I worked on involved implementing a sales automation tool, Salesloft, into our sales process. With my previous experience using the tool, I was able to configure it to fit our specific needs and train our sales team on how to effectively use the platform. As a result, our sales team was able to more efficiently manage their workflows, resulting in a 25% increase in lead-to-customer conversion rate.

Another project involved integrating Salesforce with LinkedIn Navigator in order to provide sales reps with a more complete view of their prospects. By leveraging the insights offered by LinkedIn Navigator, our sales team was able to better tailor their messaging and more effectively engage prospects. This led to a 15% increase in closed deals and a 10% increase in average deal size.

Additionally, I utilized Gong's conversation intelligence platform to help coach our sales team on effectively handling objections raised during calls. By analyzing call recordings and providing actionable insights, our team was able to improve their objection handling and increase their close rates by 5%.

Lastly, I implemented Klaviyo for our Email marketing campaigns and leveraged its automation capabilities to engage our audience. By targeting our messaging based on specific customer behaviour, we were able to see a 40% increase in Email open rates and a 25% increase in click-through rates.

Overall, my experience with these sales tools has allowed me to contribute to the success of multiple projects, resulting in significant improvements at each stage of the sales process. I am committed to staying up-to-date on the latest advancements and best practices in sales technology. I will continue to leverage this knowledge to benefit my clients and colleagues.

I don't want to lie to customers"
sales manager,"As a businessman I had a promising startup with 10 emoloyees and a branch of 7 locations. As a sales man In Govitall increased revenue of a project in 5 times only in 5 months.
For the past 2 years I had my own startup and was a CEO of the company. We created a brand new service for my country (eco waterless carwash) and were trying to change the way people take care not only of their cars but also of the nature. The main Idea is that we don't need water to clean the car so it can be cleaned anywhere (any parking) without any harm to people, car and nature. As it's a new product for the market we didn't have any chance to copy a marketing strategy from someone so we created everything by our own hands. As a starup we didn't have a big team so I took part in every process. Marketing strategy, sales, companys mission and vision, communication on every level and even the way our uniform and bottles look. I was hiring people, checking and giving taks in CRM, created my sales team and teached them everything and always looking for any opportunities to improve our service, increase brand loyalty and become dream service for users. 

1 year before I created startup I started working as a sales manager in IT company and actually worked there for almost 3 years. in first 6 month I increased profit of my project in almost 5 times (at this moment I was only sales person in team). Working both inbound and outbound sales, created huge clients database well organized, implemented new sales channels, increased customer return rate. I was able to well organize all the process so it gave me ability to create my startup. Company was satisfied with my results so we cooperated like this for 2 more years. 

It's my experience for the past 3 years i do believe it shows the best what I'm capable of.
Before had experience in sales, tech support team lead, and few businesses.

Always believed that people should try to improve themselves, I speak only 3 languages so it's definitely something that needs to be improved. Becoming better manager - I do believe you get tested as a manager with different obstacles that make you a better leader. 

Business teached me that you just can't know everything, but should be willing to adapt fast. Even if I don't know how to do something I'll find the way out!

For a long time now I’ve been working on developing local brands on the west part of Ukraine. I was really a fan of creating content for brands in different niches, so for now my experience in SMM is around 4 years and experience in SEO-writing – around 1 year.

I have been working as a sales manager in the auto business for about 10 years. Engaged in various areas, starting from sales of used cars and ending with sales of special equipment.

Building Customer Relationships: As a Sales Manager, my primary focus was to understand customer needs. This involved an active listening approach to identify their requirements, desires and budget. Each client is a unique individual, so it was important to find an individual approach to each of them. This helped create long-term mutually beneficial relationships with customers, which in turn led to a positive impact on the company's reputation.

Product presentation: A well-thought-out presentation of cars was one of the key points in the sales process. I deeply studied the technical characteristics, advantages and capabilities of each car in order to know all the nuances of the product and help customers make the right choice. I also often conducted test drives to give customers the opportunity to test the cars in person and make sure of their reliability.

Inquiries processing and sales management: My job involved constantly processing inquiries from potential customers. This required effective use of CRM systems and other tools to track potential deals and control the sales process. I ensured timely responses to inquiries and actively worked with all stages of the sale, from the first contact with the client to the signing of the agreement.

Developing my own skills: The auto business is constantly changing, so I constantly improved my skills and knowledge about new technologies, automotive trends and sales strategies. Interaction with colleagues, participation in trainings and conferences helped to expand one's horizons and become more competent in one's role.

Post-sale customer relationship management: Closing a deal does not end my communication with customers. An important aspect of my job was to ensure a high level of satisfaction after the sale. This included solving any questions or problems that may have arisen after purchase, as well as providing additional information about service and accessories.

Results: Thanks to the experience of working as a Sales Manager in the automotive business, I was successful in achieving the set sales goals and also increased customer loyalty. My efforts helped to increase the turnover and income of the company, as well as to expand the client base.

Intrigued by the emerging e-commerce sector, I then took on a role in B2B sales at a local E-commerce firm, further enhancing my sales and negotiation skills. My career then led me to Samsung Azerbaijan Branch, where I served as a Key Account Manager, overseeing crucial client relationships and strategically driving sales growth.

"
sales manager,"In my previous role as a Customer Service Team Lead, I implemented a new feedback collection system that led to a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores within six months.
To achieve this, I conducted a thorough analysis of customer feedback data and identified common pain points. Then, I collaborated with our development team to create a user-friendly feedback form, which we integrated into our customer support portal. Additionally, I organized regular training sessions for the support team to ensure they could address customer concerns effectively.
The impact was substantial. Customer satisfaction scores improved significantly, leading to a more positive company image and a 10% increase in customer retention rates. This accomplishment also contributed to our team receiving recognition for outstanding customer service within the company.
In my role as a customer service professional with over six years of experience, I have successfully completed numerous projects and tasks. These have included:

1. Customer Issue Resolution: I've consistently resolved customer issues, ranging from technical problems to billing inquiries, ensuring their satisfaction and retention.

2. Conflict Resolution: I've effectively mediated conflicts between customers and the company, finding win-win solutions that maintain positive relationships.

3. Building Strong Customer Relations: I've cultivated strong and lasting relationships with more than 5000 customers, fostering trust and loyalty through personalized interactions.

4. Technology Utilization: I've utilized various technologies such as CRM systems, live chat platforms, and ticketing systems to streamline customer interactions and improve efficiency.

5. Team Collaboration: Within my team, I've collaborated closely with colleagues to share insights and strategies for improving customer satisfaction.

Looking forward, I aim to continue improving in several areas:

1. Enhancing Technical Proficiency: Staying updated with the latest customer service technologies and tools to provide more efficient and effective support.

2. Empathy and Communication:  Continuously refining my empathetic communication skills to better understand and address customer needs.

3. Problem Solving: Developing a deeper understanding of complex issues to make quicker and more informed decisions in challenging situations.

4. Data Analytics: Utilizing data analytics to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, which can inform better service strategies.

Overall, my goal is to contribute to my team's success by delivering exceptional customer service and continuously improving the customer experience.
In my role, I avoid:

1. Inefficiency and wasting time/resources.
2. Ignoring valuable customer feedback.
3. Being unresponsive or slow in communication.
4. Showing disinterest in customer concerns.
5. Resisting change and technological advancements.
6. Creating negative customer experiences.

These principles help me provide better customer service."

sales manager,"
I've been in a sales manager for four and a half years. Within that time frame, I've spent two and a half years as a customer service manager at a cleaning company. In this capacity, my responsibilities encompassed discerning customer requirements, supervising staff, ensuring service quality, and gathering feedback.

Subsequently, I spent a year and a half at a corporate IT training center. During this period, my focus shifted to B2B sales, conducting webinars, maintaining quality standards, and managing the CRM system.

For the past 7 months, I've been immersed in the realm of SEO, working with an SEO company. My responsibilities involve sales targeting the United States, Canada, and Europe. In addition to pinpointing client needs, I also conduct preliminary analyses of their websites, taking into consideration the technical aspects, Ahrefs metrics, and SEO optimization,  presenting tailored solutions to clients.

sales manager,"
I’ve been in IT industry for 1,5 year. I started from being copywriter (build marketing cover letters to generate leads from UPWORK), then become a lead generator or pre-sale manager. On that position I was responsible for generating leads, promoting them to the next steps of sales process (via chat room) and all the paperwork before starting a new project. And finally, I grew up to the sales manager (or business development specialist) in the software company. There I improved my verbal English, work on the company’s network and was responsible for full cycle deal process — from intro call to singing contracts and starting the project.

To sum up — I’m really enthusiastic person, who is doing my best to become a real sales expert :)

sales manager,"It was a project about a new website for an IT company. We started in a standard way - a bid/a response/an estimation/a call. But in the process of communication and passing over the estimation we found common ground with the client, and the contract we got was twice as big as we intended from the beginning. 

One more challenge I had was lead generation according to a new scheme and plan. It was quite tough, and I managed to do it and even exceed the plan.
I've been working as a sales manager for 10+ years, in IT sphere - for 1,5 years. 

In IT sales my tasks were lead generation/finding people/bidding on Upwork and communication with the clients  - getting estimations from the developers and passing it to the potential clients. This comminucation was intended to result in a contract. 

I like communicating with people, I enjoy getting new contracts and the best reward for me is when after getting the work done the client returns with new plans and ideas and we can work again. 

I always try to think wide and see the task in general, and at the same time I try to look into the tiniest details in order to make the communication productive. 

I speak fluent English, and Russian and Ukrainian are my native languages, so feel free to contact me in any of them!

sales manager,"
I've been working in Sales and customer care field more than 8 years and now I've got a sharp aspiration to switch into the IT area.

I have strong soft skills and natural talent for connecting with people, excellent problem-solving and negotiation skills, deep theoretical knowledges of SDLC and Agile methodologies.
Now I'm looking for position of Sales / Account manager in IT area and would be delighted to apply my skills in this field ."
sales manager,"Im really proud of that in every company im one of the best sales. I try to study the product and bring some new ideas that will eventually bring more money to the company. As well I lived abroad for more than 8 years. This gives me an advantage when taking to potential clients since I know how they think and What they need.
I've been working in sales for the past 7 years. I worked in different fields from financial markets to web development. For the last 3 years, I've been working in a BPO business. My job is to close deals, sometimes help our agents pass their interviews with clients, and keep our clients satisfied. As well if the company wants to upsell I'm the guys they talk to about it. Right now I'm looking for a stable job in which I can grow financially and career-wise. 

Why I would make a great sales manager? Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why.

First of all, I always get the job done, no matter what time it is or if I have to work extra. I'm result-oriented so leaving work exactly at 6 if I have calls later is not my style. 

Second, I always try to find a win-win both for the company and the client. All of my conversations are friendly and I get straight to the point with the client so we don't waste each other's time. Only if I see that the client needs more small talk I would do that. But the main target that I have in my head is to close that person. 

And lastly, I have a lot of experience in different fields which gives me an advantage over people that only worked in one. I can look at an issue or task from a different perspective and support it with my 7 years of experience working with the whole world.
Im looking for a stable job that i can make a career out of. IT would be nice but if there are some amazing offers i will consider."

My career spanning two decades, I have honed my skills as a results-driven Business/Product Manager, exhibiting an unwavering commitment to achieving outcomes that matter. My extensive tenure equips me not only with the acumen to thrive in local market but also to navigate the complexities of the global business
landscape. Moreover, my fluency in adhering to Western standards of business ethics ensures seamless integration into your team.

My experience: Senior Sales Manager in an IT company with a focus primarily on B2B sales. I've worked with big and small companies with 1.5 year of experience in B2B sales. Some of my previous experiences: I was selling building materials in a retail sales, worked as a 5-star hotel administrator. I've studied Hotel Management and Marketing in Poznań, Poland in Academy of Hotel Management and Catering Industry.

"
sales manager,"I successfully passed CAE (Cambridge Advanced English) exam and got approved C1 level. 

I am proud that being a person who started learning English at the age above 20 without decent background and special talents I still managed to hit Advanced level in few years.

Now I am taking pronunciation classes in order to make my English sound as most genuine and enjoyable to listen as possible.

Being a lawyer, I had to deal with different people including the toughest ones like criminals, police detectives, intel agents, judges and some politicians. It was not so easy but I succeeded in doing my job properly. Thanks to my negotiation skills.
My first education was Legal education.
My second education is in the field of Linguistics.

Being a lawyer, I used to work in district Court as a court secretary and in an agricultural company as a lawyer.

I do not have relevant working experience in IT/Sales but I am determined to compensate it with a proper background.

First, I have advanced (C1) level of English. It is proved by my results at Cambridge Advanced English (CAE) exam. I am fluent in all kinds of communication. The same time I am a talkative person and I have a vast experience of communication and cultural exchange with English native speakers on the majority of popular online platforms. Most of the content I consume is in English. 
Tech Sales mostly is about communication with native English speakers and I am here entirely at home.

Second, I have recently finished the IT Sales course at iampm.club. Its program covers the whole sales process from positioning and ICP creating to closing deals. I managed to systematize my knowledge and learn how to perform research, work with different lead generation channels, create personalized emails and social network messages, communicate with clients and use the most popular CRMs and automation tools. 
This preparation cannot substitute real field experience but it is more than enough to make my onboarding as smooth and easy as possible.

Third, I am full of desire to succeed and perform well and I am ready to invest time, effort and money in my development. I usually follow foreign and local sales speakers like John Barrows, Josh Braun, Devin Reed, Aaron Ross, Anton Fedulov, Max Makarenko, Marina Nikitchuk, Taras Altunin, Anastasia Shmal, listen to podcasts, read books, watch videos. I have a list of courses to attend in the near future.
Considering my thirst for knowledge there is always a chance for me to become a unicorn employee.

My last place of work was the company Halo Lab, where I first worked with IT products and held meetings with clients via Google Meet.

"
sales manager,"Building marketing strategies and advertising for a company that is working in a small and very limited market. I didn't have any professional experience in it, and i had to learn the process by completing online courses and reading books because no one was improving our marketing plan before I got here. They realized how important it is, and it created a new position within the company.

My ""out of the box"" mindset helped me in a lot of negotiations, and it was inspiring form the people I was working with.
My professional career is very diverse, but still it was most of the time linked to sales and communication with clients. I prefer to negotiate in person, and meet my clients because my communication skills are my joker. The experience that I got, from selling professional equipment and cars (B2B) to account managing, helped me to improve my soft-skills in different areas and I consider myself as an all-round specialist. “Creative” is the word that is present in all the feedbacks about me. 

I had the chance to improve my knowledge in French due to my personal experiences, as I was living most of the time in French-speaking countries. It made me very flexible, and I feel comfortable in all possible professional situations, no matter how hard the task is or who I’m facing. Working as an account manager in an IT company shows once again this flexibility. Being a law student in France made me literate, and the fact that I got my bachelor shows that I won’t be hesitating in front of difficulties and hard work. My knowledge in French is also a big plus for me that I would love to use while working.
My goal is to work with a quality product that I trust, and like myself. I seek for more responsibilities and some free space for my creativity. It doesn't matter for me how big the project is, unless I'm surrounded by passionate and hardworking people. Working in a company that creates and promotes new software would be a big plus. 

I'm not a fan of cold calls, and Email marketing and I want to avoid it. I prefer working with a small amount of clients at a time, and be more invested in each of them. For me, quality wins over quantity."

The lists were built using BuiltWith technology lookup - to find websites that were using our competitor's technology, in combination with additional tools to estimate the revenue.
Outside of lead generation, my responsibilities included standard negotiations - I was presenting our product while gathering customer requirements, creating and presenting a quote based on the gathered info and contract negotiations. I also did product demos in the beginning, but in the later years, this was no longer practiced.
After 4 years of work, I decided to act out my passion for technology and development and transition into the IT Sales market.
openGeeksLab was my introduction to IT. I worked there for 8 months while learning the . My main responsibilities were Lead Generation (Linkedin cold outreach, cold Email campaigns) as well as negotiations. I also had some practice with UpWork, Angel and Youteam. The company also had an inbound sales funnel through a contact form on the website.
My main tasks were lead qualification, gathering the requirements and discussing the design of the solution (if the prospect did not have one we offered paid services to design the project), tight work with the PM, Design and development department for estimation and offer preparation, offer presentation and contract negotiations. They also included project handover and customer invoicing.
I continued my work in Sales in a small startup outsourcing/outstaffing company ABRIKA, where I was a de-facto head of Sales and Partnerships.
In the first half a year together with the COO, head of PM and Tech Team Lead we iterated on and came up with a scalable Sales Process, that described the sales funnel, points of sales interactions with PM and Tech teams, among other things.
Later I worked on expanding the company's partnership network. This resulted in 4 new closed projects.
I am at my best in negotiations with customers. I am a strong advocate for ethical sales practices, as they provide the best long-term results and return customers."

sales manager,"Lead generation
I’ve done lead generation in 2 ways: automated and manual. From automated, we had 1 lead, that finished ignoring us (our failure in this one depends on several reasons, but the main are: automated list building, without proper analysis → bad copy without almost any personalization). The manual one was better, but also not so great.

Cold Outreach
I’ve made automation for 3 cold outreach campaigns. It was not successful but it’s experience from where I understood that automation in everything is not the key to progress. Emails have to be more personalized! That’s the key! (The service the company is providing is performance marketing)
Also, I have some experience in manual cold outreach on LinkedIn. It was not successful yet. But I am still working on this. I had 5 leads (none of them bought consultation). With 39% reply rate. And 0% deal rate as you can understand

List of prospects creating
I’ve created lists for different companies. 1st is a consulting agency (used Bardeen and scraped inf from UpWork), 2nd is a marketing agency (used LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Apollo). The lists were actually not bad. I’ve segmented prospects by different metrics. ICP was matched perfectly, as the C-level said :-)

Calls
I’ve had only two calls so far.
The first was in English. I was selling consultation to a Pakistani aspiring entrepreneur. It was not really bad, but he didn’t buy it because of the budget.
The second one was in Ukrainian. It was the same service. I was selling logic, but the company doesn’t need to prioritize this lead stream for now, so we agreed to talk about this in October.

experience in personnel selection, training, adaptation, motivation,
the ability to unite the team.
"
sales manager,"
The opportunity to work in a new field seems very exciting to me. As I have previous experience of user account management and sales I can assert that nothing brings you more confidence and inspiration, than customer satisfaction. Because well-nurtured and properly guided customer will get back to you and go along with you on the customer journey again and again.

Of course, to bring the result one must possess the endurance, ability to coordinate the customer performance and organize his portfolio in a most beneficial way for the company. The quarterly/annual goals have to be set properly in a way that the client will demand the growth of its portfolio.

Among the other virtues I got from my experience as an account manager is that perfection has no limits, so you can often attract customers by finding new ways (channels) of selling the products and services for them, thus building the whole strategy which has its objectives, key results and can be measured, diversified and changed betweentimes. 
Another thing, which is absolutely indispensable in building a strong brand is acquiring new customers, finding the channels and marketplaces, where you can engage more relevant audiences, and finding new partners.
Finding new partners (lead generation) in its turn is one of the virtues I developed during my work at Podavach. As one of the platforms to sell and engage new companies into buying our products I used LinkedIn. Another point of sale was Instagram. With several firearm retailers we launched a campaign where we bundled our speedloaders with their customized apparel, vests.
The approach (setting up a proposal) also depended on the level of the customer and its credibility. With Optics Planet, for example, we have not only different price levels, but also the unique customized loader with their brand printing on it.

I'd prefer to work with a larger product company, which already has a Business Development Department. A Sales Manager should focus on calls and the sales pipeline, imho, so a team of Lead Generation Managers is preferred. I'd also rather make calls with clients, and deal with direct communication, because I think I could be more useful in such a role, because of my English-teaching background, language, communication and developed soft-skills."

"
sales manager,"Finally, here are some reasons to choose my candidacy. 
1)	11 years of experience in developing WEB and desktop projects allowed me to:
•	fully work with clients in 1 week, without the need for intellectual investment;
•	negotiate continuously, nullify incompetent answers such as ""I have to consult with our developers to answer your question"", thus confirming to the client both of my competence and the competence of the team.
2)	My work in the field of natural gas sales (B2B) has allowed me to gain successful experience in the untapped market, where customers not only did not form their need, but also do not know about its existence, do not trust the organizations. 
An example of success is my biggest contract, which in March 2019 amounted to about 5 million UAH annually. Contracts were also signed, for medium and small amounts.
3)	My more than two years of experience at the State Industrial Enterprise allowed me to search for and sign the contracts with both new organizations and those who are already partners of the enterprise, to independently decide on the placement of production orders for industrial outsourcing. Thus, I have experience of communication both from the position of a sales manager and from the position of a person who communicates with such managers. So I know exactly what the person I'm talking to wants to hear.
4)	Now I work in the field of IT sales and, combining the above advantages, I feel quite confident.
Working experience:

From 08.2020 to present – VERSTKOVO (Sales manager).
Job responsibilities:
•	building provisional budget, negotiations with potential and regular customers (WEB & Design);

After a year and a half, I took on the additional responsibility of lead retention. This involved staying in touch with projects until our offerings aligned with their specific stages and roadmaps. Furthermore, I recently got a sales position for subsidiary companies, where I continue to utilize my skills and expertise in driving successful sales outcomes.

I'd like to find a workplace that fosters a positive and inclusive culture, enabling me to further develop my skills and contribute to the overall success of the organization.

UpWork agency management
I've prepared the article about COE for Automation in the Banking domain. 
I've adjusted the landings to make them attract at least one new Lead per week.
I would avoid working over the projects based on pure RPA techniques.
Еhe experience
I have over 2.5 years of experience in Sales and marketing in the IT domain.
As a customer engagement manager. The most common type of project was a Marketing Campaign (MC) aimed at the development of any particular technological department of my current company. My responsibility was to uncover new Leads, clarify their Business needs and finally prepare the ground for the Sales Manager and Project Manager's involvement in the negotiations process. Another type of project may be considered as ""Events"" - meetings during the Expos / Summits / Conferences arrangement and support.

Since June 2020 (till now) I've started the role of a Software business consultant (aka Sales manager). The types of projects are the same with the extension of my responsibility up to the Client onboarding and Contract documents preparation/execution.
Regular tasks included: negotiations with potential clients, client onboarding, commercial documents negotiation and execution, MCs initiation/finalization, CRM keeping, management of the Marketing colleagues, content artifacts preparation (landing pages, Case studies, articles, presentations). The types of deals I had closed are both out-stuffing and project-based ones.

My expectations
I would be glad to join a new team of IT professionals and help them to expand their presence in the worldwide IT market. The Softdev, ML/DL/IoT-based projects are the most interesting for me. The domains, where I have got the industrial knowledge are financial/banking, geospatial/navigation/automotive. Any other may be also considered!
I will highly appreciate clear communication with the delivery team and elder colleagues. 
The outsourcing model and the middle-sized companies are preferred. 
Hope to make great friends and reliable partners.
I would prefer a small or middle company, focused on a particular domain. The outsourcing model is obviously more challengeable and yet - it may deliver more. The product model may be interesting to try as well - I have no such experience before and would like to obtain it.
Clear communication with the neighbor departments values very much for me.
A clear perspective of where we can get with the team together matters.
A clear bonus system is very important to me.
I want a meaningful and resultative job, with clear KPIs and open-minded Team-leads."

Hey!

My Name is Artem, and I might be just the Sales you are looking for. ;)

It’s been quite a journey to get to where I am now. Initially, I walked on the Marketing path for several years until I joined my first IT company. It changed everything for me and turned my world upside-down. After a year of my work there, the CEO released the whole Sales department due to low results. During those challenging times, I proposed CEO to take over sales activities while she looked for a replacement. 

It turned out that I not only do well but that I enjoy sales. I realized that Sales is not about pushing somebody to buy from you but more about establishing solid and trustful relationships, and that’s what I’ve been good at it my whole life. 

My career grew to Head of Sales and Marketing, where my sales activities were minimal. Then I realized that my passion stays with Sales and that management and lead generation are not something I want to do now.

During my 4-year sales journey I:
• Worked at Outsource and Product companies
• Got experience in selling Product, Outsource and Outstaff services
• Conducted first calls and walked clients till the start of cooperation and even further
• Closed deals in Blockchain, Education, Wellness, Fintech, IoT, Travel, and other domains
• Negotiated with clients all details of cooperation - rates, cost, timeframe, team, terms, etc
• Worked closely with CRM systems, filling them with all activities and details of communication with clients and using CRM as a task manager.
• Demonstrated to clients company’s services, capabilities, processes, estimates, and tech solutions.
• Built Lead generation and sales flow from scratch and documented everything in Confluence
• Prepared and reviewed contract agreements.
• Sent invoices and collected payments from clients
• Worked closely with the tech department to come up with the best solution for the client in terms of needs, goals, budget, and timeframe 

With a solid marketing background and four-year experience in Sales, I understand how to define clients' needs and goals effectively, close deals, upsell and build trustful relationships with clients. 

I love exploring everything new and I never stop enhancing my personal and sales skills.

Let’s talk! :)
Now I'm looking for a place where I can unleash my potential and use my negotiation skills to close good deals for the company for a long time."

sales manager,"My first deal was the biggest deal in company: 7 outstuff devs for one company

My first closed deal started with a request for one dedicated developer, which then quickly transformed into 5 + 2 team.

sales manager,"Built the Sales & Recruitment Departments for a Cloud native company from scratch.
I finished the Lead Generation Course in my city's company. And was hired as a Lead Generation Specialist. I quickly understood how IT companies work, especially their sales departments and their key goals. Learned how to set a multi-stage lead generation through LinkedIn, Email marketing, Upwork, Clutch, and Twitter. I also confidently maintain a profile on Upwork and Clutch and find new potential customers. Then I understand that I have faced a wall where my opportunities for self-development and contribution to the company are limited.

Then a new stage in my life began with the Cloud native company.

I’m not afraid of this word as a pioneer: since the company has been successfully working on the market for 4 years, but without a sales department.

Also, as you may have guessed, my main task was to build a lead generation and sales department from scratch. But unfortunately now, in times of political instability, like many businesses, this company is going through hard times.

So I'm open and hungry for new challenges!

- Have built and still maintain the Sales Department from scratch;
- Set up all workflow and wrote all documentation;
- Tested and implemented the best channels of modern lead generation and negotiation process;
- Found and grew up two new teammates for us (like a Lead Generation Specialists / Talent Searcher)
- I also get valuable experience in Account Managing
- Also, I've done all these things for the Recruitment Department

sales manager,"I definitely have a lot of achievement in all my sales life from forex, to hardware sales and even in support.
Just one of my achievements in IT industry.I closed a deal of hardware implementation in warehouse and project, was with a US company (Collisionworks.com). Their use case was indoor navigation (Bluetooth real time Location system (RTLS) and Ultra wide Band RTLS ). The contract and project deal was enormous.

    The Tax free project which I had the occasion to participate.Was a startup projects that are still running till now in Europe. Tax free for you still facilitates and help many tourist to get back their taxes in a speedy way.You can find many of this tax machines in many  of the European touristic areas.
  
Bank for you as one of a project that I worked with to facilitate  students to open a bank account (visa or pre-paid master cards) in their non residential area.   

International financial markets precisely in Forex and was Cysec legal. In which most of our companies that operate here in Ukraine are not regulated nor certified?, Thus this type of companies are protected by the businessman or corrupted government representatives. I pitched a client who opened  a trading account of 1000000$.
As an experienced Sale Manager,Team Leader, L1, Customers support, Word,excel, outlook, Security & monitoring, Safety, Business Development.
     I started working as an agent in 2010, in a call centers in Kiev. Both in the inbound & outbound fields, reaching out to different clients from B2B,B2C,C2C .This involved both outsourcing and insourcing activities. Calling or receiving calls with both hot leads and cold calls activities.
     I always do my best and would like companies to treat their workers as people (the missing puzzle)  and not like some piece of sheet that can be changed tomorrow.A company must provide good leads or a good database for its own benefits.
     Plant a tree and you will bear fruits.The governments must work for the people and power to the people. Any industry or company must invest(time,money,trainings) in their workers in order to achieve or bear this success together.
I am expecting a type of work that will give me more experience, techniques, trainings, eduction , webinours and will use all my abilities and scales, to give me a feeling of accomplishment and the anxiety to come to work every day with a wonderful smile.
Security in my working  area or environment should be stable and having a job that provides a steady employment. But not blackmailing and stressing environmental.
Working for a company that has a good reputation that makes me proud of working for them.
Promotions and growth. Being able to progress in one's job or career or having the chance to advance in a company. It gives wings and increases my vision spectrum in an environment. Rather than stagnating and decaying in one spot or environment.
The sallary should be paid at least enough to meet one's needs, and being paid fairly in comparison to others.
The managment or supervision should have an immediate supervisor who is competent, considerate, and fair. Or I should be promoted to this functions.
Having working hours that allow one enough time with family or time to pursue other strong interests and live one's preferred lifestyle.
Benefits and bonus are essential for my eyes to always shine and hence will make me try more than I can.
Working Conditions have to be physical working conditions that are safe, not injurious to health, not stressful, and even comfortable. The working conditions have to fit all the governments labour terms and conditions."

Sales is my passion and I truly love facing new challenges. My persistence and self-devotion always help me achieving goals. 

Previously, I've gone through a path from a Junior Sales Manager to a Head of Sales Department of a digital agency. 

My responsibilities were: 
- Manage a team of 10
- Identifying key areas for improvement in the sales process
- Attending industry events and conferences to generate new business leads
- Networking with C-Level in business trips in order to generate new business for the company
- Research the pools of ICP in professional networks (LinkedIn, Xing, Angelist, Clutch.co) and other platforms (Upwork, Freelancer) within focus markets, industries
- Initiate the first contact with leads and closing new business
- Developing a business development strategy focused on financial gain, including cold-emailing, face-to-face meetings, roadshows, networking, etc.

I decided to step down from a management position to focus on developing my personal sales skills and enlarge my expertise areas in IT. 

After that, I've worked as a Senior Account Executive in a product and services IT company. My responsibilities were:
- Work with senior leadership to set business unit strategy, develop tactical sales plans, and report regularly on progress toward the goal
- Conduct strategies to identify, pursue, and win new business opportunities
- Meeting with leads/clients: Intro calls, Proposal creation, and all related sales and pre-sales activities.

Domain Knowledge: 
SaaS | Enterprise Software | Financial Services | Insurance Tech | Appex Apps | Salesforce | Dynamics 365 | Native and Cross-platform Mobile Apps | .NET | Java | JS |

I enjoy selling complex products, solutions, and dedicated IT teams.

I really love the communication process, and thanks to my empathy level, I'm good at it.
I would love to join a company with :
- clear sales processes and a supportive Pre-Sale team
- established lead flow 
- business trips 
- the ability to learn from the leaders, polish my skills, and become an even better sky-rocket closer
As I expect to sell projects with >500k+ budgets.

I DON'T want to be responsible for generating new prospects: I love spending time on a phone with relevant leads, rather than cold-emailing on UpWork/Linkedin or cold-calling. 

I love to participate in requirements elicitation and proposal creation activities.
