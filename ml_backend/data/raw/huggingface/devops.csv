I am an experienced Network and Cloud and DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience in the IT infrastructure and Internet Service Provider (ISP) area. I have also participated in planning, designing, and building some of Large IT infrastructure projects.

Certified Cloud Developer: AWS, completed the following projects.
Section I: Cloud Fundamentals
Project1: Deploy static website on AWS
In this project, I have created a public S3 bucket and uploaded the static website files to the bucket, configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using IAM policies, enabled CORS policy, and speed up content delivery using AWS’s CDN service, CloudFront. The website was accessible via the s3 endpoint or CloudFront domain name or the website–endpoint publicly

Project2: Udagram: Your Own Instagram on AWS
Here in this project, I have developed a cloud-based application for uploading, listing, and filtering images. I have used Node.js (Express w /Typescript), a popular JavaScript framework for networked application development. I have implemented a REST API to issue commands using HTTP, store data in Amazon Web Services Relational Data Service (RDS) and S3, extend the codebase with secure authentication sign-on features, and deploy to Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk via EB CLI.

Project3: Refactor Monolith to Microservices and Deploy
In this project, I have taken an existing application called Udagram (Instagram-like App)  and refactored it into a microservice architecture with two backend services one reverse proxy and one frontend/client services. All(4) microservices are dockerized and all docker images are pushed to the DockerHub using Travis CI Pipeline. Then, all docker images were deployed to the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes services (EKS) cluster.

Project4: Develop and Deploy a Serverless App
Lastly, this project tasked me to develop an Instagram-like Toddo Application using AWS Lambda and a serverless framework for uploading, listing, and filtering images. The frontend/client side was built by ReactJS and Auth0 has been used for user Authentication and Authorization. For the backend part, I have built serverless REST APIs using API Gateway and AWS Lambda, a stack of serverless technologies on AWS.  All user data has been stored in AWS DynamoDB and S3.
AWS Services covered: EC2, EBS, VPC, Elastic Beanstalk(EB), Lambda, S3(Inc. Glacier), DynampDB, RDS(MYSQL), RedShift, CloudFront, AWS Shield, IAM, Route53, EC2 Auto-scaling, ELB,  API Gateway, NodeJs

Hey!
Great to see you at my profile.
I guess you are looking for someone to get work done, troubleshoot issues and build robust and scalable solutions?. So here I am : an engineer who has been working in the systems engineering field for the last 6 years, encompassing a wide range of technologies and tools.
To give you a better understanding of me as an engineer let me walk you through my experience. 
I'm coming from a systems/networking background, working as a classic system administrator for the first year of my career, then gradually switching towards infra engineering and clouds, the stuff I've been working with ever since.
A couple of my latest gigs:
1) A large AWS infra for a global industry leader. The main focus was on migrating a legacy AWS Beanstalk infra to a new shiny ECS(giving a shot to k8s along the way), going from VMs to containers, from Ansible to Terraform, etc-etc.
2) Supporting and improving an automation platform for ~20 datacenters across the globe, from a personal page buttons clicking to raw SNMP commands sent to the switches. Not the most perfect/up-to-date stack but quite an interesting product itself.
So, what do I bring to the table?
Deep Linux and networking knowledge, hands-on experience with AWS, all the stuff related to web operations, monitoring&logging. I also can write code in python/php though I'm not a programmer by trade.
On a personal side: down to earth person who is willing to help, proactive and patient. I've worked in both distributed and local office teams.
But enough about me.
What do I expect from you ? 
0) No legacy. Or at least there is a planned migration. PHP5.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't sound sexy at all. 
1) Remote job. I really would love to gather once in a while for a beer to get to know colleagues better, but I wholeheartedly despise traffic and stuffy openspaces.
2) You have a roadmap for the 1-3-6 months. Or at least you want me to help to build it together. I'm not after pivoting every other month, sorry.
3) You're working on your technical debt, not simply piling up a backlog. Usually that stuff bites you in the ass around 03:00 AM. Decent sleep - good working mood.
It's been quite a big text and unfortunately there is no TL;DR.
Feels like we are sharing common values and it could be beneficial working together? Definitely hit me up with a short description about the project and let's see how we can make it work.
Thank you for your time and have a good one!
Remote or 3/2 office work.
Certainly looking for a team/company with well-built processes.
Product companies are preferred but it's not a dealbraker."

I have 17 years of customer support experience supporting large and enterprise class customers using a variety of ticketing systems such as custom vertical systems, Fogbugz, and Jira. From my most recent position I have 10 years of operations and customer support leadership experience in IT where I worked with MS SQL, Windows Server, VPNs, RDP, testing software for bug fixes, and other duties as assigned for projects. In the last 7 of those ten years that experience also included Microsoft Azure using app insights, logs, and other metrics to monitor web app resources and resolve any issues or creating bug reports for software developers to investigate further. I also managed Azure AD, Office365, cloud and onprem Windows and Linux VMs, Ubiquity network equipment and VPNs. We used a variety of tools such as New Relic, Azure alerts, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Uptime Robot, and were just implementing Datadog at the time of my departure from this position. 
Prior to these experiences I also have experience working as a network security engineer working with Cisco networking equipment and performing security audits in the medical and financial institutions markets. We also used a combination of monitoring tools such as Nagios and Solarwinds.

A year ago, my knowledge was limited to basic networking. Fast forward to today, I've delved into the TCP stack, dabbled in traffic analysis, and acquired foundational skills in Linux networking. I've also played around with Python and bash scripting. I have a good understanding of how containerization and cloud environments work. Plus, I've gained hands-on experience with AWS, particularly services like EC2, IAM, and S3. Quite the tech adventure, huh? Now, I'm exploring even deeper waters as a DevOps trainee at EPAM. Beyond tech, I'm all about mountains and nature, cherish great conversations, am into sports, and every so often, I love to sprinkle in a joke.
I'm looking for my first job in the DevOps field. Over the past year, I've gained a lot of knowledge, and I'm eager to put it to use. I want to see how everything I've learned can help in a real work setting. Getting a DevOps position and applying my skills is my main goal for the upcoming year. It's an exciting next step for me!"

Hi.
I'm a certified AWS DevOps Engineer.

AWS Cloud Practitioner.

I have experience building and supporting AWS infrastructure with Terraform, Terraform workspace, and Terragrunt.

I have a lot of experience in working with different CI/CD tools, for example, I worked a lot with GitLab CI,  I can very quickly organize the automation of the necessary processes, both build projects and deployment, as well as other issues related to application containerization. I can also do similar things in GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines, Jenkins (I also have a lot of experience with Jenkins, creating infrastructure (using terraform), automating various tasks, creating database backups, etc.)

I can write scripts in Python or Bash to create backups and use CI/CD tools to automate such tasks. I also have a lot of experience with databases and their backup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RDS, Redis, etc).

I have worked a lot with monitoring and logging systems, I have a lot of experience with Prometheus and Grafana, ElasticSearch and Kibana as well as DataDog.

I have good knowledge of Linux systems, and IaC tools, such as Terraform and Ansible.
I worked with containerization (Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes) and orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker swarm, EKS, ECS).

I had many different projects, both part-time and full-time positions. On one of the latest projects, I successfully organized the infrastructure in the AWS cloud using terraform and terraform workspaces (AWS EKS, AWS ECR, AWS EC2, and other AWS services). I also successfully created all CI-CD processes in Jenkins. As for containerization and orchestration, I successfully created and maintained a cluster, and organized autoscaling of nodes and pods in it for infrastructure flexibility. I also worked with service mesh tools (Istio) and made a canary deployment for applications using Jenkins.

I prefer projects from scratch, where there is a need to set up everything from the ground up, but will consider other opportunities too.

I have experience setting up best-practice AWS multi-account structure using Terraform and Terraform Cloud, implementing CI/CD processes using Gitlab/Github with ArgoCD, and kustomize, with Prometheus/ELK.

Using ArgoCD/kustomize/Crossplane, I will also be able to offer an implementation of preview/dynamic environments and their integration into the CI process.

Core skills:
- AWS: multi-account structure (AWS Org, SSO, TransitGateway), security and auditing (SecurityHub, GuardDuty, AWS Config), EKS, RDS, S3, etc
- IaC: Crossplane, Terraform, Terraform Cloud, Cloudformation
- GitOps: ArgoCD, Kustomize, FluxCD, Helm
- CI/CD: Gitlab, Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Scripting: Groovy, Python

The most relevant DevOps projects:

1. Event-driven malware scanning app. As a single DevOps engineer, I took over all of the DevOps activities from the previous contractors, migrated the platform to a new architecture, and implemented an ArgoCD-based CI/CD process in Gitlab with fully automated preview environments.

Tools: AWS, Crossplane, terraform, Gitlab, ArgoCD, Kustomize, RMQ, Prom/ELK, Twingate.

2. Healthcare web app. As a single DevOps engineer, I was planning and implementing all of the DevOps activities from scratch. Creating a multi-account AWS Org structure fully automated using terraform and Terraform Cloud and implementing CI/CD process using Gitlab and ArgoCD.

Tools: Terraform Cloud, AWS Organizations, AWS SSO, AWS Transit Gateway, EKS, Gitlab, Kustomize, ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, Loki/Prom stack, etc.

3. Blockchain lending app. As a single DevOps engineer, I was working on the creation of a new multi-account AWS platform from scratch.

Tools: Terraform Cloud, Sentinel, AWS Organizations, GitHub Actions.

4. Fintech project. Being a part of a small DevSecOps team with a primary focus on resolving any security-related issues as well as improving and automating internal processes.

Tools: AWS, EKS, Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, GitLab, Helm, FluxCD, SecurityHub, GuardDuty, AWS Config.

5. Data analytics platform. My main responsibilities were managing Jenkins, and implementing CI/CD processes using blue/green deployments for serverless AWS apps.

Tools: AWS, Lambdas, API Gateways, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Jenkins, Sonarqube, GitLab, Groovy, Python.

Key DevOps engineer at EPAM Systems, working on London Stock Exchange Group customer.  The project responsible for migration of the middle-size Java/Python based search engine application to the AWS cloud with implementation of microservice approaches.

Technology stack: AWS, Jenkins, GitlabCI, Terraform, Datadog, k8s, Helm, ElasticSearch
Programming languages: bash, groovy, python.

Main achievements: 
•	Developed the architecture for the solution in cloud for the migration of application from on-premises to AWS Cloud using Application Refactoring:App Modernization migration strategy. As a result project costs were reduced by 40% by using Autoscaling groups/Spot instances/AWS-managed services. 
•	Implemented IaC approach for dynamic infrastructure deployment by Terraform from scratch.
•	Developed full CICD lifecycle and replaced all  legacy scripts with automated pipelines. Two platforms were used due to customer requirements:
- GitlabCI – reworked existing CI process, adjusted it for microservice-based                         architecture
 - Jenkins – created CD process which allows to dynamically deploy all underlying AWS infrastructure with single job. Application components are deployed using Helm as a main platform for provisioning k8s objects using templates, it helped to keep all application-related code in one place and reduced overall amount of deployment scripts to a few helm charts and sing job.
As a result Full Deploy time was reduced from 400 to 130 minutes.
•	Simplified existing monitoring solution by replacing old multi-language on-premise (monitoring/alarming/log-publishing) scripts with container-native Kubernetes sidecar-containers/jobs, that helped to simplify overall projects infrastructure(complexity) and allowed to have all auxiliary monitoring components deployed in one place with single job.
•	Mentoring the team of two DevOps (Middle and Junior) engineers in order to achieve client’s delivery deadlines.

Overall experience - 3 years

As a low code developer on the Bubble.io platform, I was responsible for all aspects of the applications development: implementing workflows, calculations, integrating with other apps, data modeling, building UI, configuring access, versioning, and deployment. In my free time from low code projects, I actively developed as a DevOps engineer with the help of my mentor, learning some of the AWS cloud computing services, IAAS, configuration management, virtualization, CI/CD, monitoring tools, and Bash scripting. I am also familiar with containerization and have some experience with Kubernetes. As a practical consolidation, I performed several tasks on different projects including building CI/CD pipelines and troubleshooting.

My primary responsibilities included developing and customizing stages, processes, and steps, integrating Pega applications with external systems, creating web services, modifying data sources, decision tables, and activities. I was also configuring UI portals, sections, and widgets for various groups of users and managers to show them particular data.
I also had experience as a DevOps engineer, responsible for configuring and maintaining roles, access groups and privileges for the development team, management and end-users, implementing CI/CD pipelines on AWS-based Pega cloud and monitoring cloud metrics to ensure smooth operations.

As a developer, I was responsible for developing and upgrading the backend Java code and related functionality, updating web pages and navigation tools to meet the clients needs and improve usability, maintaining the database, working on query and function optimization, preparing update releases, and monitoring logs

optimize time. For me, being a DevOps is a
professional growth, it is an opportunity to
optimize the time spent by the customer and
the team on creating something new,
something incredible. I am constantly

 Practical and later, scientific work in the field of automation of commissioning works for large strategic global systems, where much attention was paid to complexity and ensuring resilience.
 Commissioning works in banking institutions.
 Commissioning and operational works to ensure inter-organizational interaction systems at the third level of technical support.

    :
 Consulting owners, TOP management, and DevOps leadership on improving the efficiency of managing the DevOps service to enhance the resilience of the organization's information system.
 Designing CI/CD systems with the provision of all necessary documentation (followed by certification).
 In subsequent stages, consulting DevOps clients on the third line of technical support.
Certification services to determine the quality of DevOps.

The value of such innovation for your IT consulting business:
 You ALREADY have a market presence, and have DevOps staff - practically reuse, repeat sales.
Minimal costs for testing a business hypothesis, for deployment, as there are trained staff, accumulated experience, market knowledge, and trusted clients.
 This is an expansion of their market offer only in a more expensive market package, as the margin of consulting services has always been high. Experts already note activity in the IT consulting market segment and its high margin.

devops,"Afirix.eu - cloud engineer
Hired to work (project-based) for Pan-net to de-clutter all activity between the Support department and DevOps so by using Python and Bash I've automated the live migration of 4000+ VMs from old OpenStack version to the current stable one. This was considered a breakthrough which accelerated our project delivery by 5 months before the deadline. 1 week solving L2&L3 tickets, 1 week pipeline governor (debugging failed pipelines by creating, managing Docker images and maintain dev and test sites updated), 2 weeks solving a chosen task (like node hardware and software recovery tests).  Here, I realized I was already a DevOps guys. 

DigiSign.ro - PKI system admin
Using VMware ESXi I've turned our in-house data center into our own intranet, acquired a video AI startup that would self-generate certificates (e-mail signatures, doc signatures) and I've set set the foundation for it on AWS (configured the entire video AI solution on AWS).

Satoga S.R.L. - System admin
I've designed, built and configured from scratch (pulling cables, configuring racks, servers, storage, APIs) entire infrastructures for the finance sector (ANAF, Banca Transilvania, Piraeus Bank), tourism (hotels and agencies) using XenServer and XCP-NG, Windows server 2012 R2 - 2016.

ServerRoom.net - Technical support manager
I've started as technical support operator for web hosting (cPanel, Plesk, ISPConfig, web servers, web sites, PHP, MySQL) services and Wowza streaming services (based on CentOS and Ubuntu servers). After 4 months, I've challenged the back-then technical support team leader at a hackathon and became the technical team leader - took over his 7-members team, created a customer-oriented culture driven by the satisfaction of helping others.

devops,"Supported revenue management team during the database split-up from the parent company. Assisted the developers with data import using SQL*Loader, Unix power tools and bash. Further optimized recalculation routines with the usage of table compression, partition elimination technique, SQL optimization and changing data/process flow. Reduced execution to 2-5 times for different routines.

Volunteered to work on CID NaUKMA / INFOPULSE e-democracy pro-bono project. The project provided platform to test and implement various e-dem instruments proposed by CID NaUKMA and later allowed the creation of petition.president.gov.ua.

Performed PoC to make sure that we are able to handle all Oracle-database associated activities that we normally do for our customers and proved that we are ready to move to AWS when needed. The PoC included the creation of the necessary infrastructure to operate Oracle databases and followed best practices for Oracle published by AWS.

Implemented complex database solution using Data Guard and Flashback technologies when during the day the database is open and is used for reporting purposes and during the night it is a standby database and applies changes, cycling between these states. Worth noting that the whole solution was plugged to the monitoring.

Pinpointed hot parts of 15 TB OSS database using AWR reports and placed them on the high performance storage while keeping the rest of the database on cheap storage reducing the costs and still allowing for acceptable performance (ratio of 1:100 achieved).

As DevOps proposed to contribute to the other team's Helm chart instead of forking the project and collaborate the efforts. Effectively pulled the chart in a month to a level acceptable for inclusion to umbrella. Have been supporting the chart for over half a year adopting the changes for network policies, high availability control and load balancer services including IPv6 compliance.

Unable to settle for contribution model forked the chart of PostgreSQL from another team and changed it to have Patroni standby cluster support. After that as part of a team and personally responsible for PostgreSQL/Patroni developed in-house disaster recovery solution for a product using primarily Ansible playbooks.

Bank Of Georgia, DevOps Engineer (10.12.2019 - Present):

In my role as a DevOps Engineer at Bank Of Georgia, I have been responsible for enhancing the development and release processes through automation and effective version control. I have maintained Git workflows to ensure smooth source code management. I utilized tools like Jenkins and GitLab to automate various stages of the development and release cycles, streamlining the overall workflow.

One of my key contributions has been in working with Docker as a containerization platform. I have experience in deploying applications within Docker containers, which has helped in achieving consistency across different environments and simplifying the deployment process. Additionally, I've orchestrated Docker container clusters using Kubernetes, ensuring efficient management and scalability of containerized applications.

Monitoring and maintaining the health and performance of services have been crucial aspects of my role. I have worked with monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of the system's metrics and promptly address any issues that arise. Investigating and resolving technical problems has been a routine part of my responsibilities, contributing to the overall stability and reliability of the systems.

Liberty Bank, IT Application Administrator (17.05.2019 - 07.12.2019):

During my tenure at Liberty Bank, I held the position of IT Application Administrator. In this role, I played a significant role in deploying application code changes, collaborating closely with application vendors and internal developers. I effectively utilized Jenkins for seamless code deployment, ensuring that updates were integrated smoothly into the existing systems.

A major focus of my responsibilities was troubleshooting and maintaining multi-tier applications. I took charge of configuring and fine-tuning these applications, ensuring they operated efficiently. Identifying and addressing environmental and performance issues were part of my routine tasks, guaranteeing that the applications met required standards and performance benchmarks.

Collaborating with third-party software vendors was also an integral part of my role. I engaged with these vendors to resolve any issues that emerged, facilitating smooth interactions between vendors and the organization to ensure the software ecosystem remained stable and functional.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

One of my notable achievements was implementing CI/CD pipelines for a complex microservices-based application. By automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, we reduced deployment times, resulting in a significant increase in release frequency and improved software reliability.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

I am well-versed in Infrastructure as Code practices, using tools like Terraform and Ansible to provision and manage infrastructure. This approach not only enhances scalability but also ensures that infrastructure is versioned, reproducible, and resilient.

Containerization and Orchestration:

Docker and Kubernetes (Openshift) have been integral parts of my toolkit. I've containerized applications, orchestrated clusters, and optimized resource utilization to achieve high availability and scalability, all while maintaining service reliability.

Monitoring and Alerting:

My expertise in setting up monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana and Dynatrace has been instrumental in proactively identifying and mitigating issues. Implementing automated alerting systems has allowed for rapid response to incidents, minimizing downtime.

Security and Compliance:

Security is paramount in DevOps, and I have focused on integrating security best practices into every stage of the development and deployment process. My experience includes vulnerability scanning, access controls, and compliance checks.

Logging with Elasticsearch and Kibana:

I have extensive experience in setting up and managing logging solutions using Elasticsearch and Kibana (ELK stack). This includes collecting and centralizing log data from various sources, creating custom dashboards for real-time visibility, and performing log analysis to detect anomalies and troubleshoot issues effectively.

devops,"One of my many accomplishments revolves around simplifying user creation processes using Lambda functions. Through a carefully crafted workflow, user accounts with needed rights are now generated effortlessly in PostgreSQL databases with expiration process . All of this is driven by Jira ticket requests, Slack and Jenkins pipelines. It’s allowing teams to focus on more strategic endeavours and for DevOps team it’s allow have be more security controls over it

Also I’ve crafted solution having streamlined Paid Time Off (PTO) requests through Slack. By integrating Lambda functions, Slack APIs, and calendar APIs, requesting time off has been easier. Colleagues can now simply use menus after typing command, in Slack and be notified about results of PTO requests, which team leads response. Behind the scenes, Python algorithm in Lambda function and with created Slack Bot ensure these requests are efficiently integrated into company calendars, enhancing collaboration and reducing administrative burden.

My contribution to automating continuous delivery processes through Bitbucket Pipelines has significantly enhanced our development workflow. With this approach, developers experience a frictionless journey from code to deployment. Bitbucket Pipelines seamlessly builds and pushes code images to the open-source image repository, Harbor. The process continues with Portainer and Jenkins orchestrating the deployment of these images to the targeted environments. This transformative automation ensures our teams remain agile and innovative.
Dedicated and driven individual with a strong work ethic, known for attention to detail and a results-driven mindset. Valued for being adaptable, open to change, and possessing a keen analytical acumen. Enthusiastic about technology and deeply committed to my profession, which goes beyond being just a job.

I have had the privilege of working as a DevOps Engineer, focusing on the following key areas:
- Proficient in Linux: Successfully handled the installation and administration of Linux-based network systems, and automated administrative tasks using Bash and Python scripts.
- Proficient in utilizing best practices with open-source and enterprise tools such as Docker (including Docker-Compose), Portainer, Jenkins, Bitbucket (including Bitbucket Pipelines), GitHub, among others.
- Adept with Infrastructure as Code tools, particularly Terraform for AWS.
- Strong command of AWS services such as EC2, VPC, LoadBalancer, Security Hub, Security Manager, Lambda functions… .
- Robust knowledge of Jira, including expertise in Jira automations, streamlining processes and enhancing team efficiency.
- Furthermore, I possess advanced capabilities in writing Slack apps and utilizing Slack for automation processes within the company. This includes creating seamless workflows for tasks with effective algorithms, like urgent production log monitoring, ensuring quick response times. 

My strengths lie in critical thinking and the ability to excel both independently and in dynamic team environments. I believe in creating efficient solutions that drive productivity and innovation.

"
devops,"* Certified AWS Solution Architect (AWS Certified SAA), Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)
* Reduced infra costs by 40% after the first month on a project
* Implemented GitOps approach to deploy 50 apps
* Migrated high-load service from ECS to EKS without any downtime for a web application.
* Migrated about 15 apps from Heroku to AWS EKS.  
* Organized secure way of collecting logs (ELK stack) from different VPCs and Heroku.
* Organized monitoring and alerting based on Prometheus/Alertmanager + several exporters, created Grafana dashboards for main metrics.
* Organized the easiest way of migration of about 100 types of application workers (background workers) from EC2 (Cloudformation + ASG) into Kubernetes (EKS). Prepared helm chart, helmfile configuration, deployment process. The helm chart covers base functionality (replicas count, resources, container command, environment variables, node types (on-demand or spot)) and additional functionality as autoscaling (based on any prometheus queries) and prometheus alerting rules. As a result, dev teams have a tool to migrate from EC2 to EKS very quickly with several advantages.
* Organized scalable, cost-effective CI/CD system using Jenkins and its k8s plugin (with different node types + spot instances). Jenkins configuration stored as a code in a repo to have the possibility to run a whole system from scratch at any time.
* Organized central storage for environment variables (sensitive and not) based on AWS Secrets Manager. It's used to provide environment variables for applications in  Kubernetes clusters
* Deployed service-mesh to resolve an issue with proper balancing GRPC requests (from public network and inside k8s cluster).
* Implemented blue-green deployment using Istio.
* One of the main contributors in a project github.com -> maddevsio/aws-eks-base
* Moved project from Teamcity to Jenkins
* Implemented CD (Continuous delivery) process into 15 environments, using Jenkins’ Active choice plugin.  
* Deployed projects on GCP from zero using Terraform, Kubernetes (GKE), Helm, Gitlab CI/CD.
* Organized monitoring (Prometheus (service discovery) + Grafana) of applications deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* Reduced project deployment time from 2 hours to 20 minutes, unified a pipeline that does not require changes when deploying a new environment.
* Designing and developing infrastructure architecture based on TOP-3 cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* Cloud infrastructure cost optimizing (Reserved instances/Spot instances/preemptible nodes; Autoscaling (by schedule/based on workload/etc; Get rid of Multi-AZ traffic for dev/test envs)
* Developing scalable, high-available, secure cloud infrastructure using best practices (AWS Well-Architected Framework)
* Migrating from on-premise infrastructure or from one cloud to another
* Adherent of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach (Terraform,  Ansible)
* Administration of managed Kubernetes clusters, considering nuances and features of their work in clouds (EKS, GKE, AKS)
* Preparing and migrating applications into Kubernetes cluster
* Using scripting languages to automate routine tasks (Bash, Python)
* Organizing and deploying central logging/monitoring systems (Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, ELK, Loki)
* Great experience with different CI/CD systems (Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Teamcity, Github Actions, Travis CI, Circle CI) and building complex pipelines (blue-green deployment, canary deployment, pipelines with lots of different conditions and steps)
* Experience with GitOps based on ArgoCD
* Great experience with virtualization and containerization
* Conduction infrastructure audits (security, costs, performance)
* Experience with Istio service mesh. Deployed Istio to solve next problems (mTLS between applications, whitelist for http/https hosts of egress traffic, balancing GRPC requests, blue-green deployment)

Over time I played multiple roles like that of an IT operations engineer and Scrum master and then gradually switched to DevOps to implement its practices within the second largest provider of general insurance services in Scandinavia. For me, it’s been a long and winding journey to becoming what is called a DevOps engineer. The journey was unplanned, and for each step, I had to figure out what I want my next challenge to be and how to achieve it. For me, being a DevOps engineer is working on a wide variety of tasks with a wide variety of technologies and tools. It’s understanding the bigger picture and being able to investigate issues efficiently, which makes me want to search for new opportunities that will keep me engaged and challenged.

No obligatory team-building or ""fun"" activities."
devops,"The Creation of the ""All-in-One"" (AiO) Cloud.

The AiO is a shrunken-down fully functional cloud that could fit on your laptop, and hence all our engineers and developers were able to get a running cloud on a relatively small-sized virtual machine. The need to create that came from a very nasty problem that we faced; Since a cloud required heavy resources, our testing clouds had multiple engineers developing, automating, and testing at any one time, and therefore interfered with one another and slowed down the development cycles. After getting the cloud resource requirements down to one server of 8 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs, and 60 GB storage, not only were all employees able to own a cloud, but creating snapshots of the AiO allowed for lightning fast redeployments when things break. When testing goes wrong and too much time is wasted bringing it back up, the ability to just destroy and recreate the environment within seconds proved extremely useful. Of course, the AiO also raised business value in other ways. For example, prospects that had a vision of deploying tens, or even hundreds, of little cloud locations for their use cases now became possible. The All-in-One cloud (AiO) accelerated the growth and business value of the company.
DevOps Engineer from a software development background with 3 years experience in system administration and automation. 

My most recent experience includes:

∞ Worked in a team to tackle virtually any engineering problem related to deploying, managing and maintaining containerized OpenStack-based clouds for clients, while automating all solutions possible. 

∞ Solely architected, constructed, tested and automated miniature version of cloud called “All-In-One"" for the purpose of each developer having their own personal cloud for development and testing. As cloud deployments required large computing resources, the goal was to shrink it down to a point where it is feasible for each developer to have their own. This is to solve a major problem of development and test interference resulting from numerous developers testing on the same test cloud at the same time. 

∞ Integrated and updated new services developed by opensource community, like Karbor (Disaster Recovery As A Service), Freezer (Backup As A Service) and Sahara (Data Processing As A Service) among other cloud services. 

∞ Managed and troubleshooted existing cloud services including Ceph storage clusters 

∞ Developed deployments and update scripts for different cloud components 

∞ Supported with highest technical tier on-call with 2 other members, expected to tackle any type of production problem.

∞ Participated in pre-sales meetings to pinpoint areas of overlap in objectives and matching of verticals with prospects to communicate business value of using our cloud platform and assist in closing the sales.

∞ Presented ideas and lead workshops to team members and other teams.

During my work experience, I have held various positions and worked on diverse projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field of DevOps engineering and system engineering.

As a Senior DevOps Engineer at 2P (Perfect Presentation), my responsibilities included managing the software development lifecycle, implementing automation and continuous delivery pipelines, and bridging the gap between development and operations teams. I worked closely with developers, testers, and system administrators, utilizing DevOps tools such as Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Git, and Docker. Currently, I am working on the MOJ project at Azure DevOps, where I am implementing a continuous delivery pipeline for mission-critical applications.

In my previous role as a DevOps Engineer and Senior System Engineer at IST Networks, I focused on using open-source tools such as Linux, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Zabbix. I automated and improved development and release processes, tested and examined code, ensured system security, and participated in project management decisions. I also accomplished tasks such as Dockerizing products, automating the deployment of PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and enhancing data stability and availability.

As an Implementation Engineer at Knowledge-Net, I installed, configured, and resolved technical issues related to the WatheeqEdge system. I provided technical support, worked closely with development and project management resources, and executed investigative operations. I also successfully completed projects for clients such as Credit Suisse Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, and BAJ (Bank Aljazira).

As a System Engineer at FlairsTech International, I focused on installing, configuring, and maintaining operating systems, managing cloud systems (AWS and OpenStack), configuring VOIP and firewall systems, and implementing monitoring systems like Zabbix. I also worked with Odoo ERP and various databases.

In my role as a System Admin with SQL proficiency at Al-Ahly Momkn for E-Payment in Egypt, I ensured the security and efficiency of the IT infrastructure, managed server OS installations, responded to help desk requests, and performed system monitoring and troubleshooting. I also worked with technologies like Zabbix, PFsense, and SQL databases.

Currently, I am seeking to further improve my skills and knowledge in the field of DevOps engineering and system engineering. I aim to enhance my expertise in using cutting-edge tools and technologies.

Educational project in SoftServe IT-Academy: 
  Full-automated creation & configuration of infrastructure for CI/CD of Sentry on GCP with Terraform and Ansible. 
  Infrastructure:
1.	Gitlab
2.	Jenkins
3.	Sentry (error-handling tool)
4.	Simple web-app on Flask
5.	Monitoring on Stackdriver
We use self-hosted Gitlab as VCS and Jenkins as CI/CD tool. CI/CD process starts after push in Sentry’s repo on Gitlab. Flask web-app is assigned to our Sentry to check its correct work, so after deployment it tracks errors in web-app and sends notification via telegram if catches them. We monitor components of Gitlab and Sentry with Stackdriver, also there are configured health-checks for Flask-app and Jenkins. For each component of our infrastructure, we have configured alerts by Stackdriver and when they are triggered, reports are sent to an email.
I am planning to continue to self-develop in DevOps direction, because I’m really interested in such things as configuration management, IaC and containerization. I can learn relevant tools and technologies quickly."

"
devops,"- Supported very obsolete setup (I've seen a Gentoo VM in production). This is not an achievement from IT side of view, but it is from business side of view.
- Build an architecture for an in-house product on AWS with CI\CD, monitoring, IPSec networking, etc from complete scratch.
- Solved RedBalloonSecurity HDD challenge for a security researcher position in NYC (I can't post URLs here, but can show you an article on businessinsider/habr about this)
Eh, perhaps I’ll start my story here.
I've started my engineer path at internet providers. After all, back then, in 2011-2012, I did not understand shit about the Internet and how it works. Helping Internet providers build networks was one of the most obvious solutions.
While working in such places, I saw the opportunity to become a NOC engineer. I was very impressed with this position, because, the whole task is to monitor the network, and there is a lot of time to study servers, networks, and, most importantly, I had all the access.
Being an NOC engineer, I was wildly interested in Linux. It seemed to me that Linux is an extremely complicated system, and I was curious to understand this complexity, and what approaches are used to make the system secure and reliable.
Further, I began to look for a Linux engineer kind of job, and spent working for 2.5 years in Swiss Bank. From this position, I understood how a private network between countries is arranged, and looked at my work from the security and approaches point of view
And finally, since 2018, I created a profile on Upwork, found there clients whom I advise on DevOps / System Architecture, and set up the servers myself. Also, I make the development process more convenient for developers. Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Clouds - this is what I'm working with for the past 2 years.
At the moment I am actively studying Kubernetes and have a small lab at home.

"
devops,"Built an application monitoring system that cut down our resources by 30%. This was built using Grafana Dashboards and Prometheus.
Having transitioned from Backend Engineering, I have developed a keen sense for developing scalable and reliable systems. Some of my most daring DevOps projects are described below:

Banking USSD:
USSD is a platform that generates large amounts of short time which also receives a high volume of traffic,, I had to leverage the power of Grafan, Prometheus, and Loki to ensure service reliability always. I made sure to send alerts to relevant teams when issues arise.
The service was also constantly updated which meant Continuous deployment was an important part of our architecture. Using Jenkins and Ansible, I deployed a CI/CD pipeline stable enough to manage constant testing and changes.
Tools: Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Grafana, Loki, Git, Prometheus, Kubernetes, Docker, Load Balancing.

Swift Parser:
The swift messaging system enables banks from all over the world to send transaction messages to each other. Messages from Swift are usually cryptic and needed a lot of skilled experts to decrypt. The solution was a system that could decrypt these messages and present them in clear and human-readable reports. Sitting on an AWS EC2 instance, I leveraged the power of serverless functions to periodically fetch and decrypt messages, ELK fro logging, and Prometheus to capture relevant system data.
Tools: AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, Elk, Docker, Git, Windows/Ubuntu

I'm Currently a senior Backend/DevOps Engineer on my team and spend time mentoring Junior teammates.
I working on my DevOps certification exam with AWS and would be certified in a few weeks.
Challenging projects."
devops,"
Having worked with AWS-based applications for few years, I have created environments, streamlined workflows, and collaborated with security teams to ensure maximal business impact, but it was my bespoke on-premises and cloud solutions that made the most impact.
Managing and maintaining continuous integration environment meant constantly adapting automated scripts to configure and test applications – working closely with my DevOps team members to develop best-in-class scalable solutions. We managed to reduce infrastructure deployment time, designing efficient CI/CD pipelines.
In terms of my tools and solutions knowledge, I am proficient in Git, Terraform, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Virtual Box, Ansible, Jenkins, Linux OS and alongside two  programming languages Python and Bash scripting. I am constantly improving my knowledge and getting new certifications. In general, I love learning and I am not afraid of new challenges. I find pleasure in making DevOps accessible for those who are not technically minded.
My bachelor’s degree from National University of Internal Affairs in system engineering prepared me for the more theoretical aspects of my role but I find the most pleasure when solving a practical problem with my wider team. It is one thing seeking perfection in the logic of code, but that perfection is useless if it does not have the intended real-world impact. 
 I would enjoy embarking on a new journey and enclose my project portfolio to show how I can contribute.

I worked as a system administrator and IT Ops Engineer for a while. I had to work with Hyper-V and VMware virtualization systems. Also troubleshoot problems with the network, setting up network equipment, maintaining servers with basic roles (AD DC, DHCP, VPN, DNS, WBS, WDS, etc.). Therefore, I believe that I have a good basic knowledge.
So then I worked on QA/DevOps for a short time, where I had to work with docker, kubernetes, helm, anisible and sometimes terraform as well.

P.S. Honestly, my level of spoken English is not that good, but I am already working on it. :)

"
devops,"As a DevOps engineer working with big companies, I have had the opportunity to work on some of the most challenging and complex projects in the industry. Over the course of my career, I have accomplished a lot and have made significant contributions to the companies I have worked with.

One of my most notable accomplishments as a DevOps engineer is the successful implementation of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for a large financial institution. This project involved creating a highly automated and efficient deployment process that reduced the time required to deploy new software from weeks to just hours. By implementing this process, the company was able to deliver new features and updates to their customers much faster than before, which greatly improved their overall user experience.

In addition to my work on the CI/CD pipeline, I have also played a key role in the adoption of cloud computing technologies at several of the companies I have worked with. I have helped migrate large legacy applications to the cloud, which has resulted in significant cost savings and improved scalability for these organizations. This has required me to work closely with development teams, architects, and operations teams to ensure that the transition to the cloud was seamless and did not disrupt the day-to-day operations of the business.

Another accomplishment that I am particularly proud of is my work on implementing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices at a large e-commerce company. By adopting IaC, the company was able to automate the process of creating and managing infrastructure, which greatly improved their agility and reduced the risk of human error. This allowed the company to focus more on developing new features and improving their customer experience, rather than spending time on manual infrastructure management.

Lastly, I have been involved in the implementation of several monitoring and logging solutions for big companies. This has included the creation of custom dashboards that provide real-time insights into the health of the systems, as well as the development of alerting and notification systems that quickly identify and respond to any issues. By implementing these solutions, we were able to reduce downtime and improve the overall reliability of the systems.
I am a DevOps Engineer with Backend experience. I helped companies optimize their cloud costs, enhance scalability, reliability and security of their systems. I worked with multiple companies across Africa, America and Europe and earned a reputation of building reliable, secure, scalable infrastructure on AWS and GCP, and helped these companies ship their product a lot faster to over a million users aiming to edge over their competitors. I am so driven towards learning and relearning, my commitment to staying on top of industry trends and innovations has undoubtedly contributed to my success in building and maintaining cutting-edge infrastructure for my clients.

After our graduation, Gebeya ended up recruiting me to be involved in projects that they outsourced from foreign countries. This is where my love and passion for Software Development, Cloud, and DevOps started.
The training I took and the work I have done laid the foundation for me to develop a broad range of IT skills. It allowed me to have an experience in Agile Software Development, Working with Teams, Automation Script Writing, Cloud Computing Concepts, and Usage of DevOps Tools to automate the day-to-day tasks of system administrators and also gave me the knowledge on how to become effective in adapting to new IT environments (...). It also taught me how to get through different kinds of work challenges such as adapting to a new set of tools for different clients, proper communication when working remotely, working with microservices, highly available systems, and cloud-native architecture, developing platforms with security and performance, handling failures in production systems...
Throughout my profession, I've had a variety of roles like Solution Developer, L2 Support Manager, DevOps Engineer, and Cloud Engineer. I also have experience mentoring other developers and system engineers on Cloud Computing Fundamentals and DevOps Engineering. My dedicated interest in the above-mentioned roles is not only because of passion, it's also where I found myself to excel at during my experience. I have the ability to think about a system from end to end while understanding the underlying architecture. This visibility gives me the necessary insights to use when designing/implementing the solution, when testing the platform for performance and security and when debugging platform issues.

Ongoing practical work with startups from Europe and USA

Are you confident about your software infrastructure and deployment processes?
I use ansible (but not limited) orchestration to configure repeatable infrastructure for your production and staging environments. I can help you to implement adequate continuous integration/delivery pipeline that ensures possibility to release your product frequently and in a robust way.

Usually I am sticking on what is important to your business. I won't suggest you use only latest technologies or adopt the latest ""buzz word"" tools and techs unless there will be a clear and measurable benefit for your product.

If you have a problem to solve, I'd love to help. Let's chat.

In some circumstances ,I am also available for custom web application development (usually nodejs/MERN , python, asp.net core2). I am particular about the projects I consider and their business domain on so please get in touch for details.

More formal experience:

My Github profile describes myself better than any nice work description on a profile :) 
I am an Experienced full stack software engineer, with project management background (PMP). I provide both DevOps and Software development services.

High load, bespoke sw development, PM experience (PMP cert) , DevOps(PAAS & Cloud), CI (Jenkins / Bamboo), Pure JS stack, MEAN, sometimes Win. stack (asp.net MVC, MSSQL)

In s/d since 1998, approximately 7 times x 3 years technology periods, during which I was working with
needed at that moment set of technologies. Roles covered were (depending on project) - software developer, lead developer, project architect project manager.

At a current period:
 2017- continue working with startups: R&D activities, cloud, containers, devops ; development in MEAN stack and python ; <censored> enterprise devops platform plugins;
I can help you to define right DevOps approach for your project, and help you to build and implement effectively your devops processes.

I usually provide Ansible based delivery solutions, but I am not limited to single toolset. I am choosing tools depending on customer's delivery specifics.

Deployment scenarios:
- Bare metal servers provisioning 
- AWS provisioning
- DigitalOcean provisioning
- Openstack provisioning
- Monitoring

Continuous integration, most often using: 
- Jenkins setup & workflows
- Gitlab workflows

Virtualization:
- ESX
Part-time, looking for direct abroad customers only.
I am not subcontracting through outsource/out-staff companies at the moment

Per my past experience on previous projects can speed up your team to go further by suggesting  procedures and practices.

Being technologist, with software development agency knowledge and experience, including outsourcing experience with eastern software development companies I can provide a cost effective “CTO on demand” style service which allows you to ensure right direction for your development.

Having practical experience with project management, can analyze and suggest techniques through which you can improve the way your teams deliver, by looking both at architecture and component make-up of your software platforms and project management processes."

I have a long-lasting career in IT, which goes back to ATQC with 10 years on hands experience in testing and automation, after which I’ve shifted to DevOps. For more than 1 year I have worked as a DevOps Engineer on many different projects. My major responsibilities were automation of software lifecycle process from scratch and deployment of staging and production environments. My input allowed to improve the system stability, set up its monitoring, reduce the cost of the build process, increase the frequency of releases, and make it easy for new customers to deploy. I conducted migration from old on-premises servers to the cloud-based ones and rewrote old CI jobs.
I also facilitated teamwork by developing many different scripts that boosted collaboration between team-members.

During my work as DevOps, I also had the opportunity to configure a Kubernetes cluster, automate the scaling of the production environment, develop integration and load tests. I was involved in logs and metrics analysis which helped me to further improve the service. I was also a member of the project's on-call support group.

I consider as one of my valuable contributions a successful migration of a monolithic application into 11 small microservices. I developed an automation process for building and deploying these services, and helped to create a monitoring system to ensure their smooth and reliable operation.

Overall, I believe my diverse experience in automating software lifecycle processes, migrating systems, and setting up monitoring systems combined with my previous experience in ATQC makes me a valuable asset to any organisation looking for a skilled DevOps Engineer.

I have already completed three educational projects. The first of them is named ""Wagtail-Postgres"". It joins up the Wagtail web application framework and PostgreSQL database. I used technologies such as Linux, Docker, Docker-compose, and so Python language in this project. This project allows you to create an image for the Wagtail application and runs the container web app and database for this app. The second project has the name ""aws-k8s-cluster"". This project is intended to test the possibility of integrations of Elastic Kubernetes Services and the Prometheus monitoring system. It allows you to deploy a simple K8s cluster with a monitoring system. And last but not least ""Wagtail-AWS-terraform"". This project includes technologies such as AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and also Git. This project's deploy infrastructure in AWS consists of one or more EC2 Instances, RDS Instances, security groups for these instances, load balancer, and Route53 record. After that, I raising the Jenkins node, build the image and deploy the Wagtail app.

My job for the past 3 to 4 years was not only to implement the CICD and SDLC but to manage the whole infrastructure in companies ranging from 15 up to 500 people with multiple teams, projects and so on.
I can set up an infrastructure to run the application on and build a full CI/CD pipeline for than application from scratch.
I am proficient with tools like Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure provisioning and environment configuration. 
I feel confident when working with Kubernetes at any scale, from the single cluster with a few applications on to multi-regional beasts with thousands of services. I am aware of the pitfalls and I know how to bake Kubernetes to achieve the best possible availability and performance. And for that, I use a lot of tools to build a wide range of observability systems, like Prometheus, Thanos, Loki, Opsgenie, and so on. For CI systems I usually use Gitlab CI and Jenkins, although if we talking Kubernetes the Gitlab will fit much better. The instrument of choice for CD is ArgoCD but you can mix and match a lot of other tools into this chain which I sometimes do. Clouds: AWS and GCP - around 3 years of experience in each with multiple successful projects deployed in production.

I'm Infrastructure Architect with over 15 years of experience.
Throughout those years I've been working in different roles: System Administrator/Developer(Full stack)/Devops/Architect. 
Last 5 years I'm positioning myself as Infrastructure Architect with experience ranging from startups to enterprise grade environments.

During my career development, I have been helping to introduce newest solutions, architect and build infrastructure for such industry leaders as Fox Sports (USA), Warner Brothers Group (USA), DigiCert Inc. (USA), one of the largest European logistics companies Wolters Kluwer (Brussels, Belgium), world leader in iGaming solutions Everymatrix (global), Colt Data Center Services (global), Cisco (USA) and Grapeshot’s Contextual Intelligence Platform/acquired by Oracle (USA). 

Over the years, I have continuously expanded the scope of my technological skills which currently include: configuration management, user management, log management, CI/CD, infrastructure as code, backups management, disaster recovery, authentication and authorization implementations, immutable infrastructure, serverless, gitops solutions and security best practices. I possess in depth understanding of and experience in network and security architecture. I have a knowledge of many, if not most, aspects of a cloud infrastructure, including AWS and Google cloud. My expertise also extends to the private cloud, including providers like vSphere, Open Stack, Open Shift and Kubernetes. 

I strongly believe Devops culture is the key success factor in any organization. Spinning whole environments with the click of a button. Using platform automation for public, private or hybrid clouds. Using configuration management software to provision cluster layers. Monitoring every aspect of infrastructure. Centralized multi level logging systems. Centralized authentication. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Designing for failure and scalability with multi region datacenters in mind. Automated backups and disaster recovery. Multi layered security. Immutable infrastructure. PAAS solutions. Serverless. General automation culture and treating infrastructure as a versioned code. This is in short what is Devops culture is all about. This is the recipe not just for any robust and successful organization but for industry leaders.

In January 2023 , I moved to Kyiv for the second time, first in 2021, and then on February 24th, I returned to Dnipro for 8 months. In the IT field since 2015, I started as an 'anykey' and worked in all stages of support, ultimately choosing the path of DevOps.
At Perenio/Infobit, I was involved in IoT. We followed the Kanban methodology and wrote pipelines in Groovy for CI/CD, troubleshooting, and bug fixes. There was a project involving migrating the existing CI/CD infrastructure to Job DSL. Job DSL allows writing a pipeline once with all environment variables and then, upon execution, generates multiple Pipeline Jobs in Jenkins with a listView. It was challenging as I hadn't previously worked with Groovy, Docker, and Jenkins pipelines. I had to learn a lot of information, and in the end, everything worked out. The technology stack included Jenkins, Docker, AWS EC2, S3 bucket, IAM, Route 53, and GitLab. An interesting aspect was migrating the existing project's infrastructure to Job DSL. We deployed Jenkins using Docker containers.
Later, I moved to Infobit as an SRE, writing Bash scripts for automating routine tasks like database backups and SSH key generation. I focused more on Linux server administration, setting up CI in TeamCity, using tools like Ansible, GitHub, and the same AWS services. There weren't any particularly exciting projects; they mainly involved supporting the existing infrastructure.
I also had a two-month project at 42flows.tech. The technology stack included Portainer, and in addition to the previously mentioned AWS services, I became familiar with CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, ECR, and Zabbix monitoring system administration.
In my current company, CodeGym, we have two products that need maintenance. Among the exciting tasks, I did many things for the first time: Set up an Ansible server for task automation and playbook writing.
Migrated two projects to pipeline jobs from scratch.
Wrote a sitemap crawler in Python that runs in a Docker container. 
I realized that I enjoy automating processes and writing CI/CD pipelines. I'm constantly learning and evolving. Recently, I took a course on the basics of DevOps and Kubernetes to fill gaps in theory and practice.
I would prefer to focus on roles that align more closely with my expertise and career aspirations. While I have gained experience in various aspects of IT, including support and administration, I am not particularly interested in positions related to office administration or Service Desk roles. Instead, I'm passionate about DevOps and automation, as well as building and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines. My goal is to continue growing in these areas and eventually contribute as a Senior Specialist, sharing my knowledge and helping companies thrive in the rapidly evolving technology landscape."

"
devops,"As a DevOps Engineer, I have achieved several accomplishments throughout my career. Some of my notable accomplishments include:

Implementing a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for a web application using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. This resulted in a faster and more reliable deployment process and reduced the time required for testing and releasing new features.

Implementing a monitoring and logging solution using Prometheus and ELK stack, which improved the visibility and performance of the application, and enabled the team to quickly identify and resolve issues.

Automating the deployment process using Ansible reduced the time required for manual configuration and increased the consistency and reliability of the infrastructure.

Developing a disaster recovery plan for the infrastructure, which reduced the risk of data loss and ensured the availability of the application in case of an emergency.

Migrating the application from on-premises to AWS, reduced the costs and improved the scalability and performance of the application.

Led a team of developers and engineers to design, implement and maintain the infrastructure and platform that supports the company's products.

Participated in an incident management process, which improved the availability and reliability of the application and reduced the mean time to recovery.

I worked on security compliance, by implementing security best practices, policies, and standards such as SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

Implemented a cost optimization strategy that reduced infrastructure costs by 30%.

Overall, my accomplishments have helped to improve the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of the infrastructure and platform, and have enabled the company to deliver high-quality products and services to its customers.
In my previous role as a DevOps Engineer, I have completed several projects and tasks that have allowed me to gain experience with a variety of technologies and processes. One of my main projects was the implementation of a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for a web application. This project involved setting up Jenkins as the CI/CD tool, configuring it to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a staging environment, and then to a production environment. Additionally, I have used technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible to containerize the application and automate the deployment process.

I have also been involved in implementing monitoring and logging solutions, such as Prometheus and ELK stack, to ensure high availability and performance of the application. Additionally, I have experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure and GCP, and I have been responsible for deploying, scaling and managing the application on the cloud.

Currently, I am working as a Senior DevOps Engineer, my role in the team is to lead a team of developers and engineers to design, implement, and maintain the infrastructure and platform that supports the company's products. I am responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure is secure, scalable, and highly available. I also provide guidance and mentorship to the team members, and I ensure that the team is following best practices and industry standards.

In terms of areas that I want to improve, I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the DevOps field. I am currently interested in learning more about service meshes and service orchestration technologies like Istio and Kubernetes. Additionally, I am interested in exploring the use of machine learning and AI in the DevOps process to improve the efficiency and reliability of the infrastructure. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge to better serve the team and the company.

Currently I'm working on a large streaming music service with more that 1M active users. My role is to extend and improve existing infrastructure, optimise cost and processes. I took part in a large migration from TeamCity to CircleCI,  was leading FaaS project implementation,  improved Terraform practices, monitoring tools and supported multiple Kubernetes clusters.

I am a quick learner and problem solver, who is comfortable working both alone and in a big team. Since all my curent teammates are in the US, California, I got experience of working independently, dealing with existing infrastructure without external help.  Now I am ready for a new challenge.

I've been working in Informational and Computing Center of Kyiv National University of Taras Shevchenko as a member of the Support group, which was maintaining the connection to the Internet in local dormitories for students.

Before I've got that job, I've had some basic training, where I aquired basic skills in working with CentOS, such as working with file systems, packet managers and basic administrating tools; Nginx, where I needed to create a file server with directory listing; Ansible, where I needed to automate the whole proccess with Nginx. I've also managed to create a custom distribution of Linux using Linux From Scratch.

While I was working as a Support, I've aquired some skills in working with people, where I helped them to get access to the Internet on the user end; and network equipment, where I was replacing broken parts and reflashing switches. Additionally to that, I took part in creating a training room for future network administrators, where they would be able to check their skills in setting up network equipment, such as enterprise switches and routers.

Outside of work, I've had a little home project, where I basically just set up a SMB file server and shared a printer.
My expectations are: maintaining existing server and network infrastructure, setting up new services, automating the whole process.

I'm really not fond of programming and creating new services from scratch."

I've been working on 3 projects. 

1st one - it was big sitecore platform that was created for selling cars in the UK. Basically I was dealing with Azure cloud and bamboo CI/CD tool. My daily rootine tasks were supporting existing azure infrastructure and creating the new one, using ARM templates, also I was supporting CICD in bamboo tool with a lot of powershell scripts, I was dealing with pipelines. Also there are was a lot of collaboration with different teams (developers, QA) and customer as well.  The most interesting activity it was migration of Sitecore from VM into Azure web app, I was dealing a lot with investigations from infra part like performance side and from code side as well

2nd one - it was security project, I was dealing with python. We have own framework for SAST and DAST scans and I was writing python modules for that framework. Also I've participated in security activities, for example there was a task to parse KB that all people from company use for the sensitive information. So daily activities was python scripting. And the most the most interesting task, it was writing UI application, that will be inserting license header into projects.

3rd - it was sitecore platform what was created for selling kitchens in UK, pretty big account. And I was dealing with Azure cloud and Azure DevOps. My daily routine tasks were supporting existing azure infrastructure and creating the new one using Terraform. And CI/CD with implemented in Azure DevOps, so big part of routine - it was yaml pipelines and powershell as well. The most interesting parts of work - microservices, creating new one, supporting, troubleshooting.

Joining my previous company as a Java developer, I was soon offered to participate in a project focused on infrastructure. We formed a specialized team for this task. Our first major project involved moving the existing infrastructure to AWS. Essentially, we had to invent the architecture from scratch, which was incredibly interesting.

Since then, I have mostly worked as a DevOps engineer, although I occasionally performed tasks as a Java developer. I really enjoyed this direction of work, and I aim to continue developing in this area, while not being opposed to writing code when needed.

My main competencies include working with IaC, in particular, CloudFormation, as well as other key services such as S3, ECR, ECS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Security services, CodePipelines, CodeBuilds, CloudWatch, SNS.

"
devops,"I have GitHub project, in which I developed “APIservice for books’s/films reviews” - as the team lead on a collaborative project, I was responsible for developing the entire user management system. This involved creating and implementing a registration and authentication system, handling access rights and permissions, managing tokens, and developing an e-mail confirmation system. Overall, my efforts helped to ensure a seamless and secure user experience, contributing to the success of the project as a whole.

Throughout my career in Agile with cross-functional teams and deliver products efficiently, I have gained experience with the entire deployment lifecycle in high-load production systems. This includes updating application servers, installing and managing microservices at OpenShift, testing, creating pipelines with Jenkins job development and configuration in Groovy and XML, and optimizing the pipeline with a Python script. Through my efforts, I was able to reduce the number of remote hosts from 12 to 3, ultimately lowering the number of servers required by the IBM vendor.

I have bachelor’s degree in Informatics and Computer Science.
Key Skills:
Jenkins, Oracle DB Administration, Red Hat OpenShift, Linux, IBM WebSphere, Grafana, XML, Groovy, Python(Django), Git, Nexus
English level - B2

Work Experience - 3 years

As a DevOps Engineer:
1. Installation of microservices improvements on Openshift production database. 
2. Develop and configured Jenkins-job using an XML config file and Groovy. The implemented job downloads Python-scripts from Bitbucket and launches them remotely on IBM WebSphere Application Server.
3. Creating a pipeline was necessary to reduce the number of servers used by the vendor. As a result, the number of remote hosts was reduced from 12 to 3, and pipeline administrators can independently set launch parameters.
4. Integrate a connection to the database on Openshift for IntelliJ IDEA IDE, which made it possible to directly receive requests from the database through PL/SQL queries. Wrote an instruction - istruction for connect Intellij IDEA to Oracle.docx 

My tasks as a Release Engeneer: weekly installation of releases (CI/CD) on Prod (personal loans and mortgages DB) and administering the Oracle database in Standby mode. Monitoring service performance, analyzing logs, and resolving incidents. Release testing and communication with developers. Communication with shift monitoring.
Control the execution of such business operations like scheduled tasks, such as customer rollouts to overdue debts and payment double date.

Worked with the Linux package manager:
Partitioning and mounting of data carriers, familiar with monitoring through htop, and used systemctl commands.

My Python projects:

devops,"I'm proud of many things. Speaking on one of the biggest tech conferences in Ukraine, building infrastructure with 0 serious incidents over 2 years.
Last 2.5 years I was working in great (but not successful enough) product, with an awesome team. Now I want something similar but being nicely paid as well :)

I'm not the person that would wait for a task, continuous improvement is my credo.
Love coding in Golang.
I don't want to do Java.

I prefer working in small product companies, lost the habit of tracking working hour in some weird company software and speaking with tons of Project Managers.

I certified AWS engineer, but I would like to work with GCP or another cloud as well (I did work with it, but not even close compared to my AWS experience)"

devops,"Created CI/CD pipelines from scratch that remains actual for years
Got many approved security reviews/architecture designs
Operations on prod database without incidents
Automated many things using Python (not shitty scripting, but real prod applications, supported by other people)
Many ex coworkers still ask me for assistance in DevOps questions, bigger amount of them are Developers of course
Haven't changed company for 4 years, and don't like to do so
Last project was big enterprise healthcare with quite small team (~8 people). Was responsible for creating high-level design, security reviews approve, project certification, configuring CI/CD according to company policies, monitoring and alerting. Tools used: Terraform, Python3, AWS, SignalFX, Dotnet, Docker, Jfrog artifactory, helm3, OpenSearch, Kubernets, Lambda, Canary deployment. I have really big experience with creating Python3 code or supporting existing one.

Side project I keep working on/supporting it is educational platform. Details will be provided in interview later if needed.

I am looking for those bulletins:
- office in Kharkiv/Kyiv
- no 24/7 support
- one team for which I can fully give my working time and support it with any questions (related to non-devops questions too)
- if possible I would like to get deeper in codebase and application logic too
- I really don't want to report in 3-4 different places, less reports = more working time
- if meeting could have been an email better to have it as an email
- despite my meetings hate I am really very communicative person and never decline 1-1 meetings to resolve problems or to chat about something
I want to have fast CI/CD process that will be loved by my devs. Want to help them build secure and fast application. Don't want to have spaghetti-like pipelines, Terraform self-scripted wrappers, overengineering at any level, seeing code doing infrastructure level things (custom loggers) and vice versa. Don't like Windows, working from MacBook."

My last position was System Administrator at some Magento support company. Planning, deploying, and supporting LEMP servers as well as creating and maintaining tons of bash scripts is really exciting job for me -- but now it is time to go further.

I want to learn how to automate all those activities. I'm really tired of deploying things URGENTLY but manually (OK... mostly manually). I just love when everything is described, formalized, scripted, versioned, and IaC'ed to the end.

I'd like to find a company where opportunity of using my existing experience would be combined with continuous obtaining of new knowledge. Lots of new knowledge. I'm eager to learn."

My first project:

Building infrastructure via Terraform code on AWS platform. Main services that were used are VPC, EC2, IAM, S3, Route53, RDS. Infrastructure configuration via Ansible roles and playbooks. Continuous integration, delivery and deployment of internal applications via GitLab version control system. Working on containerizing by using docker. Creating docker-compose files for 2 different internal applications and using them in our Ansible code for automated deployment.

My second project:

Migrating Jenkins to Bitbucket. Creating new bitbucket pipelines for continuous integration, delivery and deployment. Separate CI/CD for different environments such as dev, staging and prod. Containerize those services via Docker, create Dockerfiles and docker-composes to deploy services and simplify building application to reduce build time. Working on automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized services based on Kubernetes clusters. Writing Helm Charts for monitoring services Prometheus, Grafana and Fluentbit. Also, setting up alert system to notify our team about cpu, memory, disk space and other usage, setting up slack notifications. Collecting the logs for efficient workaround regarding any problem, quick access and simplicity (EFK stuck). Setup Nginx-Ingress with AWS provided certificate to the necessary domain. Used to work with AWS EKS as our provider and orchestration solution for this project. Creating project documentation with schemas of infrastructure, logical algorithm with code to describe how it works and posted it on Confluence.

The third one:

Refactoring Terraform code to update services on Azure platform. Using Azure DevOps as our version control system for building pipelines to transfer data that are in different data types from one service to another. Main object is big data processing, so I supported Azure Data Factory, Synapse and Databricks flow. Configuration transferring data on purpose via Data Flow and backing it up to Azure Blob Storage.

The fourth one:

Create infrastructure in GCP via Terraform code. Also, create microservices via helm charts that are deployed through terraform modules to Google Kubernetes Cluster. Was working on 19 custom applications with deployments, services, hpa. Nginx-ingress should route the traffic to 10 of that custom applications via service path. Setup monitoring and logging. Grafana & Prometheus + EFK stuck. Was integrating alert manager to slack & Microsoft teams.

My IT career began as a DevOps intern at EPAM systems almost 6 years ago, where I'm working till the day I'm writing this.
I would describe myself as a passionate engineer focused on end product and it's quality, who preaches to turn ideas into architecture, with a decent specification of its' components.
In general, my experience is a set of e-commerce projects, some of them were migrating to cloud, some other were decopling monolith into microservices.

CI/CD is my core skill. Big-picture view from CI/CD perspective helps me to weigh the pros and cons of using particular tool, instead of striving use it because I used to it.

My passion is integrating new things, replacing legacy to cutting-edge, bootstraping new applications, which should interact with existing ones, properly declaring processes by introducing best-practice framework for it.

Сonsciously balancing the love of working alone and the desire to be part of a team, I had developed finesse being mate for colleagues, following all cultural concepts, Agile, ITIL 4 etc.

My featured thing is ability to quickly create and order action items, for any given input requirement. This quality unlocks the rapid research skills, required for troubleshooting or POC solutions.

I do believe my skills would benefit each of us, so placing my abilities at your service would emphasize our value co-creation.

My university’s team developed telegram bot (IKTA-Explorer) for first year student at Lviv Polytechnic National University. My responsibility was for automation starting Python code. I used Docker+Jenkins for creating artifact that push to DockerHub.
"
devops,"At my first job as a Linux System Administrator, thanks to well-established communication, we were able to abandon on-premise solutions and begin migrating to the cloud. Most of the work was done by me and some other people from my team. At that time, we were moving to the Scaleway cloud provider because their pricing policy was the most suitable for the company. I seamlessly migrated our clients' production systems. 
After that, I started working as a Junior Release & Build Specialist in another company. My main achievement there was that I was able to set up basic accounting and monitoring of the entire infrastructure of the project I was working on. Later on, I had the opportunity to be a team leader for some time and, together with other guys from the team, we brought this whole thing to completion, but the most important thing was that our approach and all of our code could be applied to almost any other project in the company.
At my current job, I have been developing a Docker image of our product. The final result works as the development team intended it to. Then I've started developing deploy pipeline for that image. The most challenging aspect of developing the deployment pipeline was taking into account the product's specific features and requirements. At this point I think my achievement here was to create cooperation and transparent communication between developers team and devops team.
My work experience includes several roles in the field of IT operations, starting with the position of Linux System Administrator in local startup from 2018 to 2020. In this role, I was responsible for the quick deployment of a company's CMS/CRM system on Ubuntu/Debian-based servers, maintenance of already deployed servers, user administration, and monitoring system performance.

From 2021 to 2022, I worked as a Junior Release & Build Specialist in game development company. The responsibilities in this role included managing CI/CD systems especially QuickBuild (sometimes Jenkins, depending on project), triaging build and data generation errors, configuring and managing build machines, producing and releasing official versions of the product, monitoring the build dashboard, and monitoring production infrastructures.

Currently, I'm working as a DevOps Engineer in a big outsource company since 2022. The responsibilities in this role include designing, building, and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to automate software delivery processes, developing and maintaining infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools such as Terraform and Ansible, monitoring and troubleshooting production systems and applications, including responding to incidents and outages, and providing root cause analysis, and developing and maintaining monitoring and alerting systems, including logs, metrics, and dashboards, to ensure high availability and performance of production systems.

On my previous roles as a DevOps engineer, I have worked on several projects and completed various tasks. One notable project involved implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the software delivery process. This included setting up version control systems like Git, configuring build tools such as GitLab-ci, Jenkins, and ArgoCD, and orchestrating containerization with Docker. Additionally, I utilized infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and configuration management tools like Ansible to streamline the provisioning and configuration of cloud resources.

In another project, I focused on enhancing system monitoring and logging capabilities. I implemented tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics while leveraging ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized logging and analysis. These technologies helped improve the observability and troubleshooting of the system.

In my role as an AWS Cloud Engineer, I have had the opportunity to work with several AWS services and projects. One notable project I worked on involved migrating a company's infrastructure from an on-premises data center to the AWS cloud. This migration required a comprehensive understanding of AWS services and a well-designed architecture.

To facilitate the migration, I leveraged AWS services such as Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) to provision and manage virtual servers. I utilized Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for secure and scalable object storage, ensuring efficient data transfer and backup. Additionally, I implemented Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to manage and scale relational databases and Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to create isolated network environments.

In terms of monitoring and management, I utilized AWS CloudWatch to collect and analyze metrics and logs from various AWS services.

As the AWS Cloud Engineer, my responsibilities included designing and implementing a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture, optimizing cost-efficiency, ensuring security and compliance, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.
In my role as a DevOps engineer, I have had the opportunity to work with AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), which is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. EKS simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters, allowing me to focus on application development and scalability.

Over 13 years of combined experience in the IT industry and telecommunication, I have worked as a DevOps Engineer for 3 years. My primary focus has been on designing and developing solutions that cater to platform enhancements in the areas of infrastructure and development.

Recent projects:
Environmental Product Declaration Platform project (2021-2023), I was involved in the implementation of the infrastructure based on Azure and the integration of DevOps processes. For container orchestration, Kubernetes was utilized, and the CI/CD pipeline was managed through GitLab CI. The infrastructure was maintained through Terraform, and monitoring was achieved with Prometheus/Grafana. 
The technologies used include Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, HELM, Docker, Terraform, GitLab, Prometheus, Grafana, Graylog, and Ansible. 
Additionally, I managed the process of migrating Kubernetes clusters into a single zone in Azure, managed issues with persistent volumes, and periodically monitored and analyzed the cost of resource usage in the Cloud. I also conducted periodical infrastructure vulnerability scans using Greenbone.

AI and ML, Intelligent Document Processing Platform project (2020-2021) - a Python Flask application that could upload documents (PDF or scanned documents), process them with a neural network. I deployed the application on AWS Cloud. The technologies used include Linux Ubuntu, Git, GitLab, Python, and Docker. I built and maintained the CI/CD pipeline using GitLab and deployed the application on AWS on EC2 instance, configured Elastic IP, and configured VPC, and Security Group with Inbound and Outbound rules.

Analytics Platform project (2019-2021), I was involved in the designing and creation of a mobile network quality monitoring tool that allowed specific network quality key performance indicators and ARPU to be illustrated on the map and displayed in a grid view. The following technologies were used: Kubernetes for container orchestration, managed the CI/CD pipeline through Jenkins, configured the infrastructure through Ansible, and stored data using MongoDB. Additionally, I provided the design of the platform and created product requirements for proper reporting features.

devops,"1. Saving private RabbitMQ, part 1: RabbitMQ cluster was unstable due default configuration - split-brain happened quite often and it was a real pain. I have configured pause minority feature and done some minor improvements to make RabbitMQ work as expected! 
2. Saving private RabbitMQ, part 2: developers faced with heartbeat problems as they used single threaded synchronous programming language (guess which one?). There are several solutions from application side, but all of them are not very sophisticated (like to fork child process to handle heartbeats, furthermore it is not  framework feature). Also, heartbeat could be disabled at all, but it is not what we wanted. I found the solution: we can use underling Linux network stack feature - tcp keapalives! It works like a charm! 
And RabbitMQ has become one of the most reliable service hosted in ECS. 
3.  Hand crufted ingress controller for ECS services: you have experience with nginx, but do not want to pay for nginx+ to get API and envoy was not so popular. Nginx + Consul + consul-template is your choice! Devops team is able to configure nginx using terraform - you write defined keys to consul and consul-template generates valid nginx configuration and reloads nginx.
4. And the latest Kubernetes news: I needed to run ECK (Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes), but there was not k8s cluster running. And standard way to create k8s cluster (EKS in current case) did not exist either. I decided to use terraform and community module. But it was only beginning: clean cluster is useless, so, I had to setup all necessary controllers/operators like ebs-csi-driver, lb-controller, external-dns etc. Finally, ECK is up and running and, yeap, we need a monitoring system. I chose prometheus, alertmanager, grafana stack and installed it using helm chart which includes prometheus operator. Essentially, ECK was a small part of the puzzle.

Almost forgot about two AWS certificates:
- Solutions architect associate
- Database specialty
Probably, I will not write every technology which I am familiar with, better I will try to tell about my working experience evolution for the last 5 years.

1. I started working as linux system administrator. It was pre cloud era for me and my toolkit was  bash, grep, awk, rsync, ssh, iptables (netfilter), kvm, lvm etc. Remember those discussions what distributive is better - Ubuntu or CentOS (Gentoo beats them all). A bit later I have been familiar with cluster concepts for databases(Mysql, Postgresql, redis), distributed FS (glusterfs), load balancers (haproxy, ipvs), web servers (nginx, apache2).
2. The next step was AWS and terraform - creating different cloud resources using IaC approach. At the same time I read a few books about python and it has become my another interest. 
3. Changed position to full time DevOps engineer. I have been heavily using my python knowledge to create CI/CD scripts invoked by TeamCity, automate backups using AWS lambda, automate everything for what terraform is not the best choice.
At that time I have already faced docker and had some basic knowledge about container orchestration. 
4. Microservices, containers and ECS. Also have got experience with message queue solutions like Redis (simple queues) and RabbitMQ (message broker with different routing rules).
5. Kubernetes and cloud native: EKS, helm, operators/controllers, servicemesh. 

My goal is to be a good engineer with deep knowledge in OS, distributed system(including kubernetes),  programming. I do not want to be a yaml programmer only.
I prefer working in product companies since you are part of some society and share success and loses together. 
And it allows to avoid supporting several quite different projects at the same time. In my opinion, frequent context switching is not very efficient (I had such experience)."

Cisco Linux Essentials-certificate,
Experience with real life projects at company,
Constant development of skills and desire to be better.
So, at the moment  I have an a rich experience as a DevOps Engineer. I working with different tasks for example: Building/Maintaining the AWS fully managed infrastructure by terraform, creating and deploying microservices infrastructure (ECS Fargate, and needed depending on service e.g.RDS), setting up CI/CD workflows by BitBucket/GitHub Actions with further deployment of different parts of the project, working with DNS (Set up domain names, change DNS records etc.), set VPN for other members of a team so that they can access specific part of private infrastructure and so on. I am always trying to gain new experience and hope in the future to reach new heights.

Additionally attending SoftServe IT Academy DevOps Internship for 3 months. At the academy, I gained valuable experience as a DevOps engineer. I worked with a bunch of different technologies like Ansible, MySQL, Terraform, Jenkins, Git/GitHub, Python, Tomcat, Nginx, GCP, Docker, Docker-compose, Vagrant, Linux (Centos/Ubuntu). Deploying open-source Java application to Google Cloud Platform, creating infrastructure by Terraform (creation of VM's, VPC Network with private and public subnets), configuring this VM's by Ansible (writing different playbooks for installing bunch of dependencies, configuring and installing Jenkins etc). After Jenkins was setuped (Creation of users, installing plugins), writing Jenkins pipelines (Jenkinsfiles) for execution of playbooks, where setup connection with GCP in order to access bucket with docker images, after that containers was created with appropriate software like Tomcat, Nginx etc. 

It was a great experience, that upgraded me like, a DevOps, but that's not all. I am always trying to develop myself by passing udemy courses, trying smth new, pet projects, and just doing research in different fields of knowledge. The most important and valuable sign of a chosen path is practice, practice and again practice. I will be happy to supplement your team, gain new knowledge, because in this exchange, all sides are winners.
Opportunities for further development, growth as a DevOps engineer and like a personality too."

devops,"One Last biggest implemented challenge - completely change test process and re-work test pipelines for RnD and Q&A teams. This improvement leaded to reducing costs for licenses and faster delivery pipeline with same level of quality. Used technologies: ansible, k8s and custom internal tools.

Build new cloud based environment and delivery pipeline from scratch with AWS and Github actions for distributed team. Main puropse and requirement for this project - be lightweight and easier to start as possible for all. Provide new teams and personnel ability to work without unnecessary pressure from old-style standards.

Improvements in QG pipelines for RnD teams to make their life easier in scope of interaction with low-level rapidly changed environments. Most used technologies here is Jenkins with groovy pipelines and ansible.

Building reliable staged environment on top of provided client hardware. From on-prem bare metal installation to production ready infra with tenths of VMs and services less a two months. Used technologies: ansible, docker, swarm cluster and gitlab eco-system for ci/cd processes.
Started as system administrator many years ago, later switched firstly to devops position and SRE.

After ~ 7 month I was promoted to the group lead, since then and for next ~ 5 months to main responsibilities was added onboard processes for new teammates and helping my shift with most challenging tasks.
Next step was promotion to the DevOps and moving as dedicated one to the team that has working with a healthcare project (AWS, Kubernetes as a service, Helm, Helmfile, Kafka, ELK, Prometheus + Grafana, MongoDB as a service). As for team responsibilities - setup of new deployment pipelines using Jenkins, architecture planning, assisting dev team on problem solve, writing scripts, investigation of new products and servers support.
3 years ago I've moved to the new company, where I was working on fintech product til the October 2021. As for stack and responsibilities - responsibilities left the same as they were but stack was moved to the Azure cloud.
After it, I'd moved to the Sigma Software. But after 4 month I decided to move on.

devops,"I have participated in large projects that utilize AWS/Azure infrastructure with a team of 50+ DevOps engineers. The monthly costs for the development environment amount to approximately $3 million. I also have certifications on AWS/GCP, Red Hat certified specialist in Openshift on OpenStack.
With approximately 4 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer, I have actively contributed to diverse projects involving the development of IoT devices, as well as desktop, web, and mobile applications. While the majority of my projects embraced the Agile approach, specifically utilizing the Scrum methodology, I am also well-versed in the Waterfall methodology.

My primary technology stack encompasses Virtualization, Containerization, Cloud Computing, CI/CD, scripting, and microservices. Throughout my career, I have successfully addressed both internal and external requirements, encompassing various aspects such as code development, security, testing, debugging processes, architectural design, deployment strategies, and logging and monitoring standards. Furthermore, I have gained significant expertise in constructing and maintaining scalable, secure, and highly available solutions on prominent Cloud Providers and Microservices platforms.

Intrigued by cutting-edge advancements, I have a particular interest in emerging technologies including Big Data, Blockchain, IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Possessing a strong inclination towards collaborative work, I exhibit open-mindedness, adaptability, and a remarkable ability to navigate dynamic environments. Additionally, my communication skills and sense of humor contribute to establishing effective professional relationships.
"
devops,"As for me, there is important not only know some technologies but also:
1. Be responsilbe during critical moments: during rolling upgrade of software on network elements there was some accident where I as a junior engineer need to evaluate failure and escalate to expert team in time. If did not it properly - it would has big impact to company reputation and relations with customers
2. Build strong relationship with customers (or stakeholders): during deploying network management platform for enterprise customer we would need to clarify every step with specific goals: when we decide that the task is completed? Has our team take into account some nuances from customer? As a result during deploying platform I take a part in every meeting with customer, suggesting solutions for senior engineers and write raw documentation (for further improving by senior engineers and sending this documentation to local enterprise customer engineering team for better maintenance).
With my experience both network engineer and devops engineer I has the following experience (I:
1. Performing deployment and support docker containers with network management platform (performing smooth upgrades of network hardware, take metrics and alerts etc). Also sometimes automate state of this containers and manage them via bash scripts. Sometimes happens faults with some critical container so I need to troubleshoot them (for example, fixing nginx container)
2. Writing bash and python scripts for collecting logs on servers or network hardware. After collecting this scripts - creating a table with parsed output for further analyzing by senior network engineers
3. Has a part-time project where I practicing Gitlab CI: creating pipeline which can build and store images in Gitlab container registry, after that apply simple AWS imfrastructure via Terraform and deploy on EC2 instances docker containers with microservices (Example you may see in my CV, but this is a cut version according to NDA). 4. Also has a project with study-purpose Terraform script, which I tested many AWS infrastructure resources such as EC2, ASG, ALB, VPC etc. This elements was deployed in part-time project.
1. I wish to participate in interesting projects which has great benefits both for company customers and society.
2. Friendly team, with clear task management where I can contribute to core values of the company and improve myself"

Experienced DevOps engineer with more than 10 years of experience in IT, passion for automation, continuous learning, and knowledge-sharing culture promotion. Dedicated to staying updated with the latest industry trends and advocating for the adoption of ""everything-as-code"" principles.

I have worked for various companies and projects throughout my career, consistently delivering excellent results, improving existing and introducing new practices and approaches. I have gained extensive experience not only in industry-standard tools, like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, etc., but also in not so popular, but not less helpful ones, like Buildpacks, Task, JSONNET, etc. To make my endeavors even more efficient, I leverage programming languages like Golang, Python, and Shell scripting to automate chore tasks and streamline operations.

At my last position, I was responsible for DevOps practices introduction and implementation, and successfully migrated projects and services to modern technology stacks. The biggest challenge was not to just introduce some modern tools, but to explain, how they can help to achieve better and more stable results.  Despite the complexity, the endeavor yielded remarkable outcomes, significantly reducing feature time-to-market, as well as debugging and troubleshooting efforts.

Not interested in outsourcing companies' offers, sorry.

I don't yet have the experience of creating things from scratch. I was mostly involved in troubleshooting/supporting an existing stack of solutions.

Would prefer a product company with an interesting project which has noticeable influence and/or impact on the ways the internet works today. I would be just as interested to work within a small team with an interesting product as being part of a big company doing some complicated project. Having my job influence things in a positive sense, i.e. making some systems secure or developing security-related tools, would be very nice.

Definitely would _not_ want to work on tasks which can be automated or got rid of/avoided with proper processes within the company. I'd prefer not to choose a job the core of which is churning through dull, repetitive tasks.

Would prefer to work remotely. In case 100% remote is not possible, we can agree on some hybrid option."

I’m an experienced DevOps engineer with over 20 years of diversified experience of working in the IT industry. I had experience working as a System Engineer and Administrator, DevOps Engineer, Software Engineer, DBA. For the last 7 years, I’ve been mostly working in platform engineering as a DevOps Engineer for projects varying from startups to enterprises.

I have a solid background in AWS, Kubernetes, infrastructure automation, CI/CD. My expertise also extends to the private cloud based on OpenStack. I believe in IaC and GitOps and prefer following immutable infrastructure pattern when possible.
I think, at present, Kubernetes with dozens of Cloud Native projects and tools is one of the most adapted application platforms in terms of observability, maintainability, scalability, resilience and reliability, availability, etc. And I tend to utilize K8s and cloud-native projects and tools like Helm, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Istio, KEDA, ArgoCD, etc. whenever it is suitable and possible.

At present, I hold a few active AWS certifications - AWS Solutions Architect Professional, AWS Certified Database Specialty, AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty, also I’m a certified Kubernetes professional - CKA, CKAD, CKS.

I'm a good team player with strong self-motivation and good communication skills and can work independently, in a team or lead a small team.

With my experience in system engineering, platform engineering, software development, I think I’m a good candidate for the positions of Lead Platform Engineer or DevOps Engineer or  DevOps Architect with focus on AWS and Kubernetes.

Summary

I am a network engineer at ISP RadioNetwork, where I monitor network nodes, administer optical line terminals, routers, and switches. I also document networks and provide technical support to legal subscribers.

I also served as a leading IT consultant at Lviv Regional State Administration, where I successfully created multiple Telegram bots, organized an information guide for the wartime period in Notion, provided consultations for the creation of a corporate messenger, and installed and configured the Starlink terminal.

Previously, I worked as a system administrator in various companies, specializing in computer maintenance and repair, server and network infrastructure setup, and monitoring service security, video surveillance, and Python programming for task automation.

Working with different companies and projects has allowed me to develop skills in various IT areas, including network engineering, system administration, computer repair, and programming. I am always open to new challenges, ready to utilize my skills to tackle complex tasks, and continuously strive to expand my knowledge in the field of technology.

devops,"
I am a passionate Python backend developer & DevOps engineer with ~2 years of commercial experience who can quickly master new technologies, frameworks and has lots of love for Linux, DevOps and automation. 

For the past year I have been working on a blockchain project as a part of a small team (<10 people). I have been involved both in backend development (creating Python microservices using Flask/aiohttp/Tornado frameworks, implementing new features, fixing bugs, writing unit tests) and in infrastructure/automation (administrating servers and databases, containerizing microservices, building CI/CD pipelines, deploying to Kubernetes, setting up centralized logging with ELK stack and monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana). This has been a great experience as it allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the project architecture, which I later applied together with our team and our senior architect to identify and rewrite flawed parts of the project. As a team, we applied best practices to increase code quality, improved overall performance of our backend & frontend and covered more code with tests to ensure quality of the product.

Prior to this, I have worked on multiple freelance projects in teams of 2-3 people, where I used Flask framework and PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy to build website backend and deployed it to production, while also doing some Python scripting to automate mundane tasks for the team and our employer.

On my future projects, I would like to continue growing as a DevOps engineer, while being involved heavily in both sides of the coin – Development and Operations.
Currently looking for a flexible full-time DevOps engineer or Python backend developer job to further develop and apply my professional skills, gain more experience and work on exciting projects as a part of a team. Would prefer positions with no ""legacy"" code in use and relatively modern tech stack (unless you actively aim to upgrade or replace it)."

I used to be a software developer for 13 years, so I can understand and soothe the developers’ pain.

Nowadays I'm a “DevOps engineer"" (I prefer to call myself ""systems engineer"") working closely with developers helping them automate, monitor, operate and optimize the whole software development process. 

Some fancy buzzwords:

CentOS, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows Server, Docker, Ansible, Graphite, InfluxDB, Grafana, Riemann, CI, CD, Teamcity, Gitlab CI, Concourse CI, Nginx, HAproxy, and so on. 

You can find more fancy buzzwords in my skill list below.
I really value healthy relationships in the team and well-established processes. If you have no such processes I can help you build them :)"

Fuck this: ""15 years of experience in installing security systems (video surveillance, security, fire alarm, access control and other low-voltage networks), I am also an IT specialist in building and maintaining local & wireless networks and various network services and server solutions (racks, linux/windows servers, vmware, proxmox, veeam, routeros, pfsense, openvpn/wireguard, web/voip/mail servers, etc.). 
My work was structured in such a way that I was a manager and an installer in one person: receive a task from a customer, examine an object, calculate volumes, estimates, make a plan in AutoCAD - after agreement, make a purchase, put into overalls and go to the installation. More than two hundred objects built from scratch. These included shops, offices, recreation centers, cottages, government organizations and several grain terminals. In parallel, I created and maintain a dozen terminal servers (Windows 2012/2016/2019) on a remote hosting (hetzner.de) and various hypervisors, where almost 50 people work every day for five years.
I am an absolutely independent crisis technician, you can send me alone to any object where there is a problem and be sure that I will find it and be able to fix it, be it a software/hardware/network or logical trouble.
As a separate direction, for a number of clients I provided technical counterintelligence at their enterprises - I regularly searched for wiretapping and hidden cameras, developed a device for automatic monitoring of radio broadcasts (VHF,UHF) 24/7 in order to uncover potential covert surveillance of the object, I had special technical means to search for bugs. Customer focus, boundless patience and tact. I feel the technique intuitively, because I had to understand the energy, mechanics and logic (PLC), as well as the logic of my predecessors. I develop, design and implement my own automation and security solutions in hardware (including 3D printing, soldering, programming). Extensive knowledge of the operation of various electronic systems helps to solve any problem. ""

Software engineering:

My GitHub contains projects what I've to work with, but not all of them, in my experience pocket: Python, Go, Ruby, JavaScript. But mostly I'm a Python developer. I have good experience in writing installation tools around most various cloud providers(AWS, GCP, Azure, BareMetal), Alerting systems e.g DeadMansSnitch(have own implementation), as well as a bunch of experience with ChatOps implementation. I don't stay in the same place and growing my programming skills every day and every minute, basically my final goal - it became 100% pure developer.

Technology list: Python3 

Cloud platform software engineer:

Developing a multi-cloud platform installation tool as a unique solution that allows customers to build and deploy all necessary infrastructure components including sensitive security components and sophisticated networking topology. Monitoring and logging solutions were included and optional(can be enabled by the operator before installation procedure), all components suppose to be running on the production environment which means main infrastructure components are highly available and can be extended automatically.

Hi, I am Junior DevOps Engineer well-versed in delivering comprehensive AWS Cloud solutions, I hold esteemed certifications, including AWS Certified Developer Associate, AWS Certified SysOps Associate, and AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. My expertise encompasses a wide spectrum, ranging from proficient Kubernetes practice – underscored by both CKAD and CKA certifications – to adept utilization of diverse Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies, including Terraform, Ansible, and Cloudformation.

My programming acumen shines prominently, with substantial experience in crafting robust solutions using Golang and Python. Moreover, my mastery extends to the strategic implementation of pivotal tools - My prowess includes the construction of resilient CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins, alongside the skillful orchestration of multifaceted microservices deployments through the versatile capabilities of HELM.


Trainee DevOps Engineer (at Infuse Media)
 (March 2022 - August 2022 )
============================================
Revamped monitoring practices by implementing Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes clusters, achieving a 50% reduction in incident response times and enabling real-time performance insights. Additionally, orchestrated a comprehensive monitoring system utilizing DataDog and AWS CloudWatch for the entire AWS Cloud infrastructure, resulting in a 40% decrease in mean time to resolution (MTTR) for critical incidents and ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency across various services.


DevOps Engineer (at AUTOMAT-IT)
 (August 2022 - Present )
============================================
Utilized Kubernetes for orchestrating a microservices architecture and integrated Helm for streamlined deployments. This approach yielded a 60% improvement in application scalability, a 75% reduction in update-related downtime, and a 50% increase in deployment frequency. The seamless scaling, Helm's templating, and efficient rollouts significantly bolstered system reliability and deployment efficiency.
 Implemented CI/CD pipeline for a complex application, resulting in a 70% reduction in deployment time and a 200% increase in deployment frequency. This allowed the team to deliver features faster and respond swiftly to customer feedback.

devops,"The sequences (scripts, pipelines) providing the delivery of  the made project (e.g., webpage: static, Ruby, NodeJS) to web-server, in the following sequence 'PC - Repo - (Webhook+Jenkins or Bitbucket Pipeline) - Target (EC2+Nginx-server, existing or preliminary created with terraform or awscli)'  + DNS + (SSL or Let's Encrypt).
I like to use Docker (+Compose) for some solutions and familiar with multistage build, e.g.: in GitHub: .../v-ch322/petclinic.
Recently I wrote experimental routine allowing to use Ansible in inner docker-compose net with SSH-client and SSH-server. Ansible (from SSH-client) installs Nginx and copies static webpage to SSH-server. This example is in GitHub: .../v-ch322/docker-ssh-ansible. It my mind it allows making certain  preliminary experiments with Ansible without internet use.
I began to study skills concerning DevOps approximately two years ago. A degree of acquired level of above-presented skills , in my mind, corresponds to  junior specialist level.

I have no practical commercial experience.

Junior DevOps Engineer, Perkskit MMC (Remote)
August 2022 - September 2022

In my role at Perkskit MMC, I functioned as a Junior DevOps Engineer, focusing on user administration and password policy management to ensure optimal system security. My responsibilities encompassed creating, managing, and deactivating user accounts aligned with organizational needs and policy.

An essential part of my role involved budget control and management, implementing strategies to optimize IT spending and align costs with business objectives. My proficiency in financial management contributed to efficient resource allocation, positively impacting the organization's bottom line.

My tenure at Perkskit honed my skills in various AWS services, including EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, EKS, ELB, and EFS. I utilized these platforms to enhance the operational effectiveness of the organization, streamlining processes and reducing costs. My expertise with AWS led me to create an EKS cluster to facilitate seamless container orchestration, improving application deployment and management.

I was also responsible for deploying multiple applications on AWS, enhancing scalability, security, and reliability. My efforts ensured high availability and fault tolerance of our application infrastructure, significantly improving the customer experience.

Junior DevOps Engineer, Opsteameyes LLC (Remote)
October 2022 - Present

Following my tenure at Perkskit, I joined Opsteameyes LLC, where I continue to build my DevOps skills. I have been instrumental in maintaining and configuring pipelines on Azure DevOps, improving CI/CD practices and ensuring the consistent delivery of high-quality software.

One of my notable accomplishments has been configuring a serverless Jenkins environment, allowing for more efficient resource management and enhanced scalability in our CI/CD pipelines.

In my current role, I've expanded my skillset to include infrastructure as code (IaC) technologies, working extensively with Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. These tools allow me to automate and standardize the setup of infrastructure, reducing errors and increasing efficiency in deploying and maintaining the organization's IT infrastructure. This experience has significantly contributed to my understanding and implementation of best practices in IaC and cloud services.

I have practice with MS Azure, Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Git, Azure DevOps, Kubernetes etc.
"
devops,"I'm passed Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certification (AZ-900).
Before working as a DevOps i worked as a System Administrator for 2 years.
Currently I'm finding in Poland, in Katowice city.
I am a DevOps Engineer/System Administrator with 2 years of experience in Azure Cloud and Networks. My expertise is mostly building infrastructure with Terraform on Azure, *nix administration, and building CI/CD pipelines. I have good communication and personal skills. Quick learner.
"
devops,"To highlight a few notable achievements at my previous work, I successfully upgraded an internal mission-critical core bare metal server that ran a legacy Ubuntu LTS system and made a number of architectural changes in the process:

* Migrated a multitude of various VPN services with overlapping subnetworks and routes to dedicated, per-VPN service LXD/LXC containers with OpenZFS file-backed storage. 
* Configured a policy-based routing to enable interoperability of isolated, overlapping VPN subnetworks and host's networking.
* Implemented a backup, restore and disaster recovery processes utilizing native zfs send/receive functionality. This particular solution allowed for a flexible and rapid restore of individual containers and entire LXD container hypervisor with a very low MTTR.
* Improved storage layout (software RAID and LVM) by clearly defining roles and assigning logical volumes for use with services running on the host.

I was also responsible for instilling a structured and well-organized process for handling regular application updates for one the firm's clients. In this project, I'd been brought on to help development team to conduct regular application data updates and had been handed poorly documented deployment instructions, which with time I turned into a highly detailed, accurate, up-to-date, repeatable, step-by-step deployment guide. I introduced a well-structured process for managing and conducting these regular application updates by designing a workflow for a ticketing system to track the deployments and their results.

I also developed and maintained PostgreSQL snap packages which was an employer-sponsored Open Source project. I had the privilege to join Snapcraft Summit 2018 and hack on the PostgreSQL snap packages with Snapcraft developers at Canonical's HQ in London.

I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Linux Foundation Certified Linux System Administrator.
I am an aspiring DevOps engineer with some of the required experience and skills already under my belt. I'm actively learning to fill in the knowledge and skills gaps and I would be thrilled to join a team of DevOps professionals as a Junior DevOps to learn the craft through hands-on experience.

I have rich experience (over 10 years) in system and network administration accumulated over many years of work in several domains: consulting, software development and ISP.

From bare metal to virtualization to cloud, I love working with infrastructure and specifically to design and implement new architectures.

In general, I love to build stuff but I also get a kick out of continuous improvement of existing systems and processes alike, as well as ensuring everything runs smoothly and coherently.

At my previous job, a firm offering white glove consulting services to various clients in North America and EU seeking to improve performance, reliability and design of their PostgreSQL deployments, I was responsible (among many other things) for automating all sorts of deployments with Ansible from databases (PostgreSQL) to monitoring services (Zabbix, icinga2), to provisioning new cloud instances (AWS EC2), to managing storage (physical and cloud), DNS (Route53 and BIND), networking, firewalls, routing, to deploying regular application changes and configuring centralized logging for Docker containers, to contributing to an Open Source project and so on.
* Looking to join a team of DevOps professionals in a company with a nurturing environment that enables continuous professional development and career advancement.
* Clearly defined career growth path within a company.
* Clearly defined job responsibilities.
* Competitive compensation.
* Timely payments and regular compensation reviews.
* Flexible work hours and hassle-free approval of days off.
* Competent management.
* Professional relationship built on trust and mutual respect."

devops,"
I gained extensive experience with advanced features of monitoring tools like SumoLogic, Datadog, and PagerDuty. I successfully improved my work with these systems by:

    SumoLogic: Analyzing logs, writing different queries, creating API integrations, making API requests, and setting up data collectors.
    Datadog: Creating metric-based and events-based monitors manually and through Terraform, configuring event notifications via SNS subscription, implementing API integrations, enhancing dashboards, and utilizing various features.
    PagerDuty: Utilizing PagerDuty as our primary monitoring system to receive alerts from different sources (SumoLogic and Datadog). I gained a solid understanding of the PagerDuty infrastructure and even described it using Terraform.

Additionally, I enhanced my proficiency in AWS by implementing different solutions, working with various AWS services, improving my bash queries while investigating EC2 issues, using AWS CLI for different tasks, and learning how to create requests to AWS resources using APIs and SDKs.

Furthermore, I deepened my understanding of the Okta infrastructure by transitioning from manual operations to automating processes using API requests, enabling efficient automation and handling various events.

I expanded my skillset by learning Python for scripting purposes and gaining proficiency in working with the boto3 library, which enhanced my ability to automate tasks and interact with AWS resources programmatically.

Moreover, I successfully resolved many access issues for team members, including granting access to specific AWS environments, managing access to the corporation and AWS VPN, and addressing various other access-related challenges.

Additionally, I improved my skills in Git for version control. I utilized Git to track and manage code changes, collaborate with team members, and ensure efficient project development.

Lastly, I worked with Jira and Confluence, where I managed and created tickets, set OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), and created and edited Confluence articles, ensuring efficient project management and knowledge sharing within the team.

I initially started my career when I was still a schoolboy with small freelance projects (simple websites, development/modification of firmware for Android).

Then, after entering the university (at the moment I graduated from it and am a bachelor of cybersecurity), I started working in the field of technical support for various products (applications), as well as services provided to the end client (connection and support of ISP clients).

After that, I tried myself in various fields, including to gain practical experience in areas that affect my education. And I still take part in volunteer (unpaid) projects, such as translation from one language to another in Steam.

Throughout my career, I have acquired the skills of Python scripting and Bash, working with various monitoring systems, working with clients, a full cycle of working with requests (Jira, OTRS, for example), analyzing logs (TrafficServer, Nginx), managing a team (5+ people), assembling servers/CDN, administering telephony and related systems (3CX, VOIPTime, Asterisk), developing technical documentation (SLA), administering specific equipment (HP LPO) and software (Verimatrix, for example), as well as various operating systems (Windows, *nix) and others technology or software.

I have over 14 years’ experience of working in the IT industry and 10 of them as a DevOps engineer with Linux stack. During that period, I managed to work in different directions and tried several roles related to product infrastructure support. I started as system administrator of Linux servers including work on items related to operational engineering activities. In terms of software implementation, I have great practical experience in creating scripts using Bash, rarely Python. I find those languages as a great instrument to automate daily routine processes, simplify the lifecycle of an operational process.

I have spent most of my time on customer support service, design and implementation of cloud solutions, and provision of business critical advisory and guidance for corporate customers. Technologies I have used are Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Azure, Linux.

Currently, I am working as a junior DevOps Engineer, and looking for hands-on opportunities to improve my skills in Prometheus, Kubernetes, SQL, and AWS. Also, I am seeking opportunities as a Linux Administrator.
"
devops,"The product in the design and development of which I participated was awarded by the European Commission in the BOWI competition as one of the best Ukrainian products in the Industry 4.0 category. And the company received a European grant for its development.
I'm a skilled IT and Industrial Automation engineer with development and administration skills and with over 12 years of experience in Linux and Windows environments. I have experience in building internal IT infrastructure and develop applications for Industrial Automation. Outstanding ability to adapt to a changing IT environment, quickly learn new concepts and apply knowledge effectively.

As system administrator I worked with various systems, beginning from bare metal servers up to cloud infrastructures. I have experience with 3 node Proxmox cluster, and FreeNAS based ZFS storage (with zfs stream replication to remote system). I am maintaining IT infrastructure for company with ~50 employee (head office) and 1 remote location (VPN bridge to head office). AD, DHCP, software installation automation, integrating external systems via LDAP: gitlab, Rocket Chat, mailserver, odoo, etc.
I also operate with video surveillance systems, access systems.

As software developer I have experience with supporting old legacy industrial system (Originally developed using Visual Basic 6), modernize it with C/C++ modules. Also I participated in the development of the control system of seventy tons bunker scales. I develop HMI using C++ and Qt Framework.

I designed and was a backend developer of a complex cloud system for monitoring and optimizing the work of industrial production.  That is based on the principles of Industry 4.0 and IIoT. (Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, influxdb, Grafana, MQTT, AMQP and etc.) On this project I also gained experience as a DevOps engineer: terafform, kubernetes and etc.

In previous projects, I have been custom building OpenWRT (and buildroot) Linux systems.  Created automatic installers (and ISO images) based on debian and ubuntu (also with live mode). For technical support, I built VPN networks and packaged client software for these images. Also I operate MeshCentral system ( Open Source self hosted system, similar to TeamViewer).
I would like to grow as a software developer in a product company, or extend my sysadmin skills as a DevOps engineer."
devops,"The main achievement is ability to perform multi-functional role in the team at a high level including researching, implementing technologies, architecting new infrastructures, troubleshooting and refactoring existing ones, managing and correcting junior specialists' work and automating DevOps processes  including IaC and GitOps full and partial implementations where possible
I have 6 years experience of deploying highly-available solutions based on Kubernetes. Due attention is paid also to security aspects of system, such as multi-layer hardening (based generally on CIS, but not only).

Also i'm writing and optimizing Terraform modules, Ansible roles, Helm charts, deploying service mesh (mostly Istio, but can be exclusions) into Kubernetes cluster(s) and/or VM(s).

Generally solving any other cloud-native based task, including ones with SysAdmin/DBA nature, DevOps/SRE nature etc.
I DO NOT want to do routine work which can't be automated and any work which does not related to my specializations regardless on the payment. I prefer remote work, hourly or one-time projects, also can continue supporting them after."

"
devops,"Certifications: GCP DevOps Professional, GCP Associate Cloud Engineer, Terraform Associate, Python Brainbench, CKA, AWS Solution Architect Associate
Two years ago I finished DevOps Crash Course at SoftServe company. 
While studying I worked with AWS.
After finishing the course I got the offer to join one of the on-call teams in the Center of Excellence as Trainee DevOps (later becoming Junior DevOps and recently Middle DevOps) on GCP project. 
In fact it is mostly Ops or Cloud Infrastructure Support work. The project has no CI/CD. Our team as L2 Support is responsible for alerting and monitoring (native GCP) and processes user-submitted tickets. We have on-call shifts, roughly one week a month.
Work on the project leaves enough time for study, self-education and experimenting on our educational projects. 
I have GCP DevOps Professional, Kubernetes Administrator, Terraform and Python Brainbench certifications (and we don't have Kubernetes on the project).
My English level was evaluated as upper-intermediate-low.
I am allowed to leave the country because I have a disability which doesn't affect my ability to work and in fact is barely noticeable.
I am looking for a position on which I can refine my present skills or learn new ones.

devops,"When my past project was in the POC stage I, had to build a complete CI/CD solution for our .Net Core application based on Jenkins and Azure Cloud. I had a couple of weeks to do so. Worth noticing that I never worked with Jenkins or Azure cloud before.
During my employment, I was a member of different international teams. 
I worked closely with Azure Cloud past 3 years. My main responsibility was to create a CI/CD platform from scratch based on Jenkins and deploy environments based on containerized .Net Core applications hosted in WebApps, along with other infrastructure solutions like:  Azure Functions, SQL databases, Storage accounts, CDNs, VMs and Service Buses to Azure Cloud using Terraform.
Also, I worked with AWS, deploying various services using Terraform. Services included: S3, Route53, VMs, CloudWatch, FrontDoor, ECR, ALB.
I was a key DevOps engineer on the project, from the beginning, where I was building infrastructure on my own, till now where I am leading a group of skilful colleagues, who are working hard on modifying and implementing new solutions to this infrastructure. Now I am a Lead DevOps on the project, I work with a team of 4 DevOps engineers, one of them is from Mexico, so sync-ups with foreign colleagues is something I worked a lot with.

Introduction to Programming Using Python
My last project i deployed geo Openshift cluster and developed migration plan microservices. For this project, I deployed Openshift, Gitlab CI/CD, Nexus, Ceph Cluster, Haproxy, Gitlab Runner, Ceph Client in each datacentor. i was build microservices using s2i.I also have experience with Kubernetes. For automation I use python and Django/Rest Api. I needed to sync data between Openshift.Yes In ceph there is RBD for disaster recovery.but RBD as you know Block device level. This solution didn't work for me because the data was synced too late. because of this delay, my backup plan was disrupted. To implement this plan, I needed lossless asynchronous data replication. For this solution, I wrote a script to each haproxy server and got the statuses of the servers in the haproxy backend. I then converted this script to the rest of the api service in Django, at this time the backend was raised, when it was, the service returned 200, otherwise it returned 504. I only needed this solution to properly check the backend servers. Then I mounted ceph clients in each data center to each other and wrote a script with python class logic in each data center and listened to requests from haproxy every second. Thanks to this script, the data was synchronized as soon as the microservice in the Main Center went down. When it came to the Backup Center, it was synced from the Backup Center to the Main Center. You might think, what if the system suddenly fails? To do this, I mounted an additional 1TB disk for each client and replicated it asynchronously. At the time of the collapse, data was synced to openshift from this spare drive, and the drive was backed up daily. it was my brief devops journey

I possess over a decade of experience within the IT industry,  extensive and robust expertise in the realm of Linux-based systems engineering and I've dedicated the last 5 years specifically to my role as a DevOps engineer. During this time, I've achieved significant milestones and completed noteworthy projects/products.
   
Within the realm of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) successfully orchestrated the entire infrastructure by leveraging a managed Kubernetes cluster. The complete provisioning of both GCP and Kubernetes resources was orchestrated exclusively through Terraform. 
To further streamline operations, I automated the deployment process of microservices using custom Terraform modules. Additionally, I  employed Helm charts for deployment third-party tools and applications.
I skillfully set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes for microservices on Bitbucket.
Configured Monitoring system using Prometheus stack ,  Alertamanger and Grafana. Used Kong for Ingress, Linkerd for Service Mesh , cert-manager for certificate management.
Besides I effectively managed and supported clusters with Istio Gateway and Istio service mesh integrations.

I utilized Terraform to provision an AKS cluster within the Azure environment. For the Continuous Integration (CI) aspect of the project, GitLab pipelines were employed to manage application workflows. To ensure efficient and automated deployments to Kubernetes clusters, Flux CD was integrated into the process.

In order to tailor Kubernetes objects to specific requirements, I employed Kustomization, thereby implementing a structured and adaptable templates mechanism. Alongside Kustomization templates, Helm templates were also utilized to further optimize and streamline the deployment process.

Currently I am diligently expanding my expertise by delving into ArgoCD, a powerful GitOps tool that streamlines deployment workflows. Additionally, I am deepening my understanding of Kubernetes policy templates, which play a crucial role in ensuring compliance and best practices.

At the present time I am helping small teams and projects to do their DevOps better:

- Plan and setup GitLab, groups, projects (Git-repositories), permissions, merge flows.
- Write and support pipelines (mostly using GitLab CI) for building, testing and deploying apps with or without Docker to Kubernetes and classic environments.
- Start and maintain services for the software development team: GitLab, Jira, Confluence, Rancher, Sentry, Grafana etc.
- Plan, provision and maintain infrastructure on-premise (bare metal) or in the clouds like Azure or AWS using technologies like Ubuntu Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, NGINX, RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, Metabase, Alerta, Sentry.
- Implement Infrastructure as Code approach using SaltStack, GitLab, Python, YAML etc.

As a software engineer I enjoy automating things, writing pipelines and code for ops like provisioning, app deployment, backup, monitoring etc. I like to design data structures to inventory and manage hardware and software, to seek for the patterns that help to avoid bottlenecks and increase repeatability, minimize the human factor and configuration drift.

- Improved developer experience by introducing a self-service platform using Backstage, providing engineering teams with a one-stop tool for creating, monitoring, and troubleshooting their services.
- Coded internal tools and services in Python and Golang, such as CLI, CI/CD tools, Kubernetes operators, and Prometheus exporters.
- Mentored and trained developers on Kubernetes and Terraform best practices and DevOps methodologies.
I seek opportunities in a Kubernetes-centric cloud environment that leverages modern industry-standard practices, such as Infrastructure-as-Code and GitOps, and employs up-to-date tooling. I avoid working with legacy software, on-premise infrastructure, and tools like Jenkins and Windows.

In addition, I value efficient time management and prefer to minimize the amount of time spent in meetings.

I am prioritizing collaboration with companies aligning with my values and principles. As such, I refrain from engaging with organizations with a track record of conducting mass layoffs or those that have ceased hiring initiatives in Ukraine."

I've been living in Ireland for a long time and I'm planning to return to Ukraine soon. So, just looking if there is any job for me in case I'm not conscripted for military service.

I worked in AWS for the last 5 years mostly as a Java developer. However, in Amazon every engineer is kind of a universal soldier, so I did everything there: from what people usually call a DevOps job (IaC, CI/CD, etc) to classic Sofware Engineering (working on new and old features, operations, oncall duties, etc).

When I lived Ukraine I worked mostly as a DevOps engineer in various companies. I have 10+ years experience and worked with a plethora of technologies. There is no point to list them all here. It'll be easier to just share my CV if you are interested. I'm a quick learner and can pick up any new technology or a programming language fast (or brush up on my old knowledge).

Obviously, no companies that have russian or belarus teams / offices.

Piece to everyone.

I am an enthusiastic, fast learner software developer and DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer. I have been introduced with computer science when I was 12 years old and been very interested in that field since then. I have tried myself in many fields including embedded development, game development, mobile development and so on. At the moment I feel myself at best with Software Development and DevOps/Site Reliability Engineering fields because it involves creative and critical thinking to solve problems and overcome challenges.
I have used many tools as SRE/DevOps and willing to learn more. I don't think differences in technology stack is a big deal as I've stated before, I am a fast learner and it will only take me a short while to adapt to new tools.
I also do fair amount of operation work and development while trying to balance them. 
After work I enjoy spending time with my friends, playing videogames, playing with my guitar when I’m in my mood, learning new things (anything that catches my interest). I enjoy good music and find it refreshing to go to music festivals.
I am not a huge fan of operations work but operations work once every while is a must to keep things refreshing. Overall I'm fan of balance between operations and automation tasks and I try my best to turn operation tasks into automated ones when possible."

devops,"In April 2017 started a small company branch in Sumy for a company with HQ in Berlin. Contractor since 2019, building great products solo and with my teammates.

In 2020-2021 as SRE helped a video hosting platform to remain stable and grow from 1M to 2M ARR while CTO was transitioning out of the company (over 10 million video plays per month serving about 30TB of traffic per month, dynamically distributing it with the help of 3 different CDN platforms).

Implemented a new scalable and dockerized infrastructure for one of the German market leaders in travel which has 3M EUR MRR.
Since 2020 working as a DevOps with GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform and all the fancy tools, Docker deployments and GitLab.

Until 2020 worked mainly as a backend developer. It's become a pretty hard task to remember everything I've been working with since 2011, but the key point is - I'm constantly and eagerly learning new stuff. In December 2020 started working as a backend dev in a video hosting company, and over time transitioned into the SRE/Tech lead role as their CTO transitioned out of the company. I'm working as an individual contractor since 2019, with my previous employee and with new clients from all over the world. My current stack includes Symfony 4, Laminas, React, Next.js and Meteor/Node, and this is the direction where I would like to develop my skills further. Most interesting part of my working life was a year of 2016 when I'd been working on a startup prototype with Meteor framework, and the following 6 months or so, when I switched to React/Redux stack. Also, as a part of my additional responsibilities in a company, I was involved in the infrastructure development - trying different deployment practices with Jenkins, Docker, Ansible etc. Before that I had over 2 years of experience with Symfony2 stack (which continued in 2018 with Symfony3/4), ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ on a big high-loaded project. I use Linux (previously MacOS for 1.5 years) in my everyday working- and server-life (Debian and Ubuntu), and git of course. Earlier I worked with Zend Framework 1.12 (for 1 year) and CodeIgniter (2 years), using Liquibase, Redis, php-resque scheduler and RequeBoard; also coding some js tracking code and testing it with Jasmine. Prior to that I worked with CodeIgniter and some custom frameworks, and did HTML/CSS freelancing since 2009 or so. Trying to contribute in opensource projects on github when I have time. Occasionally learning other instruments when I have to (Python, Go, Node.JS)
After several years of attempts to build an own product inside my current company, I'd like to join a team that already has one. I would like not only code, but participate in product development at full scale (e.g. be involved in some decision making or have some things to decide on free will). Open to leading a team or taking more responsibility than a regular developer, but also comfortable working in stand-alone mode."

devops,"Two achievements I value most:

1. I have developed and implemented transition of services from Xen virtual servers to clusters of OpenVZ containers long before Linux containers became mainstream technology. By tuning OS memory overcommit and OpenVZ memory settings I have been able to decrease costs of running bare metal hardware 3 times, because transition allowed to run 3 times more client services on same hardware.

2. I have been engaged in helping with one of the busiest Magento websites in the world. It was running on AWS. I suggested changes to Redis server configurations, TCP stack settings on EC2 instances and configuration changes to Percona XtraDB cluster. These allowed to increase application throughput in 2.5 times.
I came to Linux and OSS world out of curiosity and few years later my hobby became a profession. Since then, I have been working with Linux based server infrastructures and open source software in software development companies for more than decade already and have been doing SRE/DevOps most of this time, well before these terms even came to existence.

Over the last few years I have been working as Site Reliability Engineer / Linux Systems / Cloud Infrastructure expert around helping clients with resolving infrastructure related application performance and reliability issues, prepare and implement application migrations from premises to cloud, build and improve Kubernetes based microservice app oriented infrastructures, CI/CD pipelines and monitoring.

Looking for a project where I could meet my experience in solving issues with new challenges and enrich it. I'm pretty good in building/improving/managing Linux server infrastructures but want to become better. Looking for remote full time long term contract or relocation to US.
I am particularly interested in cloud/hybrid infrastructures, Kubernets / Hashi Corp stack, Terraform, Python/Golang, GitOps.

I can work well in startups as well as in corporate environments, as long as I work with smart people, using Linux and open source software and tools.

devops,"- Increased stability of the service I maintained
- Automatized the heck out of everything, so I could spend more time learning other stuff
I’m enthusiastic and ambitious sysadmin and Linux guy willing to try himself in DevOps area (although I don't mind continuing system administration if an interesting project is offered). I'm professionally doing admin stuff for almost 2 years. Always eager to advance my skills and push myself forward, I find my current job (not sysadmin job in general, but my current position) limiting my professional growth and generally boring, routine and unsatisfying. And stagnation is probably one of the most depressing things for me, so maybe it’s your company who will save me from this routine and help me in my journey to future careers. So what can I offer?

- Strong Linux knowledge
- Strong shell scripting skills (bash/sh)
- Command line fluency
- Configuring Apache, nginx, OpenVPN, Let's Encrypt's Certbot and other server software
- Moderate network knowledge, understanding of OSI
- FreeBSD
- Knowledge of virtualization systems (KVM, Qemu, Oracle VirtualBox, libvirt)
- Some AWS experience (Route53 DNS, EC2, RDS, aws-cli)
- Building software from source
- Familiar with Docker
- MySQL
- git knowledge
- Ability to automate things: I believe that if some repetitive task can be automated in a robust fashion, it should be automated
- Familiar with Ansible
- Nagios monitoring system
- Windows Server 2012/14
- Currently learning Python
I'd like to:
- gain experience in DevOps field
- automate things
- optimize operations
- work with modern technologies: cloud, containers and other fancy things

I'm reluctant about:
- maintaining office hardware and do other boring things
- building office network
- often working with Windows"

User training
I have huge experience in help desk\service desk\technical support. I gained most of the experience working for the one company. The company developed and grew, and accordingly its IT infrastructure grew and improved. I was directly involved in this process.
The state of multitasking was permanent and it is not a problem for me. In most cases it was necessary to solve problems independently. Which did not cause any particular difficulties, given the analytical mindset, the ability quickly find the necessary information, the ability to learn easily and of course stress resistance, thanks to which I was able to control myself even in the most stressful situations. I have never had problems communicating with people. However I learned to be more responsive in communicating with customers, which together with my good sense of humor allowed me to take communication to a new level. Regardless of what position the person occupies in the company - office manager, department head or business owner - I can find a common language with anyone.
Summarizing all of the above, I can say with complete confidence that I have vast practical experience in:
•	Deployment and configuration server components, both Windows and Linux, such as AD, GPO, DHCP, DNS, MS Exchange, WSUS, KES, other acronyms, Apache, Nginx, mail delivery systems, antispam systems, Asterisk, etc. As well as configuring active network equipment.

I`ve started my path from helpdesk role in banking area,   with providing L1 support to bank`s staff, L2 support to network adminsitrators, maintaining local-hosted windows servers.
After that moved into IT monitoring area in companies where 24\7 monitoring and customer support was required. 

Been working in processing center having partnership with 80% of the all banks in the country, and 95% of the total market. It were in my responsibilities as a monitoring engineer and duty administrator to provide 24\7 monitoring on Linux(CentOS and RHEL) and Windows servers, MSSQL and PSQL databases, fixing issues(if it was in my power to do so) or contacting responsible system engineer in time; performed maintenances, and planned server updates, manual software installs, had little experience with Ansible; e-commerce part of the work was analysing VISA and Mastercard logs, tracking transactions, finding issues and informing financial department about it.
Also, I performed huge works with documentation (creation local wiki for the company) and checking and clean up things before the audits.

After that I have been working in an international B2B company, providing 24\7 monitoring on fintech products in more than 15 countries around the globe and support to our business partners - calls, meetings, communication during issues and critical accidents on both sides.
Monitoring the product included big amount of work with MSSQL database, writing queries and creating templates for my colleagues; analysing services logs, and investigating the issue before providing information to L3 so they can find the source of the problem.

Currently I am working for a local company which is a leader in its field with loyalty and digital marketplace products.
Looking for a job that would help me to develop my skills, and myself as an professional.
