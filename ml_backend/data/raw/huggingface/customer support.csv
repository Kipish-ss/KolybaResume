At Mobfox had the main task of increasing the spending of demand-side partners. Profit from these partnerships increased 5.5x times during the first six months and doubled in the next six months. 

At Gravitec.net negotiated and supervised the company's launch on the new marketplace.
Lead Gravitec.net to the finals of Vestbee's Startup of the Month Challenge.

At Radugar, created a single comprehensive report for all primary company's KPIs.
At Bizzclick I am completely focused on managing both supply and demand side partnerships as tasks are split between the team members clearly. Mainly I was completing analytical tasks on partners' performance, communicating with them on a daily basis, and working on the ad-hoc requests. 
All the work is in the in-house platform. 
For custom development tasks and their further monitoring used Jira, and for daily tasks - Trello. 

At Mobfox my primary responsibility was managing 
and optimizing demand side partners.
But also had to complete ad-hoc tasks on monitoring ad quality, assessing spending on 3rd party services, and onboarding new demand and supply partners.
For custom development tasks and their further monitoring used Jira, and for daily tasks - Trello. 


At Gravitec.net I spent 40% of my time working with new and existing customers + 60% on business development projects.
The main responsibilities at the company included customer onboarding, support, developing a strategy of using the product + fundraising, linkbuilding, and affiliate marketing.
Experience in lead generation of both potential customers and potential partners.
Mostly used G Suite, ClickUp, Slack, Miro, Reply.io, and Trello.
Assisted with launching a new company's product called Piar.io with similar responsibilities.


At Radugar (or RIMarkets) worked as a Data Analyst.
My main tasks were data visualization, creating financial and management reports for the company's executives and team leads, and updating CRM. At first, we used Power BI but management decided that Excel visualization would suffice.


I am looking for a company with transparent professional growth. The most experienced in client-faced positions but looking forward to working with data and business analysis.

Note. I didn't leave Mobfox for Bizzclick, it is contract employment from a company I can't disclose i.e. I work at the same company since August 2021.

customer support,"During my time in Ring I worked as the alpha tester for the new project for Amazon, collecting, sorting and analyzing various data, identifying ways to improve the workflow and suggesting solutions for future project development, plus creating reports based on the gathered data.
As a Customer Support specialist I responded to tickets through emails; solved customer's issues in live chats; would troubleshoot multitude of technical issues; directly communicated with customers regarding product availability requests, refunds, order confirmation, status and shipment updates, etc.

My psychology degree helps in dealing with a multitude of issues in a professional, calm manner, while most importantly remaining empathetic and positive. 

I'm a fast learner, having myself used multiple customer support platforms before, such as Kustomer, Zendesk, Freshdesk, and it takes me very little time getting used to a new one. 

I am also very familiar with the Stripe and Spree platforms as I have used both extensively, directly solving customers inquiries regarding product refunds, payment confirmation etc. 

In my line of work eighty percent of my time was spent troubleshooting a variety of technical issues, from internet browser problems to step by step product setup. From hardwiring to setting up subscription plans, I was able to help even the most technically inexperienced customers to get the most use out of the product they have purchased. 

I am an experienced user of PC based computer systems Windows/ MacOS with a C2 level of spoken English and B2+ level of grammar (last evaluation on 09/30/2019).

customer support,"
I’ve started my way to the IT world by doing small steps from being an agent of online 24/7 support. I have gained a great piece of experience by not only chatting with people and helping them to solve their issues but also by “hearing” them and their needs. This is where I got the understanding of empathy and how to apply it to know people better. 

It helped me to build a team of agents who provided top-notch support 24/7 and could act like human beings without bot scripts. I decided to move forward and became a customer success manager whose main goal was to provide additional value to customers. This period of time was the boosting one, as I wanted to be a part of the product, to deliver value, and to make people find their “aha” moment within our product and features. That boosted me towards the product management courses where I got to know each and every part of the process precisely.
I want to be a part of world-changing products, work with a team that is dedicated to the result, and motivated to release the project by all means. I prefer a dynamic environment, instead of a routine day-to-day work life where the next day is the same as the previous one."

customer support,"I was instrumental in the creation of a Customer Care Department at one of my last jobs, and my contributions resulted in a more streamlined and efficient system for handling customer inquiries. 

Specifically, I developed communication guidelines and necessary instructions for employees, added a contact form for customer convenience, introduced a CRM system for better request management, and implemented a chat feature for quick communication on the platform. 

Additionally, I helped to develop a bot for social media that provided instructions to clients. And improved communication between departments using Slack and Notion.
In my previous role as a Customer Care Specialist at SkyEng, I completed projects and tasks related to answering customer questions and communicating with them via phone, instant messengers, and email. I also worked with CRM, ticket systems, and telephony to manage customer inquiries, performed information analysis and feedback, and resolved negativity and refunds. During this time, I developed strong customer service and communication skills, as well as proficiency in the technologies and tools used to manage customer care, such as Unisender, Helpdesk systems, Slack, Sendpulse, and Figma.

As a Customer Care Manager at RollerAds, my role was expanded to include managing payments, sending letters to clients, answering customer questions, and managing negativity and refunds. I continued to work with CRM and the ticket system and performed information analysis and feedback to improve customer satisfaction. In this role, I also developed new guidelines for employees and connected new services for work efficiency.

In my current role as a Customer Support Representative at Tango Me, I work in an online live-streaming application where I respond to user requests in chats, assist in moderating broadcasts and violations, respond to comments, complaints, and questions, and work with the QA team to solve technical problems. Communicate closely with the finance department to resolve issues and prepare instructions for users and employees.

customer support,"Implemented SWOT-analysis.
Got a $330000 monthly profit because of the supply-chain managing inside the department of 5 people.
Team efforts achieved a contract from Uber Freight and Amazon for an exclusive delivery lane.
A decreased retention rate of employees of one of the clients.
I started my way as a logistics customer support representative in 2016 right after my university dropout. Worked with US/Canada/Mexico customers. In 1 year I was promoted to Fleet Coordinator and started not only providing customer service options but also getting new contracts and new load opportunities from the clients. I had a small team of 5 people and our team usually worked with big US customers such as Uber Freight, Amazon, and SpaceX, our main goal here was to provide the best possible service and the fastest options to deliver them freights. 

After it, I decided to move forward to get new experience and develop myself as a manager, and was hired as Operations Manager (also in a logistics company). I was involved in hiring/training/termination processes, created employee development plans, worked on guides, and implemented new features that might evolve us as a company. This company was closed by its owner because he decided that this business is not interesting to him anymore and I was hired by an outsourcing company after it. 

I wanted to move away from logistics and made my horizons wider to be able to gain more experience. I worked with 5 US projects inside the administration team of an outsourcing company as a Customer Success Manager. My main goals were upselling, team development, and new clients onboarding, I also worked closely with Recruitment, HRBP/HRPP, Finance department, guiding them on my own projects if needed. And at the same time, I worked with my own teams on the projects.
Catching the ""red flags"", working closely with clients to develop their own strategies, fixing any escalations, distributing the workload between employees, and working on the reports - this was my daily routine.

Also, I tried to switch to Project Management and started to work in a digital agency for half-time but because of the war agency decided to stop providing the services and struggled without new clients so we part ways. 

In addition, I tried myself in a game development studio as a Team Manager of a 3D Team, worked there for 3 months but the studio decided to not close my probation period. But I got a recommendation from them to start my way as a Project Manager in gamedev - which is at least a good point in this case

Currently, Im looking for Customer Service Manager/Team Manager/Project Manager positions and want to grow as a professional in this way.

Also I`ve been working as Managed Services Manager  in American company (WiseTREND - Advanced OCR & Dara Capture) for 2 years. I`ve worked on several projects that a related to FCA, education and healthcare using some ABBY`s software. My responsibilities are: 
- verifying the accuracy of the data and fields captured using advanced capture software;
 - posting and tracking document exceptions;
 - matching documents and codes;
- reviewing and organizing customer forms and then processing them as needed.
Now I`m looking for a job where I can have interesting challenges, career growing and ability to improve my skills and the company product. I have solid analytical skills, good sequential thinking and excellent communication skills so I would like to work on a manager position like customer success or support

customer support,"I consider leaving the office job for a freelance to be one of the big achievements. The reason is that I was not prepared to live a ""free"" life and was not aware of responsibilities, decision making, time management, self-encouragement and many other perks of a freelancer life.
I have extensive client communication experience. 
As a freelancer, I deal with clients' questions, requests, and occasional complaints. I learned how to be professional and treat people with respect and be calm in situations where the client is rude and inadequate. I understand the difference between ""human"" and stone-cold corporate language and attitude and how it can affect the course of the conversation and work.Before I started to work for myself I did not realize how miscommunication can hurt the end result. I learned about asking specific questions to uncover what the client wants and needs since the majority don't come with detailed technical tasks or briefs. I learned from my own mistakes that talking is vital for both clients and me. It can facilitate, put things in order, discipline, and sometimes act as protection when clients start to ""turn the tables"".I have been freelance since March 2018. Before that, I worked on international oil and gas projects as a Structural Designer for 5 years. My work involved 2D and 3D designs of engineering structures. I also have actual call center operator experience - 1 month and I am familiar with Zendesk software - I took a short training.

Developed speech, typing skills and the use of daily used computer softwares. Mainly I would say I have developed mentally due to associating myself with people of different calibers.
My work experience stretches from Crimea where I worked as an English tutor from 2013 September to 2015 May as I decided to move to Dnepro to continue with my studies.

My first 6 or so months moving to Dnepro I did not have any job. I was later employed  as a sales agent for an American based merchant cash advance company as of 2016 to January 2018 from 4pm to 1 am. I was an outgoing phone operator, presented or offered cash to high end businesses which they would pay back in a specific allocated time frame. 

Worked as a customer support agent as of February 2018 to May 2020, working a 2 on 2 schedule. Here I helped out clients with questions about our product, thus including incoming and out going payments and the use of the services as a whole. Resolved customer questions or complaints, handling out and incoming calls, emails and chats assisting clients and gained experience in softwares like CRM, confluence, service desk, Jira and other softwares.
To learn new aspects and develop myself as an individual in life. Mostly I value respect and appreciation of efforts of any individual.
I look forward to explain more on how I can be part of the team and what we can both benefit upon knowing sphere of business."

In 2017, I took third place at the national K-1 competition in Kyiv, and in 2018 I took second place in Zaporizhzhia.In 2019, I participated in the UCU Summer English Language School, where I received an award for active participation.

"
customer support,"I had been studying English even before I entered elementary school, thanks to which I am now fluent in it. I graduated from my gymnasium with a gold medal. While studying there, I was actively participating in numerous Ukrainian, English, German, Physics, Math and Programming contests, competitions and events held between different schools. My best result was 2nd place in the regional stage of the English ""olympiad"" back in 2019-2020. In my gymnasium, I also received intermediate knowledge of the German language.

When I was about to turn 5, I started taking extra courses for English, which lasted around 11 years, until me and my tutor decided that I didn't need them anymore. Afterwards, I switched to Mathematics courses, which I was attending for 2-3 years until I graduated. Nowadays, I study at the Zaporizhzhia Polytechnic National University.
I do not have any work experience, however I have plenty of knowledge in terms of helping people and working with computers.

I have been familiar with PCs since I was 5 years old, which was when I developed an interest in working with Microsoft Office software. Some time later, I switched to other programs, such as 1C, and eventually began learning how to code. Nowadays, I am a confident user of such programming languages as lua, С#, C/C++, GML, HTML and CSS. Naturally, I have good computer and internet skills too, and I can quickly adapt to software and tasks which are new for me.

As for experience relevant to customer service, I spend a good portion of my spare time helping newer users with the things I described above on various forums and social networks. I try my hardest to not only figure out a solution for their requests, but also to provide a thorough explanation for why their problem had occurred and why my solution works. I am *very* patient with people and I always give it my all when it comes to working with them.
On the job, I would love to have the opportunity to combine talking to new people, helping them and using my computer knowledge as well as English proficiency. I prefer to work with clearly defined objectives, but I am also ready to show some creativity if necessary. The ability to obtain some new skills would be greatly appreciated. Both day and night shifts are fine."

customer support,"Being a great customer support representative is about having a combination of strong product area knowledge, excellent communication skills, and a commitment to providing outstanding customer service.
In my previous role as a customer support representative, I learned a lot about the importance of effective communication, problem-solving, and customer service. One of the most important aspects of my role was communicating with customers in a clear and concise manner. This involved not only using language that was easy for them to understand, but also listening carefully to their concerns and questions. I found that by being patient and empathetic, I was able to build trust with customers and help them feel confident in the solutions I was providing. Another key skill I developed in my role was problem-solving. It was my job to identify the root cause of the issue, troubleshoot the problem, and develop a solution that would resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Even when dealing with difficult or frustrated customers, I remained calm, professional, and focused on finding a solution that would meet their needs.
Overall, my experience in customer support taught me a lot about the importance of effective communication, problem-solving, and customer service. These skills have been invaluable in my career and have helped me succeed in a wide range of roles in the tech industry.

In my role as an IT Technician/Support, I have completed various projects and tasks to provide efficient technical assistance to users. One notable project I worked on was the implementation of a centralized helpdesk system to streamline the support process. I collaborated with the team to assess user requirements, select a suitable helpdesk software, and configure it according to our needs. This involved creating custom ticket categories, automating ticket assignment based on expertise, and setting up knowledge base articles for self-service support.

Additionally, I have handled numerous troubleshooting tasks, ranging from diagnosing software issues to resolving hardware failures. For instance, I successfully resolved a complex network connectivity problem by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the network infrastructure, performing packet captures, and identifying the root cause. I then implemented the necessary changes, such as reconfiguring network switches and updating firmware, to restore network functionality.

Throughout these projects and tasks, I have utilized a variety of technologies. For helpdesk management, I employed a popular software solution that offered ticket tracking, escalation workflows, and reporting capabilities. In terms of troubleshooting, I utilized network analysis tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, as well as remote access tools to provide assistance to users in different locations.

I am responsible for coordinating support activities, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring timely resolution of issues. I actively participate in team meetings to discuss ongoing projects, share knowledge, and propose improvements to enhance our support services.

As an IT Technician/Support, I am committed to continuous improvement. I aim to enhance my technical skills by staying updated with emerging technologies and industry trends. Additionally, I am working on developing my communication and problem-solving abilities to provide even better customer service. I actively seek feedback from users to identify areas of improvement and explore ways to optimize support processes, such as implementing new tools or refining existing workflows.

Overall, my goal is to deliver efficient and effective IT support, proactively address user needs, and contribute to the overall success of the IT team.

customer support,"I never treat things like personal accomplishments, I just do my job and take it for granted. But probably I'm just being harsh on myself.

Used to have warehouse jobs for 4 years, but thankfully that stage is now over. What started simply as a means to get money (because otherwise I had all day everyday completely free), unfortunately dragged on for way longer, than I would ever prefer it, for all sorts of reasons.

But luckily I managed to get a Customer Success Representative job not too long ago and I can't be happier about this shift of things.

I worked in a ""paper-writing services"" company with German and English languages. I was the only employee who could deal with the German language so that I was responsible for:
- working with the customers (chatting, emailing, phone conversation) that have placed the order;
- checking the paperwork that the writer has provided us with;
- looking for the writers that could provide us with academic paperwork (the database was almost empty, so I was searching for them on my own on different freelance websites);

After getting a degree in the translation of English and German languages, I started my first job as a Customer Care Agent at Productech company that develops and distributes portable electronics.

Hello! I have 1,5 years of overall experience in Customer Support activities. 

My journey has started with an outsorcing company AddSalesForce where I occupied a position of Customer Support Agent for a popular European second-hand marketplace platform. As a Customer Support Agent I had to process all user's requests assigned to me automatically by a ticketing system in the form of tickets or live-chat and create new templates for replies to users. I had been working in this company for 6 months when the project was closed and my first job experience had come to an end. I learned how to deal with a great amount of work and proved to be stress-resistant, I improved my time-management skills and met daily goals on time.

My next stop was Adavice - an online marketing company where I stayed for a bit more than 1 year. I gained a position of Support Manager in their affiliate marketing team. Our team provided users with mobile content (games, recipes, health, downloads through popular portals) and also dealt with CC Submits. My main duty was, of course, processing user's requests which was done by email. My other responsibilities were: creating new templates for replies, processing fraud prevention alerts, prosessing chargeback reports, representing incoming chargebacks, performing some QA activities such as making sure our portals function as expected, they contain relevant information, QAing logs of real users to make sure the subscription flow works as expected and if not, reporting it to our product team.
As of now, I'm looking for a place where I'll have more opportunities for both personal and professional development and growth. 

I expect to work remotely with a standard (9-18) or flexible schedule. I would not like to assist customers by phone (emails, chat, live chat only).

I will not agree to work night shifts."

In my role as a Retention Manager and Logistics Specialist at Vista Holding, I effectively communicated with drivers and support staff, collected data on driver service trends, and implemented strategies to retain drivers. I also managed transaction schedules, maintained inventory records, and oversaw fleet maintenance programs.

I provided prompt and accurate responses to customer queries, analyzed product malfunctions, and resolved customer complaints. As a team leader, I conducted hiring processes, managed payroll and benefits, and ensured adherence to company policies.

With strong analytical thinking, organizational skills, leadership abilities, and effective communication, I bring a positive attitude and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

Hi everyone!

As of now, I have 2.6-year experience working as a customer support engineer in Ciklum for the Powtoon company. 

Throughout this period, I've been improving my communication skills on a daily basis, both oral and written, handling internal communication within a company and external with business customers. Besides, I developed the problem-solving skills, as this is what the sphere of IT support demands. 
Learning how different teams interact within an IT company - is another crucial skill that I acquired, as I frequently had to interrelate and negotiate with the DevOps, Product, CGA and other teams in order to solve some problems and achieve the specific goal.

Previously, I've worked as a teacher for 3 years. It also helped me to develop strong communication skills, to improve my planning and organizing skills. Besides, I learnt how to find a specific approach to customers in order to build long-term collaboration.

customer support,"
I've been working since around 16 years old. My first jobs were all part-time gigs, including bartending, waitressing (often combining both) at local pubs and bars, copywriting and translating texts and articles both from and to English. Due to the general volatility of this experience, I am not including the time I spent working part-time as my ""Job Experience"".
As of right now, my occupation is a full-time Customer Support Agent in Billing Department. After joining Customer Support with no prior experience I managed to get promoted to Billing Specialist in less than 5 months.
My everyday responsibilities include: 
1. Processing and resolving all incoming requests from our customers (calls, chats, emails) regarding payments. This includes, but is not limited to declined payments (why? how? what should I do?), refund requests, and communication with the banks of our customers. 
2. Processing and resolving chargebacks/disputes we receive for the payments made by our customers. 
3. Being on the lookout for possible fraudulent activity. Locating and refunding payments made with stolen cards, etc. 
4. General company activity - attending team meetings, proposing ideas, improvements, and possible solutions to issues at hand.
As you can guess, every live request has a chance of evolving or changing the subject, so I am also required to be well-informed about our general procedures, workflows, product updates, and be able to resolve any exceptional situations, no matter how difficult or convoluted they may be. 

As every interaction I have may include substantial financial risks, I believe my swift promotion speaks volumes about my reliability, adaptivity, focus, and devotion.

I am more than ready to work in completely new industries and try to explore something different.

I am looking for the project that will allow me to grow. And also — to contribute my knowledge, skills and expirience for making CS better in all things that matter. 

My perfect match is a project that deals with self-care and development, health&beauty, travelling or education.

Yet I'd like to avoid working with phone calls and on night shifts. This will keep my mental health and energy up, so I can be much more efficient when working with email/chats/tickets/etc. during the day."

Thank you for looking at my profile."
customer support,"Increased demand for the use of crypto projects such as Essentia and Defiyield, due to shilling on social networks and a marketing campaign on YouTube.

Successful management and development of own Discord's shilling group.

Creative ideas were generated for site development, which were implemented by the developers. 

Rapid introduction of new employees into the workflow.
I have working experience on two crypto projects called Essentia and Defiyield. 

The first one is an universal platform that manages all crypto things. For example, this project is available for staking, farming, deployment of Super/Mars nodes for accumulating tokens, as well as it has an application (crypto wallet) with which you can manage more than 750 integrated tokens and coins, including the most popular. I was responsible for carrying out shilling (distribution of the project) on social networks (telegram, twitter, discord), as well as engaged in a marketing campaign, namely the involvement of YouTuber influencers to advertise that project. Also, there is little experience of moderating chat in Telegram.

The second project is in the same area of Decentralized Finance. There is already a portfolio of crypto assets where you can track your investments, ratio of your profits/losses, statistics, etc. Moreover, there is a dashboard that shows the accumulated amount of various tokens kept in liquidity pools, you can check your own transaction history (namely their approval), you can use a tool for quick verification of smart contracts of other projects. In that case I have experience in shilling, managing and controlling my own group, creating and maintaining documentation for the workers, carrying out online meetings, interviews and introducing a new person to the work process.

There is also a modest experience of solving tickets in Freshdesk, in a company called M2E. M2E has developed its own product, namely an extension for the Magento eCommerce platform. This product served as a link between the platform to multiple marketplaces such as eBay, Amazon, Walmart.

At the moment, I have a great desire to work in the support department, because I see myself in this field and I want to gain experience for a perspective path of development.
I expect a collective friendly atmosphere, projects on interesting topics (crypto, web-hosting or just something related to IT) and invaluable knowledge in the field of customer support. 

I would not like to execute call services (I would prefer live chat, mail tickets or something like that) and do not want to deal with direct programming in any form."

With a good command of the English language and strong customer support experience, I will be fitting perfectly in areas where these skills will be most useful.

•I have made the main indicator of the quality of the work of agents not TTS but FCR. As the result, agents began to focus on providing the most effective solution to the client's problem at the time of his first contact. Whereas in the past, agents tried to respond to the request as quickly as possible and take the next ticket, which badly affected the quality of the response and the client had to contact again, which increased the workload on the department. The change in the motivational system has increased CSAT by 10% and reduced the workload on the department by 17%.

For example, as a result of daily efforts, one of my clients recommended my agency to her former colleague and later she became our new client. At first, this new project was led by my colleague, but after the client asked me to lead it. 
Also, I had a client whose 2 projects were managed by our company and 2 projects by our competitors, after several months of work, the client transferred these 2 projects to my company. And when I told this client about my dismissal he said that his company had decided to bring one more project to our company.
So for me, daily good work brings excellent results from a long perspective.

- Have had around 60 students joined the company after my demo classes (WingoKids, Beijing).
- Added 40 new companies as regular clients (Autoline, Ukraine).
My first full-time job was as a B2B sales manager at the international Online market Autoline. My responsibilities were to call businesses from the United Kingdom and Czech Republic and offer them advertising their used vehicles on our web-site. I have been working for this company for a year and I signed 40 companies as our regular clients. 
After leaving Autoline I moved to China, where I have been working for 3 years as an English teacher. First, I worked in a big tutoring company WingoKids in Beijing. I was giving private classes and developing individual teaching program. The main goal I achieved was signing around 60 new students after a demo class and having more classes than average.
The last 2 years I spent in Shanghai working for a famous international school Helen Doron. I've been working as an English teacher as well. The spread of COVID-19 happened during my first year at this company, so I adjusted teaching program and was giving Online classes.
Recently, I came back to Ukraine and now I am looking for a job as a customer support manager, because I want to use my English at work and I want to build a career here, in Ukraine.

My previous job involved handling chats and writing tickets of various types. The work was done through CRM systems like LiveChat + HelpDesk and previously Zoho. Player inquiries varied, including issues with deposits, bonus discrepancies, betting problems, technical issues, general casino-related questions, and more. I am proficient in using Chrome extensions to streamline support work, such as using shortcuts and automatic translation for non-English chat conversations.

I find support work itself very interesting, and I thoroughly enjoy this profession. I feel comfortable working in this field, and I have a genuine passion for it. At my previous job, I was interested in career growth. However, the conditions of the VIP Manager position did not suit me, and there was no need for a supervisor at the time. I have a strong desire to continue growing professionally, and I believe that was the main reason for my departure from the previous company.
I definitely don't want to work in an environment without clear deadlines or where the CRM system crashes every half an hour. I am ready to deliver high-quality work and I'd like to work in an organized and stable environment. I'm not interested in a job where there is a strict hierarchy, and new support agents are treated as outliers. That's not cool and doesn't align with the supportive community spirit of support professionals."

By providing effective solutions to customer inquiries, I helped to reduce the number of complaints and negative reviews.
As a support agent, I was responsible for helping customers with their questions, and concerns regarding a company's product. My tasks included answering customer inquiries via email, or chat, troubleshooting technical issues, providing information about products and services, processing orders and returns, and escalating complex issues to the shift supervisor or QA team. 

Regarding technologies, I typically used various software tools to manage and track customer interaction, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and knowledge bases. 
I also use communication tools like phone systems (JustCall) and live chat software (Intercom, Grammarly) to effectively communicate with clients.

I had experience as Customer Support Agent (L1 Support), simultaneously working on 5 projects. They included chats and inbound/outbound calls, tickets etc. Also, I got experience in mentoring.

I have been a Customer support manager and a Pro Customer Specialist for more than 4 years. Problem-solving and working under pressure are my cup of tea. My main task is providing omnichannel support via chat or email, the infromation I give the customer: - where the order is; -informing the additional infromation about the desired product; helping the customer with the return procedure; - finding the most profitable solution for both sides in a short time since the chat aim is to help the customer asap. 
I am the right-hand man of our customer support supervisor. My main task was to find out how we could motivate our customer support managers to provide our clients with better service. Also, I helped with making different presentations, courses, and surveys. It is vitally important to me to keep studying new things and improving my skills. At this stage of my life, I would like to share with other customer support managers my experience and help them to provide the customers with the best service ever and make them walk away with a positive interaction with the company.
"
customer support,"As an Account Manager's Team Lead, I built a team of 14 strong Account Managers on a brand new project within the company and created all the general flows and procedures their work was based on.
I have been working as a support team member for about 4 years, and my path started back in September 2017, it was an IT company the gave me the most significant experience in different positions. 

September 2017 — December 2017 - Customer Support Representative
- assisting customers in chats / over the phone (both outgoing and incoming calls) / via email;
- introducing / advising on company product;
- resolving minor issues / complaints customers may contact support with.

At the end of December, 2017 I got a promotion and joined the Shift Managers' team.

January 2018 — September 2019 - Shift Manager
- assisting support team during the shift;
- taking control over all the processes, taking care of any issues (including technical ones, by reporting them to the relevant parties);
- communicating with other departments in regards to customers' issues or support team's needs;
- negotiating over the phone / in chats / via emails with customers.

And I was lucky enough to get another promotion, to the Account Managers' Team Lead position. 

October 2019 — May 2020 - Head of Account Managers' Team
- hiring and teaching new account managers;
- managing and organizing the workflow;
- implementing and structuring the internal procedures for optimizing AMs' workflow;
- preparing comprehensive monthly-based performance reviews; 
- analyzing the daily/weekly/monthly statistics for department strategy purposes.

At the present time (since June, 2020), I work as a Senior Support Agent / Product Support Team Lead for another IT company - it was my decision to apply for a Support Agent position, so I could learn the new product and grow in this company.
As a Support Agent, I work with incoming requests from the customers (chat, phone, email), advise them on our product, work with their objections or concerns. 

As a Product Support Team Lead, I manage a team of several support agents that support a special product within the same company. I'm involved in the onboarding of the new members and providing feedback to the Technical Team and the product developers regarding the product performance, customers' complaints and bugs detected. 

However, since there have been no open positions and there is nothing new I could get from this company or nothing I could give it in my current position, I am in search of a job that would give me more responsibility and opportunities to improve my professional skills, as well show myself as a leader.
I hope to find a company of strong and motivated professionals, with a position that would let me master my skills and gain new knowledge. 
It would be wonderful to work for a product company and I prefer not to be involved in sales or Forex."

Providing excellent support and exceeding customers' expectations is my true passion. I'm a hard-worker, honest and dedicated person.

Throughout these years, I've honed my abilities in inbound/outbound call handling, chat support, ticketing system (Zendesk), and rapport building. As a supervisor, I was helping my colleagues in finding solutions to more complicated cases. Then, as a Leader, I became responsible for a 10-15 people team. 

In my Customer Support Manager role, I've learned how to handle difficult conversations, give feedback, manage up, and, most importantly, influence the people I manage without authority. My customer service, people-centric nature, and compassion have afforded me excellent interpersonal skills that probably top the chart of my strengths.

customer support,"
From a past year experience, serious electricity issues are expected in Ukraine this fall. That is why I would like to mention that my laptop handles 10hrs of active screen on a single charge, so I have no issues working on shifts.  

At the moment I have almost 3 yrs of experience in a customer support. 
I've started from working as a customer support manager in an online casino back in 2020. It was a pretty tough job, as on my position I were working with regular players who are often the angriest and the most annoying. The Q1 of 2020 also was a period of global lockdowns so online casino's traffic was growing significantly and support service was constantly overloaded with incoming chats and emails. Despite the fact that the job was pretty hard, it helped me to understand all principals of successful and stably-working online casino.  It gave me a strong understanding on how does customer support team work, how does it cooperate with financial and security departments and how should organizational structure should look like to ensure the stable work of all online casino. I worked in this position for 8 months before quitting. 

2 yrs ago from now I started a new position with a company where I am still employed.. 
I started as a customer support manager on an e-commerce website. At the beginning I was the one of two persons who were working in the team (the support service was not 24/7 due to a lack of inquiries). The platform was growing quickly so after 6 months of working I was promoted and entrusted with creating an effective 24/7 customer support team. 
On a new position, I've trained new team members, measured their effectiveness and making sure that everything works stably. My duties also involved creating weekly reports for a top management about quantity of inquiries and overall effectiveness of the team.

I have extensive experience in customer service and support roles, which have allowed me to develop a strong skill set in managing customer interactions and leading teams. Here is a summary of my customer service experience:
From March 2016 to March 2018, I worked as the Customer Support Department Manager at Cloudbeds cloudbeds.com SaaS compamy. In this role, I was responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the support team, setting goals, managing performance, and fostering growth among the coaches. I established a culture of operational excellence, ensuring that our team consistently provided the best possible resolutions to customers while meeting our Service Level Agreements (SLAs). As the point person for any issues or concerns, I addressed support team members' needs and provided guidance during shifts. I also prepared action plans, enforced quality customer support standards, and resolved any departmental issues or problems. Additionally, I prioritized my team members' career development, learning, and general well-being by delivering frequent feedback and coaching. Managing customer escalations and engaging in creative problem-solving were also part of my responsibilities.

During my tenure at Cloudbeds, I actively participated in the interviewing and screening process of new coaches, ensuring that we brought in qualified and dedicated individuals to the team. I was also responsible for resource allocation, including managing time off, scheduling, and ensuring adequate shift coverage. I had a keen eye for identifying trends in support and strategically adjusting manpower to meet the team's needs, often collaborating with teams in other locations for joint projects and initiatives. Creating and enforcing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on individual and team performance was crucial in driving productivity and success. Furthermore, I took a hands-on approach, answering escalated calls and tickets alongside my team members when needed.
I have experience as a sales assistant at Payall it's a SaasS Fintech company payall.com, where I actively engaged in cold calling and processed incoming inquiries through the website. I also utilized various strategies, such as LinkedIn and email marketing, to identify potential clients and generate leads.
In terms of sales tools, I am proficient in using sales CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce. 
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.

Besides, in case of any issues my agents experienced with a customer, I was a Closer and handled the cases further by myself.

The work was based on tickets handled through Zendesk where I had correspondences with multiple customers by answering their questions, providing instructions, investigating their issues, reporting them to other departments.

The last workplace was in the IT company dedicated to Online Gaming, in the Customer Support team providing customers with support and assistance based on the company’s products. Worked as a Senior Customer Support Representative.

Hi!
I'm looking only for remote job now.
I see myself in the following areas - customer support/verification management, journalism, lead generation, SMM. However, I am ready to consider other offers besides sales/betting/gambling. This is definitely not mine.

It is very important: my level of German is B1+, English is between Pre-intermediate and Intermediate (this is sufficient for correspondence and chats, but I do not feel confident when talking on the phone with English-speaking clients). However, I am ready to improve my language skills. As practice has shown, if you wish, you can start from a lower level. I proved this when I became the team leader of the support department, whose employees worked with English- and German-speaking clients."

Hey, my name is Daria and my first job experience was as a Customer Support Representative in Genesis IT company in Ukraine. I've been there for a year and I think I learned a lot: I was dealing with customer complaints, all in English and did al lot in technical support as well. After the beginning of the full-scale war I moved to London and worked as a waitress in the restaurant and got promoted to a manager after 3 months there. I learned how to organise the working atmosphere, divide tasks between people and help them to build a good relationship to create a nice atmosphere in the workplace. Also i had a project which was connected to customer experience and people  working there which i completed successfully and improved a lot of numbers for the business. Now i moved back to Ukraine because i feel like a want to live and make a career here. So I'd be happy to recieve offers from you that are related to my work experience.
After I worked in a very healthy atmosphere I'd love to have the same here. I would prefer to not work night shifts. The constant feedback is also very important for me as I have a huge desire to grow up in my future workplace and help the company to improve and grow as well."
customer support,"During my time as a Customer Support Representative, I set a goal to consistently achieve high-quality responses while also increasing my reply rate per hour. Through hard work and dedication, I was able to exceed these goals and become a top performer for six consecutive months.

To increase my reply rate, I focused on optimizing my workflow and utilizing automation tools wherever possible. By streamlining my processes, I was able to respond to a higher volume of tickets without sacrificing quality. Additionally, I actively sought feedback from my colleagues and superiors to identify areas where I could improve my response time and efficiency.

In terms of quality, I made a conscious effort to provide personalized and empathetic responses to each customer. I actively listened to their concerns and worked to understand their unique situation before providing a solution. By doing so, I was able to achieve a high satisfaction rate among customers and maintain a positive reputation for our company.

My success as a Customer Support Representative was a result of my dedication to both efficiency and quality. By consistently striving for excellence, I was able to achieve my goals and become a top performer in the team.

I studied, thoroughly worked the whole process of Support and became the head of my department, new, with new responsibilities. After a couple of months of such work, I heard good feedback and continued to work. I also trained new candidates for work in our Support.
The last place of work is a company that provided services for trading on financial markets. Initially, I was a support agent for three years. My responsibilities: informing Polish and Russian clients about verification, assistance in successful login to the account, assistance in setting up a job for autotrading, processing of primary documentation, translation of texts of documents from Russian into Polish, communication with customers in chat and much more. Then, in the same company, under my leadership as Teamlid, a department was opened, the mission of which is to optimize the workflow for the entire Support. So I worked for another two years and recently the company ceased to exist and now I'm looking for job.
I'm not looking for a job as a Conversion / Retention agent. I do not want to sell on the financial markets. I am looking for a job exclusively at Support, in any company, even if it provides services for trading on the financial markets."

customer support,"Certainly, I've achieved significant milestones that I'm proud to share. In recent times, I've completed several valuable courses that have expanded my skill set. Notably, I successfully finished the “Responsive Web Design” course through freeCodeCamp, which equipped me with the expertise to create responsive and user-friendly web interfaces. Additionally, I completed the “JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio” course offered by Zero To Mastery Academy. This experience enriched my JavaScript proficiency and enabled me to build a diverse range of projects that showcase my abilities. Furthermore, I undertook the comprehensive “The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery” course from the same academy, further honing my skills in web development and ensuring I am up-to-date with the latest industry trends. These accomplishments demonstrate my unwavering dedication to continuous growth and my pursuit of becoming a highly skilled professional in the field.
While I don't have direct experience in a Remote Work specifically for Customer Support, I am fully equipped to thrive in such an environment. I have all the necessary tools and resources required for remote work, including a well-prepared home setup. 

My experience in creating projects further demonstrates my readiness. For instance, I've developed a full stack web application called “Face Recognition,” which effectively detects faces in images. This involved using React for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end, and PostgreSQL for the database.

 Additionally, I've successfully completed 20 web development projects in JavaScript, showcasing my ability to independently manage tasks and stay productive while working remotely.

This experience, coupled with my technical skills and self-driven approach, enables me to confidently excel in a work from home environment.
When it comes to expectations, I have a clear understanding of the role I would excel in and the areas that may not align with my strengths. I thrive when engaging with users through communication channels that allow for thoughtful and detailed interactions. I am particularly drawn to supporting users via email, ticket support, or live chat. These methods provide the space needed to thoroughly address inquiries and provide well-considered responses. On the other hand, I might find tasks that involve phone-based customer support or extensive call center interactions to be less aligned with my preferences. I believe that my strength lies in written communication and providing comprehensive solutions, making email, ticket, and live chat support the avenues where I can truly shine."

With a strong background in customer service and a passion for helping others, I am confident in my ability to excel in this role.

As a Customer Support Representative at Supportyourapp Company, I was responsible for handling a high volume of customer inquiries via phone, email, and live chat. I consistently received positive feedback from my customers for my friendly and efficient resolution of their issues.

To start with, I’m a third-year student at the university. By the way, the name is IT Step University and it’s the first uni in Ukraine which specializes only in IT education. Much to my chagrin, I haven’t a commercial experience working on a project yet.
Instead of that, my university pondered a variety of ways how they can bridge this gap, to make students more efficient, compatible and versatile.
I will say, in a nutshell, about the non-commercial experience in the 2nd year, and then I will move on to the 3rd. 
We have a project works, where we should implement a web app or something like a service which will make people’s life easier.
When it comes to talking about my experience, I have worked on Avenga’s project where I was part of a software implementation team. Our dream team creates the coding interview tool which will be used for coding assessments in IT companies to hire the best-fit candidates. I have tackled challenges, communicate with team members and always completed tasks ahead of deadlines. Now I want to add a few words about this year's project work. Here I am a project manager. My task is to submit reports on sprints on time, clearly design tasks in Jira and control them accordingly, as well as meet deadlines. The idea of ​​this project is to create testing on the site platform to determine your role in IT.  After receiving the result, the user can watch a video describing the profession. In accordance, find a suitable bachelor's program on the university's website. It's all cool, of course... But I want to get real experience working in an office and with a team. I am sure that the position of Customer Support Specialist is the best for me now. Moreover, your company was recommended to me by a friend who worked here.
Finally, that’s all.

Speaking of my previous positions, I used to work as an English Teacher and as a Refund Manager in an avia-related company for around a year. As a teacher I (well, predictably) presented lessons, assessed and recorded students' progress, created and distributed educational content. As a refund manager, I used to communicate with various airlines around the world to gather needed data, study the information clients provided me with, and based on numerous factors calculate and process compensation for a cancelled flight. Multiple platforms were used for these purposes.

customer support,"As to the achievements, I am most proud of Companies trusting me with on-boarding of new people, or guiding them when new employees only start their journey.
Also, I am a Premium Instructor on Udemy which brings me excitement and self-actualization.
My job experience has been majorly formed by the three worlds so far – the one of Logistics, Customer Support of an airline and SSL certificates. They have taught me how to deliver (pun unintended), communicate, explain, search, teach and learn. 

Logistics:
- Gained experience in effective communication – you don’t have time for meaningless explanations or reminiscing on the bad day. 
- Learnt business communication – how to talk/write to a customer or how to behave/talk/write  if you are a customer. 
- Dealt with all the aspects of freight transportation:  calling warehouses, processing orders in the system, booking appointments, resolving multiple issues as they appeared while  the freight gets from the point A to B etc. 

Customer Support of an airline:
- Bootcamp to practice all the communication skills I gained before. Plus, got to know how an airline functions.  
- I was handling customer support lines (calls and complaints) in 4 languages (Ukrainian, English, French and the dead one which I don’t use for work anymore or for any reasons whatsoever).
- Used various CRM systems, like Salesforce, Zendesk.

SSL certificates:
- Through these cyber security products I got to get acquainted with  the tech industry which only continues to lure me in.
- Worked with the full cycle of the  issuance of the SSL certificate – from getting of order in the system to fixing issues with domain control validation and “releasing” the certificate to the customer. 
- Got familiar with different domain verifying resources, CA/Browser forum guidelines, worked a bit more with Salesforce.
Given the occasion, I would love to continue growing in this field. Welcoming new opportunities, too, though.

All the Companies I was happy to work with had their own systems designed specifically for the needs of their product, and I had no difficulty in getting familiar with them pretty quickly. I learn fast. 
To me, the work is a pleasure when it is thought stimulating and is contributing to the welfare of others.
I am open to learning new jobs, however, the one thing I wouldn't agree to at this point is a kind of Customer Support where the agent would need to be ""in line"" for 8hrs straight with short breaks of 10 min and a lunch of 20 min. I definitely need more flexibility in the working process, that is in the 8-hour working day. Adding that detail because I wouldn't agree to night shifts either or work day that would start anywhere later then 10 am."

My first working experience as Customer Support specialist started back in 2017 when I joined Namecheap Inc. company as a junior specialist. My working day mostly consisted of working in Live Chat with basic Support requests. Later I was promoted to middle specialist and my responsibilities included working with chats, tickets, full spectre of support requests related to my department (domain names). Additionally, I performed quality control reviews for my colleagues as a separate task and helped my TeamLead with occasional requests.

I moved to the current company in the end of 2020 and occupied position of middle Customer Support Specialist at first. At the project we had at that time, our team was also responsible for Level 1 manual QA process. In one year here I started performing TeamLead duties (creating reports, performance reviews for team members, communicating with leads from client side etc.)

I have several years of experience in working with different Customer Support platforms (Kayako, FreshService, ServiceNow) as well as communicating with other staff members in both russian/ukrainian and english. My current team is distrtibuted around the world, so we communicate in english with each other on a daily basis.

My working experience lies in the customer support field for over 2 and half years and I feel that I am good in dealing with customer’s requests, providing the information based on the FAQ, Knowledge Base. I consider myself to be also strong at bugs reporting, handling complaints, offering alternative ways of resolving user’s issues. I worked approximately 1 year at the position of the customer specialist until I has been promoted to the shift manager role. The new position is also customer related, but includes the wider scope of duties like creating the dedicated presentations and agents training, providing the feedback about the processed tickets/chats (quality assurance part), complaints resolving and assisting the employees with difficult ongoing cases, facilitating the workflow, making the entrance much more comfortable for the newcomers. But I am ready for the new challenges at the moment and want to find a company to build a career putting long-term goals and ready to be flexible due to the changes inside the firm.

Additionally, I have utilised communication and collaboration tools, such as email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and project management software.

The current project I am working on is Training program revamp which means: we developed new Step-In program implementing CJM approach; started developing lessons using authoring tools such as Articulate360 (Rise/Storyline). To organize our workflow, we use the main principles of Scrum framework on a daily basis: use Jira board to track tasks; plan sprints; regular catch-ups (daily meetings); retrospective meetings to analyze what was done and how it can be improved and so on.

customer support,"I entered into my current position as the Senior Account manager 2 years ago with the aims to create the customer support department from a scratch, bring customer service to a new level, and build a team of account managers and freelancers. 

As some of my achievements, I would like to mention: the creation of a business operation procedure for the customer support department, so now all internal procedures are pretty clear and any new person in a company can start to perform their duty guided by this procedure; 

implementation of some of my innovations in terms of serving the customers, such as 3 steps-in-working with the client: 1) a welcome call with a personal account manager and client once the client is transferred to account manager where we double-check client's needs and expectations; 2) mid-term call - to check how all things are going, what needs to be improved, to receive the feedback from the client; 3) preparation of a final report once the term of service is over and all services are provided and checking the feedback and level of customer's satisfaction. This helps build much closer communication with the client and retain it. 

I also launched some absolutely new directions for a company, among them - a direct collaboration with media, thanks to that our customers receive more valuable service in the form of publications about them in media. Now our clients are featured in Forbes, Esquire, L'OFFICIEL, etc. And afterward, exactly this service brings us significant new sales and satisfied clients.

At the moment I have 5 account managers in my team (this is full-time remote workers) and around 15 freelancers (copywriters, designers, SMM managers, PR managers...) whom we brief on a project base. Most of them were trained and onboarded by myself. I want to admit that during my work no 1 account manager quit the job, which describes me partly as a good manager.

Connected CS Team and Business Team so that the company's tone of voice could truly represent the company's values and policies.
Dear Recruiter,

I started working as a Customer Support Manager in September 2017.  For 5 years, I was a CSM, Senior CSM, Quality Assurance Manager, and CS Team Leader. 

For now, I am managing the international CS Team (Chinese-speaking) in a crypto mining company. We aim to provide efficient tech (mining-related) support to our customers in China. 

During these 5 years, I have worked for Ed-Tech, Gambling and Mining projects. My responsibilities included:

1. Communication with customers from China (in Chinese), USA and Europe & handling complex requests;
2. Building and maintaining strong, long-lasting relationships, working on customers’ loyalty.
3. Adaptation, onboarding and mentoring new-comers, off-boarding process for CS team and supply agents;
4. Quality evaluation and assessments, 1*1 meetings for the CS team aimed at improving the quality of the service;
5. Develop schedules, a motivation system within the team, including a personal development plan (moving from Junior grade to Middle, etc);
6. Setting & tracking main KPIs/OKRs; 
7. Creating communication flow between departments to ease and speed up problem resolution and updates exchange;
8. Creating documentation, like CS instructions and notes, product descriptions;
9. Identifying bottlenecks and complex areas in processes, cooperating with teams to find the best solution;
10. Cooperating with the Product Team, took part in hypothesis testing.

In August 2022, I completed a Brand Management course, and am actively implementing the knowledge gained there into the work, for example in terms of communication strategy & tone of voice. Besides that, now I understand how branding works and how important it is, starting from the identification of company’s values to interaction with different TAs at each level of brand development.

I am ready and able to learn fast as well as share my ideas and experience.
I enjoy managing teams and helping to set the processes that would benefit both team and business. I am interested in a position, where besides working with the CS team, I can also apply and develop my skills in process optimization, team management & development, product improvement, and brand development. 

Would like to join a company with transparent & ecological internal policies and growth opportunities where I can both apply and improve my experience and skills."
customer support,"
To begin with, I worked as a Customer Support Specialist for 21 months at Namecheap Inc. Having become an experienced CSR, I decided to move further in the direction of the managerial position since I was eager to lead and drive a group of people to make them grow personally and professionally as well as contribute to the improvement of departmental and company processes. 

Starting from April 2021, I have been working as a Team Lead in the Customer Support area. I am involved in the development of my employees by guiding them throughout the entire career path in the company. Such activities include but are not limited to setting goals and tasks, motivating, assessing, and carrying out performance reviews both in terms of personal and team perspectives.

Starting from May 2022, I have taken over the second team and became the Team Leader of CS specialists from a foreign location (India). Currently, I am managing both Ukrainian and Indian teams and taking part in developing an Indian location in terms of the CS area in the Hosting department.

Along with the Team Leader duties, I act as a Shift Leader as well. I oversee a team of Customer Support Specialists (up to 60 specialists) on an assigned work shift and ensure effective workflow. Moreover, the role presupposes the facilitation of problem solving and resolving conflict situations. Being a Shift Leader, I am an escalation point who communicates customer feedback to the corresponding departments/staff (e.g., the Product team) in order to develop/adjust processes to serve customers better.

Finally, I am also interested in the positions of Project Manager & Project Coordinator. However, I would like to note that I have not dealt with the project management area directly before, yet there are many aspects of my current Team Leader role that correlate with the PM & PC positions. Therefore, I do not see any massive obstacles that may not allow me to master the nuances of a new field. Furthermore, I have a basic theoretical understanding of PM methodologies and project planning and execution stages. In addition, I am ready to learn new material to gain the required knowledge and, eventually, apply them in practice.

customer support,"I had a project where I had to make communication with our client. Previously, there was not quite good relationship and not as much trust, like after I began to work with this client. And as a result, customer satisfaction has increased as well



Also I am proud of myself, because I may quickly adapt to a change and think about solution of an issue if needed. I would say that I am stress-resistant, since 7 years of CS is quite a lot :-)
Had several years in a call center. Working International customers from all over the world.

Worked with ticketing systems like Zendesk, Jira, Helpdesk and have no difficulties to adapt to another one.

Have rich experience in Customer Care and Troubleshooting. Was a team leader of a small group of people (<5), preparing meetings with clients on weekly basis and had close communication.

In all the cases it was both customer and technical support based on the task we had.
For the last 3 years it was IT sphere and the other 4 - customer support via phone.

Used to work with JS, HTML, CSS.
Active Directory, Skype For Business, MS Office troubleshooting, minor network issues, Remote Assistance. 
Have basic knowledge of Java, JSON, HTTP requests.

I have no fear to speak English at all and I definitely feel this strength and confidence in myself.
The most important thing for me is to feel that my work bring success for the team (company) and it makes me happy. I would like to know company news and be a part of community.

I am totally fine with learning something new, since we are learning everyday anyway and without it live could be boring.

Please, do not offer night shifts. I used to work in night shifts and I was not happy about it, even if they could be calm, despite of the activity of American sector."

customer support,"Had my story posted in an italian newspaper. It was written by me while I was in the basement of our stack of flats trying to survive being in the middle of a warzone in Mariupol. I sent it to my friend via the only working cell tower that was about 300 meters away that I had to walk to.
I have some basic experience working with Blender 3d and would love to learn and improve from someone with experience.
Tech savvy, more specifically I'm not afraid of operating computers in a way that's abnormal or requires following a step-by-step guide.
1. Internship at Translation bureau ""Master"" (February 2020 - May 2020). 
Performed translation practice/assisted in translation of legal documents at the office.
2. Freelance translation work at Mariupol' Translation bureau ""Multi"" (late 2021 - early 2022).
A couple of people and I were tasked with translating a performance report on city renovation progress. We did an alright job, considering that we had no CAT tools nor did we have any kind of translation memory save for our group chat.
3. Graphical Assistant (data set processor) at ""MindyTeams"" (September 2022 - Present day).
Processing image/video sets in accordance with requirements set by the contractor.
I want an interesting, challenging job that will encourage and provide opportunities for self-improvement. I'm also looking for a job that's not about ""working X hours no matter what.""
I definitely don't want to spend time working a mundane job. Doing something that requires absolutely 0 problem solving skills, aka ""dumb labor"" makes my soul weep."

In addition, working onsite for several years in the largest tech company in the world, gave me the correct understanding on how great support should be applied on any level of communication with the clients and peers. Due to my experience in diverse international teams, I was able to gain priceless knowledge which is implemented on a daily basis when providing customer support. My interpersonal skills, languages, and background helped me always to adapt quickly to any team and environment.

customer support,"As to evaluating my own progress and experience I think I'm at my best when I get to communicate
with the foreigners, foreign representatives, foreign co- workers and foreign crew in general, bringing
my contribution to it and to the company's headway.
A willing for improvement and self- development is important for the account manager and any
occupation in general, as well as quick learning and a working capacity. Your job vacancy suits me
perfectly because it assumes responsibilities related not only to those of the above, but also
cooperating with the e-mail correspondence. Previous employers liked how I put effort and always got
done with my work in time. In my opinion, I'm at my best, when I get in touch with the foreign
representatives, trading companies and other intermediatory establishments. I am also a person that
is always aimed for the company's headway.
I have a wealth of experience picked up from my previous job occurrences. I have an overall 9 years of experience working in corporate agencies to do with my W flush skills, and overall of over 15 years of experience in negotiation and usage of English language.
In addition, it is important for me to use my English skills in work, as to my own pursuit of self-
improvement.
I have an advanced level of English, level C1, an ability to follow the client's requirements, ability to
find a common language with clients as an intermediary. I also have a knowledge of official letter and
the specifics of communication with foreign employees, foreign representatives and foreign co-
workers; formal vocabulary. I have the ability to express thoughts clearly so that it persuades the
client.

Hello!

My name is Mara and I have more than 2 years of Game Customer Support Experience.

I can communicate with players and clients in English, Russian and Ukrainian languages.

On my second position as a Mobile Games Customer Support, I used to help players resolving issues with missing in-game items, by searching them in Logs, and communicating with Technical Support Team to address more complex issues. I also did refunds, helped with performance issues, game bugs, feedbacks, bans etc.

On my third position as PC Games Customer Support, I dealed with refunds, country changes, compromised accounts restorations, in-game questions, cosmetic refunds, feedbacks, performance issues, connectivity issues, missing files, bug reports etc.

customer support,"1. mAssistance & Premium support
That brought us about 20% increase in revenue
2. Retention 
Refunds decrease as a result of creating Customer Care department that worked with problematic orders (these were also about 20-30% of the total orders) offering clients credit. So by creating a system of such a dedicated support we managed to hold the % of refunds in between 1-2% out of the total amount of orders; not processing the refunds saving money for the company, showing good processing track for the payment pocessing system (merchant) and making our customer stay.
p.s. 
3. Calls
Non-paid orders/forms are very frequent for B2C. I've analysed that we have more than 30% of non-paids by various reasons (you always need to talk to your clients even if you sell a top-notch tech solution). Customer pays for the service and your attention to them. Tested by 10 yrs non-stop experience. I've re-organized the existing sales team having two (later on more) people work on non-paids by calling the clients and helping them fill in the form. We've got that 30% back! 
4. Customer's journey. I was one of the first Zendesk's clients integrating their CRM into the business. That helped us a lot to analyse and classify requests by TYPE and urgently assist our clients and also making the product better by tracking the stat-s and asking for their feedback. We've passed the stat-s to our dev team so that the product got improved immediately.
5. Escalation
While developing a software you face endless product improvement and its compatibility on clients' side. It is important to have the processes being escalated correctly and punctually to all teams (dev, billing, marketing, sales, etc).
IT and Operations professional 14+ years
- Executive search
- Customer success

These are few examples I believe might lead me closer to the point on what areas drive me the most.

And never forgetting that customer is the reason we have a job."

I’m well expertise to adjust automations there in order to ease up the workflow, create efficient canned responses for the most common inquiries, and provide the outsource integrations, such as IG, FB, Twitter, TrustPilot, MailChimp, Tracking Services, and different fulfillment facilities such as ShipStation, ShipBob, ShipMonk. I’ve adjusted the workflow there for more than 50 employees. So the work is done on time, efficiently, and with a high level of professionalism. Things are of utter importance for customers.
The key feature of a successful project is using Project Management tools or so-called Task Platforms. So, for that matter, I have been using Bitrix, Notion, TodoList, and Trello, and I have successfully arranged the perfect and uninterrupted workflow between different departments.

Hello,

My name is Nhuien Tuan My (Mika). I’m writing to introduce myself and tell you a bit more information about my experience.

I’m 27 years old and I was born in Kyiv, but my parents are from Vietnam. That's why I can speak English, Russian, Ukrainian and Vietnamese fluently.

When I have free time I prefer to watch TEDtalks, NETFLIX, also I adore spending time with relatives and friends. Sometimes I like experiencing such activities as skydiving and diving.

Previously, I worked with foreign markets with strong economies like Europe, USA and Asia. These countries attract me a lot. I am able to work in a team and be a leader. I have had experience managing more than 15 people in a team. Working with clients, resolving conflicts, negotiating with partners and making important decisions.

Best wishes,
Mika.

Early 2016 I started as a Customer Support Representative in a web hosting company.
Mainly I worked with domain names, but around a year after starting there, I took over more complicated hosting-related responsibilities. As my additional task in that time I was an infospace coordinator in the department, handling creation and update of both internal and external documentation.

In early 2018, I worked abroad as a Subject Matter Expert (Latin America). This was a brief business trip, for a total of three month.

Since coming back to Ukraine, I passed additional training and overtook the responsibilities of a Team Leader. For around a year I've been managing a team of around ten representatives of different skills, experience levels and background.

In 2020 I've decided to leave and challenge myself at a more tech-oriented position - a Support Engineer at a high-profile fintech company. Since then I've been working as a Support Engineer / Python Scripter / Dev integrator in a couple of Fintech companies.
My responsibilities there were mostly maintaining of client and demo environments - technical investigation of product issues, communication with clients and the Dev team, some Python scripting and general Linux troubleshooting.

customer support,"
Hi, I am Kate! Nice meeting you 

I had been working remotely before it became the mainstream and at the moment I am striving for new knowledge. 
More than 2 years ago I explored the Customer service and during this time I experienced:

- a brand new topic to acquaint myself with, which is trading
- night shifts and stepping out of the comfort zone
- handling up to 10 and more chats simultaneously
- mastering cultural approach and applying it when achieving KPI goals
- tutoring new operators with guidance and instructions in chats 
- monitoring performance 

Support taught me not to take the complaints personally and maintain a healthy balance between empathy and common sense, to do what is expected by the rules and excel at it.
Moreover, after being ""dependent"" on rating, I started giving the feedback myself in my personal life.

Prior to customer care I had been engaged in an educational environment and was providing English classes  with a break for maternity leave.

Among my other skills I can name research, copy writing, flexibility, ability to learn quickly and creativity 

My hobbies include modern cross stitching and decor (my collection can be seen in Instagram _teacher_stiches), SUP boarding, style and fashion, reading and crafts 

Everything I have been engaged in so far has all been connected with using foreign languages and this is the skill that comes to job description by default.
I look forward to contributing my language skills and gaining new experiences!

I can quickly grasp complex concepts (and products or features) and explain those in a simple manner.

Besides responding to incoming requests I also enjoy analyzing and categorizing the incoming flow in order to gain some insights to improve the Help Center or FAQ. All in all, I'm always on the lookout for the latest trends and software which helps in scaling and improving support quality.

I'm an experienced user of ticket systems (FreshDesk, HappyFox), Jira.
I'd love to participate in building support team from scratch as well as introduce NPS and populate tools like in-app FAQ, User Help Center etc."
