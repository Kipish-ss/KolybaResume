In fact, I believe that you cannot ever be perfect in knowing any language you know right now, so that's why I am practicing and improving my level of either human or computer language from day to day because It is so fun and paramount at the same time. 

Provided that I have grasped the basic understanding of C/C++, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, Assembler, Lisp, PL/SQL Oracle, JavaScript, VHDL, Delphi, and Java, I am willing to move on in this fascinating adventure of creative thinking and bits-to-bits constructing of full-pledged arrangements. In the same way, I got the hands-on practice in data structure design and network architecture, so I am ready to put a lot of time into the subsequent practice in transforming myself into a valuable professional and a man with whom you would be curious to talk.

I'm ready to apply for a job with the notes of using such languages as C/C++ and Python. After all, I have the most knowledge and practice in them. However, other technologies aren't strictly forbidden for me cause I like to learn and I am eager to get an invitation, trying to work on a different domain that I haven't been focused on all the time.

For the past two years, I've been working on software development for IoT and robotic applications. Most of my previous projects involved firmware development for microcontrollers from ST, NXP, and AVR. I primarily work on code for the chips based on the Cortex-M processor. I try to make the firmware easy to understand and design it with redundancies in mind in case of a failure.

For my latest project in IoT, I was using the ESP8266 chip. The device had to gather air pollution data and send it to the cloud infrastructure over AWS IoT. For this project, I had to develop a firmware based on FreeRTOS. Because the system had to be power efficient, I wrote my own code for sensor communication. I've also designed and deployed the necessary cloud architecture on AWS and developed the frontend and backend parts of the web interface using ReactJS, NodeJS, etc.

Currently, I work as an embedded software developer on several robotics projects. I primarily develop firmware for STM32 microcontrollers that drive BLDC motors or process sensor data and provide managed access to peripheral devices over the ROS communication system. I also handle the responsibilities of a technical lead for a team that develops software for Embedded Linux for the same robotic platform. During my time on the project, I've had extensive experience with ROS, streaming libraries like GStreamer, WebRTC, Qt Core, and had to set up a CI/CD using GitLab to improve product delivery efficiency.

I strive to deliver stable and maintainable feature-rich software and look forward to becoming a part of a team of professionals with a similar mindset.
I don't want to be solely responsible for PCB design, though I would gladly cooperate with a designer."

In C I wrote two different libraries for managing memory taken from OS (as a part of a course in university): first - based on spliting a big block of memory in two on demand with linking free blocks in their own headers, second - based on splitting the memory in pages (which can be further divided into 2,4,8 blocks) with specific size to align with virtual memory pages at the start to speed up user allocation. Attended a course in university focused on basic linux modules development and debugging. Worked in a team on PoC ""Green Waves"" organized by Global Logic Ukraine. Our team of students was challenged to reimplement a program (already developed by Global Logic) or its part in a few months with their manager and no code or hints from them. The purpose of the project was to create green waves of traffic lights for special vehicles (like an ambulance) on demand. We used git for cooperating and version control, Trello for tasking. We also had some elements of scrum like regular meetings and sprints. The main technologies included Python and GCP.

My biggest pet project is a coursework on Casino, the first implementation using the console, and the second using Windows Forms for GUI. Also did a lot of different laboratory work, which is not only related to C++
I really don't know a direction that would really appeal to me. That is why I want to try myself in several interesting directions for me."
c++,"
My career in C++ began at Bet Construct, where I worked as a game developer using QT for the client side and C++ for the backend side. From there, I moved on to Synopsys Armenia, where I worked as a QT developer and used C++ for the server part of our projects. After my time at Synopsys, I started working at Fortra Armenia on the InterMapper project, a network monitoring project. In this role, I use C++ for the backend side and Java for the frontend part.
"
c++,"I participated in a hackathon which was related computer networking. I developed a script which automates the tagging version process which was taking about 1 hour. Now it take about 5 minutes. I reworked open source isc-dhcp server for customer requirements.
My first experience was regarding C++ Qt development. I was working with GUI for IP phones. After that I was relocated to another one project and I'm still here. I'm working with firmware for Wi-Fi routers. On this project my skills in computer networking have increased a lot as well as skills in Linux. On this project I faced many technologies. For example a lot of Wi-Fi routers have GUI so I had to learn JS, HTML and CSS. Several times I had to write some Bash and Python scripts. Sometimes I had to debug the Linux kernel to understand where the bug was. Often I had to explore how some network protocol works and made changes in our software according to standards. I got very wide general experience in computer science. My general skill is C/C++ so I want to find work in this area.

Hello! I am an embedded systems engineer with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. My journey started at the prestigious University of California, Riverside, where I honed my skills in programming on Atmega microcontrollers.

During my academic years, I had the opportunity to work on fascinating projects that have shaped my expertise. One of my most notable accomplishments was creating a Smart Cruise Control system, integrating OpenCV for road sign detection with a cruise control mechanism using Finite State Machines (FSM). This project showcased my ability to blend computer vision with control systems effectively.

At my first job, I spearheaded the development of a model rocket release system. By analyzing data from various sensors, the system autonomously ejected payloads after the model rocket launch. This project solidified my proficiency in real-time data processing and decision-making.

My skill set extends beyond the realm of traditional embedded systems. I possess hands-on experience with Software Defined Radios (SDRs), opening new possibilities for communication applications. Moreover, I have undergone multiple trainings in CUDA programming, mastering parallel programming for GPUs, as well as RTOS training that involved Embedded C programming on ARM microcontrollers.

Additionally, I successfully developed a back-end for drone ground control station software. The project demonstrated my ability to work on complex tasks and effectively integrate multiple components.

Currently, I hold a managerial position, which speaks to my leadership capabilities and time management skills. However, I am eager to complement my managerial role with hands-on C/C++ development work, and I am actively seeking remote opportunities to achieve this goal.

If you are looking for an innovative, driven, and adaptable embedded systems engineer to join your team remotely, I would love to connect! Let's collaborate on exciting projects and make a difference together.

Looking forward to embarking on new challenges with you!

I did my PhD studies at CMS experiment at CERN, on the data collected by the Large Hadron Collider.
Before switching to Industry, I was working as physicist for 9 years. I analyzed huge amounts of experimental data in order to find rare and interesting events. 

As the Software developer, I was a part of a cross-functional team (code + unit/functional testing + documentation). I was involved into several commercial projects:

 - Linux-based application for automation of GSM Traffic Node data analysis. 
The C++ application aimed to analyze the behavior and health status of the mobile network, provide communication with node's central processor and to mediate between the node and other tools through the Managed Object Model.

- Software for the O-RU node in accordance to the O-RAN standardized YANG models.  
The C++ application that implements management plane functionality of O-RU(5G) node on embedded hardware.

- Indoor positioning
The precise calculation of the moving body position in 3D space. My contribution to the project is providing the algorithm that calculates relative orientation (Euler angles) of the body, calibrating the raw data from IMU sensor, and validation of the obtained results.

In my role as a developer, I constantly strive to develop and deepen my skills in computer science. My goal is to become even more technical in the peculiarities of operating systems to be able to write fast and correct programs.

I have a background in software development and my skills are constantly improving. While implementing the wrapper over the RoomPlan framework, I worked on the project ""House Plan Generator"", which allows you to get a 2D plan projection of a scan using the framework. To do this, I used the Swift programming language, SwiftUI, and RoomPlan.

I also took part in the project ""Sintering Process Simulator"", where my task was to record and repeat actions using the Dear ImGui Test Engine. I was actively improving the process automation capabilities of the application using the C++14 programming language, as well as Dear ImGui, OpenGL, and Boost libraries.

Within the Geometric Format Translator project, I performed various tasks according to my experience. For example, I improved the testing system for checking the correctness of converted files by adding support for one more format. I also restructured the code, removed outdated components, and replaced them with newer ones. In this project, I used C++14, CMake, Linux, and Python programming languages.

I also developed a mesh editor application from scratch. This editor is capable of reading, writing, and rendering files in COLLADA format, as well as performing various manipulations with objects. For this project, I used the C++17 programming language, as well as the OpenGL and GLFW libraries.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in various projects and tasks, employing a broad range of technologies such as Qt/QML, C, C++, Embedded Linux, Linux Device Drivers and Yocto. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of multithreading and networking principles, particularly TCP/IP. 

In one of my roles, I worked on software development for a class C (high-risk) medical device. Here, my responsibilities involved designing and developing a network client-server tool that created virtual controllable SMBus, CAN, GPIO, Serial, and IIO devices. I achieved this by applying such technologies as Qt, QML, C, C++ (including modern standards like C++ 14, 17, 20), multithreading, networking, and Embedded Linux. I adhered to best practices while implementing modern features, ensuring the tool met all stakeholder requirements. 

In addition to creating the tool, I was also responsible for maintaining comprehensive documentation and continually adapting the tool to keep up with evolving technologies. Additionally, I actively identified and implemented new features to enhance the tool's usability and versatility.

In another role, I took part in the development of an intelligent medical beauty - device where my responsibilities included bug fixing, code refactoring, and implementing new functionality. I enhanced software quality and readability through code refactoring, resulting in better long-term maintainability. The main technologies I used were C++17, Qt and Yocto.

Currently, in my team, I am recognized as a reliable developer with robust problem-solving skills and an ability to quickly adapt to new technologies. My goal is to continue to grow in the field of software development, particularly in creating and enhancing high-quality and reliable software.

During the internship I was developing Zombieland game. That`s a third-person story shooter with different types of weapons and enemies, that also includes different mechanics of them.

Key Tasks:
Create main character
Create HUD and all necessary menus (main, pause, settings menus, death screen, etc.) with localization
Create melee, ranged and AOE weapons
Create 4 different enemy classes including boss
Create enemy and pickup spawners
Implement animations, VFX and sound effects
Implement level streaming and cutscenes
Create Save/ Load system for player and level


As well I have several pet-projects in my Gitlab:

3D sphere move - this project was a test task for a job at ModuleWorks. Here we have a sphere that moves thru a 3d surface on a specific path and delete from it each point it touches. My task was to find this dots and save the 1st layer of the surface.

Pif paf game - was developed as university project to learn OOP basics and how to work with SFML library. It`s a 2d game, where you watch from the top, move your character, rotate and shoot into enemies, that are running after you.

Long Int - as well created as a university project to study OOP and algorithms for a work with very long numbers. Algorithms were taken from the Knuth`s book. (such as quick multiplication, addition etc.)

Now I'm deeply immersed in the learning C++:
  - implementation of audio tag editing application (using Taglib)
  - implementation of text editor like notepad++
  - implementation of classical games: snake and chess game (sfml framework)  ONLY multiplayer without AI;
  - implementation of video editor (using mlt/mlt++ framework)
  - implementation of task manager (project tracker like Trello or Notion).

Dependencies (Frameworks) I have worked with:
  - back-end or core (Qt5,  Glib);
  - front-end or graphics (Qt5 and Qml, Qtk, Sfml, SDL, openGL a little bit);
  - audio and video (SDL, mlt/mlt++, openGL);
  - databases (sqlite3, mongoDB a little bit);
  - others (cUrl, oAuth, smtp, Taglib, git).
 
Also I have had a little bit experience with python, js (pure, react, react-native).

I am a civil engineer who has 6-year experience in the field as Technical Engineer. During the aforementioned period I have worked in diverse environments around the world at challenging industrial projects. I am, also, candidate of MSc. Software Engineering at Kiev Polytechnic Institute.

As a technical engineer, my main duty was not only to come up with civil engineering solutions for the projects I have worked, but also writing some scripts to streamline daily routine works, such as frequent test results' analysis, repetitive budget updates, preparation of the reports or creating basic applications.

In addition to writing scripts, since I enjoy coding, I started learning basics of software engineering and logic behind programming by profiting self-guided learning tools. So I have been studying on C/C++, Python-3, common algorithms, data structures, most common problems and solutions techniques etc. for couple of years. Eventually I have decided to have proper education and study on software engineering at university.

For this purpose, I have taken necessary actions and started studying at KPI for MSc. Software Engineering. In these days, not only I stay focused on my courses and even challenge myself to learn more by studying additional online content, but also looking for a position in the industry without any beneficiary expectations. I strongly believe that by studying and working simultaneously, I will improve myself not only academically, but also in terms of real programming world implementations.

I also firmly believe that my enthusiasm and motivation regarding software engineering will add value to the any position I work and ultimately the organization where mentioned position is held.

Thank you for your time to read my summary.
Have a nice day.

Programming languages
• Strong С++. Basic knowledge of STL. I Have working experience with BOOST, QT, WinApi and other libraries. I am using CMake for building projects in Clion and CLI
• Java SE/EE — basic knowledge. Familiar with build tools such as Gradle and Maven.
• SQL— basic knowledge.
• C#, PHP, HTML+CSS+JS , Python, NASM and VHDL — university subjects. 

I am interested in developing back-end or IoT systems. As an example my last project: smart-home

This project provides a custom implementation of the ""smart-home"" IoT system. Solution consist of several parts:
• SDK that contains basic components such as messages Producers/Consumers
• Hubs that collect information from the devices and send it to the “Kafka”
• Modules that read messages from “Kafka”, handle them and store information of devices’ activity, devices properties changes and other additional data
• Web-application that built as a Spring Application with MVC architecture and supports REST API
The project was developed by a team where I was the main developer and had to organize and control the development process. Gained skills: UML-diagrams drawing and code generation based on classes diagrams, custom docker images creation, manual deploy, SDK creation that consist of different modules and plain DTO objects as well as Spring components, integration testing. As a result I gained team-work experience being lead developer.

Worked as a Junior C++ developer for a little over a year, but during that time I learned how to prioritize tasks, read other people's code, think from the user's pov, make improvements to a working product.

Technologies stack used on the previous work: core of the application C++ (Qt), front-end QML+JavaScript, back-end T-SQL
"
c++,"Wrote real-time code for embedded as well as enterprise fin data processors.
Worked with C++11 as well as old C++03.
Started my career _ Game Insight, worked on:
- Big Business Deluxe (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.bbdeluxe) - Junior Developer, maintenance, bug fixing
- Mystery Manor (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameinsight.gplay.mmanor) - Middle Developer, porting pure Objective-C game to crossplatform C++ in-house engine

Moved to Prague (Czech Republic) to work on enterprise banking projects in a multinational corporation.

Worked with C++ for 4 years, have expertise in:
- C++11 (move semantics, smart memory, lambdas, threads), C++03, STL, Boost, algorithm development, assessment, architecture development, optimization.

Have experience presenting and explaining my own solutions to the public.
Can build coding pipeline from the ground up.
I'm specializing on business logic, algorithms, structures, architecture, not math programming: I'm comfortable with basic linear algebra, probability theory, Boolean algebra, graphs and geometry, but barely anything beyond this level. On the other hand I have no problem learning advanced maths if objectively really needed. None needed so far ¯\_()_/¯
Not interested in working in Ukraine or CIS.

Technical:

* Version control system: just have one

* Build system: either you use mainstream one like Make/CMake/Autotools/etc or have a responsible supporting maintainer for custom one. Working with a build system with as much as few e-mails left from its' original development in early 00's is a big nope.

* Task tracker: Redmine/Jira/Bugzilla/etc, doesn't matter as soon as you have one. Shared Excel/GSheet is definitely not one.

* Both styleguide AND naming conventions: I don't care whether you force Java or Allman style indents, tabs or spaces, CamelCase or snake_case, as soon as you have coding standards: documented and/or set up technically (by the means of clang-format, astyle or any other tool). By ""have"" I mean ""force"".

* Debugging: the project must have fully-functional debuggable build. By debuggable I mean there should be working breakpoints, stack and variable views. GUI is not mandatory, CLI like gdb is fine.
Debugging using asserts and logs only is not considered one.

* Code analysis: cross-review, static analyzers (cppcheck/PVS-Studio/etc), lizard, ASan, etc. The more code is analyzed - the better (at least from time to time).

* CI: optional if PM's don't trigger devs to build the project every other day.

It's okay if you miss something mandatory from the above list but want to introduce - I'd be glad to assist the process.

Other:

* Contractor-friendly or visa support: I'm a non-EU resident, but backed by an umbrella agency in Czech.

* Relocation bonus

* Access to web radio and audio streaming services (Spotify, Google Music)

* Open source project: optional, HUGE plus"

1. Remote Console
The client-server application allows access to a remote terminal without using the Telnet protocol. Target platform - Windows. API for the console from Microsoft. The server is synchronous, based on the specifics of the task: the user writes a command to the console, which is executed on the server. Using the Console API, the output buffer is read and sent back to the client. The server console is running as a separate process.

Over 5 years of commercial experience and counting.
So far have worked on three different projects in three different companies:
  * a cross-platform gamedev project for a product company where I started as an intern; during different periods of time did gameplay programming (mostly integration of the a minigame into the main game) and UI programming (porting of game UI elements onto a new UI engine).
  * a high loaded Linux-based digital video processing system for an outsourcing company; the project was mature and complex and not very well maintained over its lifespan so most of the time was spent on maintenance tasks like bug-fixing, refactoring, helping customer support with difficult customer issues (it was a B2B product); but we also kept extending the functionality by adding new features which usually wasn't a trivial task to do because of the complexity of the project, its age and the fact that its components were very tightly coupled; at the later stages I also helped with hiring new people (applicant selection and carrying out the technical interviews) and mentoring them.
  * my current project is a desktop (Win and Mac) digital photo editing software; I work in the image processing development team for one of the company's products where we integrate the code bought from a third-party company into an image processing framework used in other products of the company, occasionally we also touch the UI code of the application, but normally that's the responsibility of the dedicated team :)
What is common for all my projects is that they featured (or feature) extensive collaboration and direct communication with the colleagues all around the world. They all had/have large and complex code bases, not always well-maintained, but always interesting to learn and explore.
What would definitely be a plus for me is a reasonably new project (the lower limit is C++14), where I could fully make use of modern language facilities and well proven best practices.
Ideally the amount of code maintenance on the project should be 40% at most, preferably less.
Also I'd like a team with well established processes.
If you can offer some relocation opportunities in the future, that is also a huge plus.
Not particularly interested in low level and embedded projects.
Finally please pay attention to the ""I don't work with section""."

- Requirements analysis
- Analysis of CR-s
- Review of the navigation module's performance
- Communications with major Navigation stack-holders regarding design and architecture
- Support of analysis of the complex stability and performance issues
- Keeping knowledge regarding the ""overall picture"" of the Navigation module
- Knowledge transfer to colleagues and teams
- Support with project's adaptations
- Support with code-reviews
- Development and population of basic C++ concepts, which are then being re-used within the project

On top of that, I can add:

c++,"* I designed and implemented a new service from the ground-up for both macOS (Intel/ARM) and Windows platforms. Which involved communicating directly with the Product Owner and other stakeholders to define a project structure, establish processes and break down requirements into stories and tasks. Managing other engineers, delegating tasks and communication in general.
* Being quite versatile in terms of technologies, languages, platforms and tools (see my CV). It all depends on project's needs.
* In my spare time I made an open-source app for MacOS that allows you to change input source using Windows-style shortcuts (which is otherwise not possible on macOS) and it got recommended by someone on Apple's own forum page =)
* I also made a couple of small computer and smartphone games usign Unity game engine.
* I made a personality-matching mobile app where people with similar values can get in touch (which required me to learn how to setup AWS server and database, establish communication with mobile app as well as making a mobile app in the first place (since previously I was only working with desktop applications)) but after Beta-testing I decided to shut it down as it would requite a lot of time and resources to continue.
My most recent experience:
Working with a multinational manufacturer of computer peripherals and software solutions to configure them.

My responsibilities:
* Designing and implementing a new plugin-service from the ground-up and establishing inter-process communication between services on both macOS (Intel/ARM) and Windows platforms
* Integrating 3rd party frameworks and SDK
* Communicating directly with the Product Owner and other stakeholders to define a project structure, establish processes and break down requirements into stories and tasks
* Creating UML diagrams and presentations in order to get feedback from the main architects 
* Proposing risk-mitigation solutions and resolving non-trivial problems
* At the later stage of the project besides development also managing 3 other engineers, delegating tasks, facilitating their communication with PO and QA, providing suggestions and reviewing their code
* Creating POCs and implementing Qt-based UI solutions.
* At the initial stage of the project I was also responsible for writing Python scripts that would compile/package/sign(notarize) and deploy our app, defining branching strategy and handling system-level permissions but at the later stage we hired a devOps who took over these responsibilities.
* Since I was the first engineer working on the project I was also responsible for onboarding FrontEnd and devOps engineers who joined later.

My previous experience:
I have also been working as a member of outstuff UX and development team at a pioneer Belgium-based company that delivers supply chain solutions for more than 35 years now. 

My responsibilities:
* Engaged in restructuring the existing code base in order to improve performance, usability and move away from a monolithic architecture to a more 'client-server' based one
* Implementing Qt-based UI solutions, upgrading Qt to a newer version
* Working on POCs (proof of concept) to improve our debugging processes
* Debugging

Another project I had a chance to work on was a secure Chromium-based web-browser designed for financial institutions and corporations that enables you to securely access your company resources without having to use VPN and also keeps all your documents safe. Here my responsibilities were mainly debugging.
I'm looking forward to join a friendly team to work together on an interesting project where I can provide value and at the same time improve my knowledge and skills.

5 years of commercial software engineering experience.
Over 10 years writing high-performance code on competitions, in research and commercial projects in total.
Through all these years I've been restlessly taking charge and responsibility for complicated tasks, projects and ideas. Most of them I was succesfully able to materialize, saving time and resources for teams and companies I've been working with.
I was producing high-qualify, well-shaped code, always aiming for simplicity. For that, from the very beginning I was paying a lot of attention to understanding requirements and getting as accurate specifications, as possible. In my experience, lack of those is the first source of huge resoures waste, so that is why I'm always trying to see bigger picture. Strong knowledge of computer science basics such as algorithms and data structures, OOP, different programing languages and it's concepts, which I've gained during my early programming years, was a great help.
I was always putting reasonable effort into setting up processes and CI in my teams, as it usually save sensible amount of time and make things more reliable. Through that I've achieved good understanding of software development life cycle, which later brought me to coordinating role for teams in multiple remote locations. I have experience working with Jira and other tools in Agile/Scrum environments with all it's benefits and limitations.
But driving people to achieve new goals was always what I enjoyed the most. Before pandemic, technical meetups were always a place where it's easy to find me. Now, working full-remote, I'm running not less that 2 meetups per month on different development topics - following procedures and having modern workflow is point to improve on my current project.
My last 2 years were in financial (market data) domain. Before that, I had experience with data processing tools, firmware and automotive.
I believe that software development is about making the product, not a software :) Working with people who share this concept is a plus.
I'm not afraid of working with legacy code, and I know how to deal with it. But having modern stack, running new development or at least approval for refactoring what is most rusty and buggy is essintially a plus.

I have extensive experience as a Senior Software Engineer, specializing in C/C++ and Linux. Throughout my career, I have gained a solid foundation in software development and honed my expertise in these specific technologies.

My software development experience spans the entire software development life cycle, from requirement analysis to design, implementation, testing, and deployment. I am highly skilled in writing efficient and reliable code using C/C++, primarily for Unix-like systems.

In addition to software development, I have also worked on developing and maintaining core components of software applications. This includes optimizing code for performance and debugging complex issues.

My expertise in Linux development includes experience working with Linux-based systems and development environments. This includes writing code that interacts with the Linux kernel, working with system-level APIs and libraries, and understanding Linux-specific concepts such as processes, threads, and interprocess communication.

As a result, I possess a deep understanding of system software development and writing device drivers, network protocols, and embedded systems software. This skill set involves low-level programming (ARM and x86 assembly programming), interacting with hardware components, and ensuring proper integration with the underlying operating system.

c++,"My interest in computer sciences has began in 1990. A year later, I started writing in C language. In two years when I was 14, I already had my first part-time job as a developer of an inprocess testing system for production of washing machines.

By today and over the course of about 30 years of professional experience, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge about a large spectrum of technologies, ranging from microcontrollers to mainframes, from web sites and VoIP solutions to automotive productions and object recognition. I have used a wide range of programming languages and worked in different roles in IT business (from technical support in Internet service provider to project manager in outsourcing companies). This accumulated experience gives me an all-round understanding of software development process solutions, customer’s needs, responsibilities of any person involved and an overall good insight into the business.

Although I have a robust understanding of various technologies, over the past 20 years I have been focusing deliberately on C and C++ languages for UNIX-like systems, what gave me a profound knowledge of these particular approaches, so I have got quite an expertise in this area.  

At present, I prefer Lead Developer or System Architect duties.

3. Developed some algorithms, such as:
    - the program places the tetris shapes that are read from a text file in the smallest possible square.
    - the program analyzes a virtual field of a given size, and, in a given order with the enemy, puts
random shapes generated by a virtual machine.
    - the program is based on working with graphs. The task was to redirect the conditional ""ants"" one by one from the starting point to the final one in a minimum number of moves and minimum time when using a rational number of paths.
The first training phase lured me into the field of programming, and now I have a great desire to immerse myself in the second stage - commercial projects.
