Hi, I started with my projects, the first was a service for advertising management and activities for the social network of Telegrams. It was a desktop app, I was involved in all the activities of the project (because there were only two people here) from idea to sale. So I managed to get a very great experience. Used .Net for the application, php for the licensing system there management. In general, I consider this project my first step into an interesting world.

Then for a long time engaged in freelance and own pet projects. At this time I was more focused on java, back-end in particular spring framework. I also had to try myself in the role of front-end dev, used react. This period I think gave me more understanding of people (I mean the transition from words to planning, implementation). I think at this stage of life I went to a new level of googling) From the practical gained new skills it was java. There were, of course, interesting long-term projects. one also managed to go from idea formation to realization.

After that, I had experience working with a company that deals with traffic advertising. here I had experience working and integrating with ""cloaca"" systems like keitaro. I also developed similar systems myself. I was developing and integrating android applications. most often it was work with facebook/google/etc sdk, payment system. Most of my work was devoted to automation, in particular for Facebook publications. I used java, php, phyton, c #, libgdx, unity, Spring.

I have experience working in a startup with a small company. For the most part, I was fully involved in the development from scratch of the crm system, back-end for the online store, integration with our partners, using spring. Also went to the development of the main site, the Internet store, used vue-js. Here I will get a great experience because I was the main programmer, and had a lot of responsibility.

My last job was in a fintech company. was in the r&d team. I transferred all services to log4j2 logging. I also optimized the search for bugs in all services because I added a special ""Id"" which helps to trace the path from where the ""problems"" started. Developed the Cloud Conifg server architecture. spring,spring cloud

I want an interesting project, preferably back-end development, but if there is something different, but interesting, I'm all hands for. I want problems and the opportunity to solve them.

I've been solving problems with computers for the last ten years. 

My experience includes working across the stack, from business requirements to a 
final product. The other part is working as a developer as part of a team 
inside a large company. So I have experience across the whole stack. 

I wrote scripts, made apps, and wrote backend/frontend code. Designed and implemented
public-facing APIs used by many clients. Solved performance problems and complex 
bugs in a distributed environment. Developed scrapers and data cleaners. Maintained backward
compatibility. Worked with teams and alone to deliver solutions. Communicated cross-team to solve problems spanning across systems.
I enjoy functional programming and complex domains. 
I would instead work on data transformation using interesting algos
than on implementing an app. I want to design systems. It is of great 
importance for me to be off during the day to be able to maintain concentration 
on a work domain instead of constantly answering questions on slack. 
It would be a great plus if I could work part-time. I would like to 
get into consulting."
full stack,"Capable of both backend and frontend development ""from scratch"" utilizing various languages and technologies. Quick to pick up new exciting technologies to experiment with them.

full stack,"One of the most significant accomplishments that I am incredibly proud of is my journey as a full-stack developer, where I took on the challenge of learning AWS cloud services and successfully optimized my company's expenses by fifty percent through resource utilization optimization. This achievement highlights not only my technical expertise but also my ability to drive tangible cost savings for the organization.
In my professional journey, I have successfully completed several projects and tasks across different domains. Some of my notable accomplishments include developing a comprehensive hospital management system, implementing an HR system with IoT integration, and actively participating in business-to-customer and enterprise resource planning (ERP) development projects.

To enhance my skills and knowledge, I have acquired certifications in full stack development from Microverse, Azure cloud from Microverse, and AWS. These certifications have equipped me with a strong foundation in various technologies and tools.

Regarding my technical expertise, I have utilized programming languages such as Python, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript for web development purposes. Additionally, I have leveraged tools like Docker, Kubernetes (k8s), Jenkins, Jira, GitLab, and GitHub for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration.

Currently, I hold the position of a DevOps expert and Frontend Developer. In this role, I strive to make the development process within my company more streamlined and automated. By utilizing my knowledge of DevOps practices and frontend development, I contribute to creating efficient workflows and improved user experiences.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue expanding my skill set and integrate new technologies into our product.

Created an e-commerce site named ""BeTheOne."" Developed a robust and user-friendly platform using technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and front-end frameworks like React or Angular. Implemented features like product catalogs, shopping carts, secure payment gateways, and order management, providing a seamless online shopping experience for customers.
Served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of ElmX, an edtech company. Led the technology team, overseeing software development projects, setting technical direction, and managing resources. Implemented efficient development processes, fostered innovation, and played a key role in the successful delivery of software products.
During my software internship at a bank in Azerbaijan, I gained valuable experience working with a team of developers on various projects. I actively contributed to the development and deployment of software applications that enhanced the bank's internal processes, such as customer management and transaction tracking.

After my internship, I joined an edtech company called ElmX, where I continued to expand my skills. As part of the development team, I was responsible for building and deploying web applications using Node.js and Nest.js frameworks. I gained expertise in deploying applications on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing technologies like Kubernetes and App Engine to ensure scalability and reliability.

In addition to my experience with Node.js and Nest.js, I also have proficiency in developing MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack applications. I have worked on projects where I leveraged these stacks to build robust and dynamic web applications.

Moreover, I have experience working with databases, such as MongoDB for NoSQL databases and ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) for SQL databases, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. I am comfortable utilizing serverless functions, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, to build scalable and event-driven applications. Additionally, I have worked with cloud messaging services to implement real-time communication and notification features.

Furthermore, I have utilized Firebase, a comprehensive development platform, to build applications for startups. Firebase provides a wide range of services, including authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting, allowing for rapid prototyping and development of scalable applications.

In my role at ElmX, I collaborated closely with frontend developers, UX designers, and product managers to deliver user-friendly and efficient software solutions. I actively participated in code reviews, testing, and troubleshooting to ensure the quality and stability of the applications.

Moving forward, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in full-stack development. I am particularly interested in exploring new frontend frameworks and libraries to further enhance the user experience. Additionally, I aim to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in software development to continuously improve the efficiency and quality of my work.
While I have gained experience and proficiency in various technologies and tasks, there are certain areas that I prefer not to focus on. For example, I would prefer not to be heavily involved in database administration tasks, such as database configuration, optimization, and performance tuning. While I am comfortable working with databases and utilizing ORMs, my primary interest lies in application development and solving business logic challenges.

Additionally, I would prefer not to engage in extensive front-end design work or graphic design tasks. While I have collaborated with UX designers and front-end developers in the past, my expertise lies more in back-end development and implementing complex business logic.

By clarifying these preferences, it helps to align expectations and ensures that I can contribute most effectively in areas that align with my skills and interests."

full stack,"
Extended expertise in building SPA applications using modern tech stacks.
I like to build. I build teams, products, processes, and all of them at the same time. 
For more than 8 years of my software engineering, I have been using a lot of different frameworks and technologies which allowed me to look at things from a different perspective. 

Starting way back then from Can, Backbone, moving forward with Angular 1.4, SASS, using Grant, and then Gulp to build apps for Nissan car head units, a tool for sports club management, and CRM for accounting.
Touching React and Redux for the first time when React was at 0.14 and building that with webpack. 

Made a step aside for a year and a half with a new project using EmberJS, a fintech company specializing in B2B currency exchange online.
 
And then worked as a Fullstack for a year using MeteorJS and MongoDB, building a social network and medical DB for people with cancer.

After that tried a bit of mobile development using React Native for half a year, building an app for online shopping. Pure functioning programming, Ramda, ReduxSaga - good time, well spent.

Next, I decided to start my lead career. And build the whole frontend department of the company from 2 to 15 people, along with code review, ci, infrastructure, mentoring, and interview processes. Cypersport domain, lots of different projects around it.
Had some time to play with LernaJS, packaging, and monorepo; SocketJS, ExpressJS and microservice architecture; pipelines and ci; AWS S3, Cloudfront, Route 53, and AWS Edge Lambda, NextJS; 
Have experience closely working with SEO optimization, AB testing, and Google Analytics.

Worked for 1.5 years at a top-notch cybersecurity startup with people from Google, Slack, Dropbox, and Amazon. Get to know advanced TS patterns, Apollo/GraphQL client, and a bit of Django/Python. Contributed to building components based on MUI. 

My next domain was game development, where I was frontend lead, responsible for development mostly admin panel for creators of our social fiction platform. Typical startup mess, pure javascript, an old CRA app, an old Cordova app with global variables without even a bundler. 
Here I didn't quite learn, but rather applied all my skills from before. I set up the code review process, and frontend infrastructure on AWS, CI using CirlceCI, formatted all code with eslint and added it to CI and pre-commit, gradually introduced TS, created a component library, and integrated SentryJS.
First things first - domain. I am interested in mental health, consciousness, optimization of human life or processes, products for digital nomads or traveling, the human brain or health research, datings, and IoT. 

Searching for a lead, full-stack, or architect role. I would like to learn more about the backend and architecture while sharing and using my expertise in the frontend.

My direct manager is a guru of backend and architecture, has great soft skills, and is open to new ideas.

The leadership team (C-level) is open-minded, encourages initiative, easily reachable, and ideally shares how and where we earn and spend money. 

Colleges are highly motivated and always willing to learn new things, at least some of them have high expertise in their field. 

Hope to jump into a microservices architecture, ideally in TS(JS), maybe NestJS. Frotendwise - doesn't matter so much - I can adapt to good new things and improve bad old things, having time and permission to do so.

For me, it is important that processes of development are either good or we know that we wanna improve them. ""It works somehow, don't touch"" in the process is a red flag for me - I am not the right person for that. 

Speaking of proportion between coding and management - 50-50 is good. I am interested in both. I would like to bootstrap, prototype new things and hand them over.

I live in Bali now and working from an office is not a good option for me. I have been working remotely from home for quite a while before Covid, I like my job and I like when I am trusted. I can get up at night if needed to participate in calls. But conceptually I think offices are gone now. Also, I saw too many people slacking in offices to consider those of any efficient benefit. 

I can and sometimes like working under pressure, but the reason for it should be fair and the amount should be understandable. If the fire state is a normal state of things - I can help fix it, I can think about it, propose new solutions, and work overtime to improve this. What I can't do is pretend this is ok.

I know this is quite a lot, but I am worth it and I am ready to be where I belong."

I am a web developer with more than 8 years of experience. At the beginning of my journey, I used to work with plenty of php  frameworks and cms as fullstack dev, javascript was my second language. But some time later, I decided to switch completely to JS. Today I have more than 5 years experience with React, Vue, Node Js, GraphQl and many other technologies and tools.
  I worked both alone on projects, and with teams. I worked with big teams, small teams, and international teams. Have experience in team leading and mentoring.
  As frontend and fulstack developer, I've taken part in development of many different projects, such as crypto crowding platform, designers and photographers social network, security face-recognized system and many others.

Sometimes I generate ideas. Sometimes I push for seeing the results of the work of our team. Sometimes I strive for improving working conditions, like ensuring wlan coverage or introducing waste recycling. Motivation should not be underestimated.
Oh, and I've figured out how to construct a simple CI/CD pipeline from Github to a commercial hosting. In a day, by sifting through docs. Not that I do that kind of thing all the time...
I'm a Junior FrontEnd.
Since my little 1-month experiment shows that HR people currently entirely ignore a Frontend WebDev profile with the word ""Junior"" in the label, I'm removing it. Yeah, it's a trick. Consider this an honest disclaimer.
Also to be entirely transparent: everything in my info is up to questioning/discussion. That's probably obvious but decided to point it explicitly, just in case.

FrontEnd (mainly worked with Git + SASS + HTML5, responsive design, some experience with Jekyll and Bootstrap), currently studying JS frameworks to upgrade to FullStack (estimated completion in about 5 months).
Some of the projects are available on my GH.
Extensive background experience in tech support, tech writing, wiki, C++, Lua, JSON, manual testing and general feedback. Limited experience in programming (C++, C#, Java, SQL). Varying experience in many fields, from game mods to using graphics software and editing videos.

Additional perks:
- Rudimentary graphic manipulation skills (vectorized images / icons for sites)
- Extreme attention to details

Soft skills:
- Google before asking
- Understanding SCRUM workflow
- Extensive feedback
Overall closer to Middle than Jun in soft skills. I lack experience in actual systematic tech teamwork, not the skills to do it. That's precisely what I'm trying to fix here.

Fully Covid-19 vaccinated (Moderna) for co-workers' safety.
- Deepening my experience at FrontEnd
- Starting with BackEnd (don't expect too much too soon since I'm still learning)
- Writing documentation, localization. I like explaining things.

NO:
- Repetitive work. I want to distance myself from Tech Support hotlines.
- Authoritative collective. I value experience and personal qualities, not titles or positions. If you expect the latter to work, you'll be disappointed. Horizontal structure is a plus.
- Russian clientele. Up to discussion, but generally a minus.
- Дія.Сіті. Якщо ваша компанія працює або планує працювати в цьому проекті - нам не по дорозі."

Hello! I am a Front-end / Full-Stack developer with a strong knowledge of JavaScript, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS & SCSS, well-familiar with Node.js

As I am constantly open to new experiences in web development also don't mind learning Vue / Angular / React Native if needed for the project.

The basics of programming I learned during studying at university, where I gained a master's degree as an Engineer-researcher in computer systems and automation.

In web development, I have been for more than a year.
Started exploring Frontend on my own, and then for the last 4 months, I had a full-time practical coding experience (Monday through Friday, more than 10 hours per day), with code reviews from experienced developers and tasks similar to real ones,
which included solving algorithmic tasks (more than 150)
and creating web pages and apps using JavaScript, React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS & SCSS, Node.js, and Express.js (more than 250 closed tasks).

Having worked for 5 years in a web studio in various positions (for instance, Web Administrator, Manual QA), I understand the development cycle from the inside.

Will be happy to work in a team where I can constantly develop and contribute to the development of projects in which I am involved.

On one of the projects, I participated in the creation of a web application for managing medical clinics. My role in the team was to work closely with the back-end developers. We used Node.js and Express technologies to create the back-end part of the application, and for the front-end we chose React and Redux Toolkit to manage the application state. Also, I worked with the Postgree database to store task and user data.
In another volunteering project, I was developing an API and a web application for interacting with payment systems and processing payments. My role was to secure the API. We used PHP with the Laravel framework to create the back-end part, and chose React for the front-end.
At the beginning of my journey, I was only a Front End developer, now my role in the team is a full stack developer who deals with both front-end and back-end.

② Own products are always preferable, but last two years I worked with an outsourcing company and I liked it as well because of diversity of projects;

In the last project, I made a full-fledged film library system using modern development technologies (React, Typescript, Redux Toolkit, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Docker). The project is well typed and has a structured business logic. The backend was implemented using the MVC pattern, where all logic was moved to the service level. I have divided the logical parts of the system into resume_classifier, one of which has a reference to the other. There was also added a functionality with query parameters that were added to the address line when certain actions were performed.
I am excited to be a part of a friendly team and work on interesting projects."

Microservices Development: I have experience writing microservices in Python and Node.js, offering flexibility for projects requiring smaller-scale solutions.

I possess in-depth knowledge of SEO-focused engine design and on-site optimization aligned with Google's best practices. My commitment to A/B testing and UX enhancement is relentless, aiming to offer users a seamless experience.

My team skills are equally strong; I'm adept at communicating with teams in English, efficiently distributing tasks, and accurately estimating timelines for task completion.

Methodology-wise, I have a strong preference for working within Scrum frameworks and use GitLab for project management. I'm experienced with RESTful API and GraphQL for system integrations and familiar with DevOps practices for quick project rollouts.

Project managers can count on me to not only meet but often exceed deadlines. I have the capability to drive a product forward independently, set goals, confront challenges, and find solutions. I'm skilled at identifying both the strengths and weaknesses of team members and assist them in resolving tasks.

I am a results-driven, goal-oriented individual, committed to contributing my best to any team I join.

In terms of personal growth, I am passionate about self-improvement and focus only on activities that energize me. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, having run over 3,300 km in the past three years, and am an avid reader with over 100+ books on business, management, psychology, and marketing under my belt.
Open to new projects or roles in various domains, with a particular interest in innovative and compelling products or startups that can capture my attention and make work a rewarding experience."

"
full stack,"Most significant achievements over the past three years (top of the common small wins):
- Refactoring complex production systems with many integrations to increase stability, speed and further easy extensibility
- Launch country-local projects to the international level
- Significant reduction in the monthly bill for infrastructure and integrated services
- Architecture and development of a multilingual system for working with content, communication with the user and system management
More than twenty years of developing applications and services of varying complexity have allowed me to face various tasks. These included simple REST applications, complex CRM systems, complicated integration or optimization tasks, data control systems, high-load systems with a low failure rate, and other exciting tasks. I also had experience leading development teams, creating a service architecture from scratch, planning and restructuring resources (including abandoned ones).

At the moment, I understand that I have reached the ceiling in development as a lead programmer or even a systems architect.

For further and continuous growth, I would like to participate in a project working with big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Exciting will closely intersect with engineering tasks (practical application in production, everyday life). In addition to a strong python background, received during all this time, and decent engineering education, I have tightened up the theory of AI and ML over the past half a year. So the practical application of knowledge is the primary aspiration in the development of a specialist.

As a Fullstack developer, I have completed a variety of projects and tasks throughout my career. One notable project I worked on was a virtual closet app using React and Redux. I was responsible for designing and implementing the UI, as well as integrating the app with a backend API.

In my current role, I worked as a fullstack developer with TAC Africa, an NGO focused on using technology to detect and prevent crime in Africa. As a member of the development team, I was responsible for designing and implementing user interfaces for their web application. This involved working closely with UX designers and backend developers to create a responsive, user-friendly experience using technologies such as React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also contributed to improving the performance and accessibility of the application, as well as implementing new features based on user feedback. 
I have also worked on projects involving other technologies such as  React and jQuery. In addition to frontend development, I have experience with build tools such as Webpack and Grunt, and version control systems such as Git.
As a member of the team, I take on various roles, including contributing to design discussions, writing and reviewing code, and helping to troubleshoot issues. I strive to continuously improve my skills, whether it be through staying up to date with the latest frontend development trends or seeking feedback from my colleagues.

In PillSorted, I covered our entire platform (OS) with e2e and unit tests. After that, I started refactoring. I refactored part of the FE application, implemented new React features, and moved from context to Redux + Redux observable (rx-js).

I also assisted in launching the CI, which includes tests.

I refactored the BE part written in C#, improving performance in some places by 10x to 100x.

Following that, I worked on the development of the ""warehouse"" and ""dispensary"" sections of the application. Along with a few talented managers in the dispensary, we reduced the cost of preparing goods by nearly half.

I introduced GeoSpatial features (MySql geo spatial) for packaging goods destined for specific areas, reducing packaging costs and reducing delivery time.

Finally, I assisted in launching an application integrated with an online pharmacy shop, which aids in managing customer deliveries and prescriptions.
In 2021 I was working in few outsource companies - Onix (outsource model) and GetApp (outstaff model). I have used such technologies as React and Node.js and everything that close to such stack (e.g. Next.js, Mongoose, Redux, Typescript). There are was only 1 interesting project, and it was about application for creating publications and sending this publications directly to publisher - I'm developed only frontend part on Next.js and Apollo (graphql). After that I joined to the product company (Axora, England) where I'm touched with new technologies such as Gatsby, Contentfull cms and Effector. In that company I've grown as full-cycle developer, I've developed new features starting from discussing them with leadership team in England and finishing with product-ready features. The team structure was flat so everyone did everything. Since February 2022 me and whole engineering team (5 developers + 2 QA + CTO) have switched to PillSorted. It is a startup in HealthCare industry with huge prospects and with the team we have dove into new domain and technologies (C#, MySql and a lot of integrations with NHS). Because engineering team was the same nothing in our processes was changed, same role and processes. In one and almost the half year of experience in PillSorted I've learned a lot of new - C# (EF core), MySql, NHS domain. Apart from that I've improved my ownership skills.

Apart from ""contract experience"" I also have ""side hustle"" experience, me and one more developer developed assist.video platform where a talented employees in cinema industry can find a contractors and vice versa - contractors can find a employees.

I have worked with apps' accessibility, which helped project to be more friendly to different people.

Have contributed to creation of form-builder, which helped customers to gain more control over domains creation and as a result to reduce time for frequent feature development and corrections.

full stack,"Among the achievements, I can include the fact that despite my little work experience, I took part and contributed a lot of useful things to the projects that I was involved in and to the team:

After the changes, we started using Radis cache, storing news in it for a certain time and requesting them after they become out of date.

- Me and the team with which we worked (at that time 3 people participated in the project) managed to assemble a fully functional mail service client in 2 months. Given the volume of tasks, we have done a great job in 2 months and made a service that works now and will work for a long time :)

- I am trusted with large projects. Now I'm making a new version of the mail service myself (with a new design and functionality).

- I was a mentor for 2 people. I helped people who just got into the company to understand projects, technologies that we use, tasks, etc. Also, I help my colleagues in solving controversial/difficult tasks.
I am currently working on two projects: a mail service(similar to Gmail) and a backend for crypto casinos. A little more about projects in order:

Front end (and some backend tasks :) ) for mail service. As mentioned above, the project for the most part repeats the functionality of Gmail: options for displaying(preview modes), sorting options, drag and drop, viewing/sending letters, etc., but also, this project has its own features that I cannot disclose. This project is currently being fully implemented by me (including setting up linters, pre-commit hooks, tailwinds, etc.). The project uses: TS, react, redux stack.

Crypto casinos. The project uses Nest.js(graphql), TS, and typeorm. As part of working on this project, I implemented cashback modules, captchas, logic, and validation (using seeds and calculated hashes) of the game, as well as finalizing other modules, such as authentication, token mining, activity logs, etc. Also, a subscription module (with Redis pubsub) was implemented to notify users about funds crediting, rank increase.

Also, I have implemented a portal(js, react, redux stack) for the user from scratch, with news, weather, stocks, reminders, and a calendar(a light version of google calendar, the interface is the same, but it is possible to add only birthdays, reminders, and tasks). In addition, other projects on which I worked or periodically perform tasks now: client for setting up an account with an Internet provider, CRM (for an Internet provider), a backend for a portal, a backend for a user account (the last two use apollo-server-express).

full stack,"I am proud of my accomplishments in the technology field. As a software developer working for the Ethiopian National Security Agency, I have utilized some of the best tech stacks available to create powerful and secure applications. Not only do these applications help protect Ethiopians from threats both domestic and abroad, they also provide an invaluable service to citizens around the world.

The most recent accomplishment that I'm particularly proud of is developing a system that allows users to access their data securely online without having to worry about their information falling into malicious hands or being exposed by hackers. This system utilizes encryption algorithms as well as other security measures such as two-factor authentication and biometric identification techniques which make it nearly impossible for anyone but authorized personnel to access sensitive data stored within our systems. Additionally, this system has been tested extensively against various attack vectors so we can be sure that it will remain secure even if attackers attempt sophisticated attacks on our systems. 

Finally, I am very pleased with how successful my work has been in helping Ethiopia build its digital infrastructure while protecting its citizens from cybercrime at home and abroad; this is something which many countries struggle with due lack of resources or simply because they don't prioritize cybersecurity enough - something which Ethiopia does not suffer from thanks largely due diligence taken by myself along with others who are part of our team here at INSA (Information Network security agency). With all these factors combined together, we are confident that any potential threat posed towards Ethiopian networks can be effectively countered using modern technologies developed right here in Ethiopia!

The ability to know what you do not want to do is a key factor in finding success and personal fulfillment. Being able to identify the things that we don’t want can help us narrow down our options, prioritize our goals, and focus on the areas of life that are most important. Knowing exactly what you don’t want out of life allows us to make decisions confidently, with clarity and purpose.

For example, if someone knows they have no interest in pursuing a career in finance or accounting but does enjoy creative writing or graphic design then it makes sense for them put their energy into those passions instead of wasting time trying something they have no desire for. Having an understanding of which paths will lead nowhere helps people save time by avoiding unnecessary detours while also helping them stay motivated as they pursue something meaningful and worthwhile. 

Ultimately having clear insight into one's own desires can be incredibly empowering when it comes to making decisions about education choices or job opportunities; knowing precisely what we don't wish for gives us more control over our lives so that we can create positive changes without getting bogged down by false starts or wasted effort along the way. By recognizing your limitations early on, you set yourself up for greater success further down the road because you are able to take action toward achieving your dreams rather than being stuck spinning your wheels with indecision."

As a software developer my experience is based on 10+ years of work. 
Long story short I worked with different size teams, different customers, different technologies was used for software development and different programming languages were used in the stacks. 

Now I work fro last year as a software developer in a team with strong Cloud DevOps. I do write code on python, php and infra on typescript(cdk) and cloudfromation fro AWS cloud. 

The year before I had a nice experience working with product from England. Project stack existed from python, php,    PostgreSQL, AngularJs.

For 5 previous years I  changed the company to the product one where I continue my full stack role with developing on PHP. Also to the developer stack was added such languages as  Java (Tomcat + Spring) and GoLang that was fully used to build services and micro-services. Also the technologies stack has grown with using queues on RabbitMQ, CI with Jenkins. Also most of things was ""automated"" make files. Also nice help scripts were written on bash scripts. 
One of great features was that this product was a high load one, and one of the things I'm proud of here that I've managed to create one instance of php 7 that could manage up to 900 qps. Lots of nice database know ledges I got here too, how to use queries, build indexes and etc. Because on high load you don't have much space to miss the target. Add filed under the load was a real nice task too. Btw this is the place where I migrated from the person who still not doing the backup to person who is already doing the backups.

First 2 years I developed on php as a full stack using CSM (WP) and frameworks (CodeIgniter, Fuel PHP, Symphony), using SVN/GIT for version controls , MySQL as a db for the project, Memcache / Redis for caching on the Linux based servers with NGINX/Apache.
After 10+ years in development I got to the point that languages and tech stack is only the steps that can be changed to get to the point. This is why I have experience with different stack and will be glad to use any of what I've used and happy to try something new."

As a software engineer, I have completed a variety of projects and tasks using both LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stacks. Some examples of projects include building and maintaining web applications for small businesses, developing an e-commerce platform, and creating a social media platform.

In my previous roles, I have used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL for the LAMP stack and MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js for the MERN stack. I have experience with both front-end and back-end development and have also worked on integrating various APIs and payment gateways.

Currently, I am a full-stack developer, working on a team of developers to build and maintain web applications. My role involves working on both front-end and back-end development tasks and collaborating with other team members to ensure the smooth functioning of the application.

I am always looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with new technologies. In the future, I would like to improve my understanding of newer JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and Vue.js and also work on improving my skills in cloud computing and containerization using technologies like AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.
One area that I would prefer not to work on is projects that have a tight deadline and lack proper planning and organization. These types of projects often result in poor quality code and can cause unnecessary stress for the development team.

Additionally, I would prefer not to work on projects that involve creating or maintaining applications that are against the moral and ethical principles, it can be something that involves illegal activities, or it can be something that goes against the human rights.

Detail-oriented full-stack software engineer with over 7 years of experience in developing complex web applications and android apps. 

Some highlights of the most significant and long-lasting projects I've worked on:

- I started my career by participating in the development of an online training system for one of the Kenyan government's initiative to employ the youth; written on Laravel from scratch. I refactored some core functionalities by moving part of the logic to the abstraction layer, which made future integrations much easier.
- The next huge project was high-traffic and high-loaded mobile loans android application with over 10,000 monthly users. I built the android application from scratch and it connected to external REST and SOAP APIs for credit scoring and payment processing through banks.
- After that, I designed and built an API using Laravel and an android app in Java for scheduling automated clinical appointments for people living with HIV through the government's ministry of health. The system is being used in 50+ healthcare facilities with 300K+ patients receiving appointment reminders.  
- Built an interactive farmers' marketplace App for value chains in rural Africa with offline capability. It supports buyers, sellers and consumers at the bottom of the pyramid. Users maintain personal financial records and can access their funds through mobile money networks (MTN Money, Airtel Money, M-PESA) 
- Created a fully fledged micro-credit system in Laravel with an android app that automates access to Salary advance loans, LPO loans and invoice discount loans. Through REST APIs, the system connects to custom bank APIs and mobile money APIs to allow users to withdraw money from their wallets to their bank accounts or mobile money wallets. Being the only developer on the project. Server maintenance for all the linux servers was also on me.
- Designed and built and API in Lumen for a service-hailing app that links clients to accredited service providers through an Android and iOS app written in flutter. Infrastructure, networking and server maintenance was also part of my tasks for this project. 

Besides the projects mentioned above, I had lots of smaller ones and each had something interesting in it.

I Enjoy writing code that solves problems in the real world.
What I expect from my future position:
- to be fully remote
- to have opportunities for personal growth
- use of modern technologies"

Product builder.
This was a task for configuring the web parser. The product page contained a product builder that allowed the user to customize product properties. It's meaning there could be multiple products with different article numbers. The page did not receive these products, they were generated by the script. I analyzed how the script
does it and configured the parser to handle the logic of generating products. In the future, I upgrated the parser code to handle other types of builder.

The chain of queries.
It was a task for optimisation online shop parsing. Website had a heavy load, it received many packages with
information about categories and products. Information about each product, it's page, and Category could be obtained directly from the main page, but I needed to find exactly the packages that would help me build a product map. I configured the parser to retrieve the necessary packages and parsed the products from them. This speeded up the parsing of this online shop.

I have 4.5 years of experience working as a Full-Stack developer with a specialization in backend development. Throughout my career, I have successfully completed over 7 projects.

In my most recent project, I contributed as a middle back-end developer to an all-in-one collaborative software. This software unified various small apps such as notes, task boards, whiteboards, and wikis into a single space. My responsibilities included delivering features, fixing bugs, maintaining CI/CD processes, and writing unit and integration tests. One of my key contributions was the implementation of a notification system with three channels: Email, in-app notifications for the sidebar, and instant toast messages triggered by notifications.

Prior to that, I worked on a real estate platform where I served as a middle Node.js developer. My tasks involved implementing backend microservices, retrieving property data from third-party APIs, storing it in the database, and sending it to the frontend. Additionally, I implemented security features, such as integrating a secret manager service to securely store sensitive credentials outside of the project.

In another project, I focused on parsing Twitter posts related to cryptocurrency trends. With over 500 influencers posting about cryptocurrency, I developed a solution to retrieve and store these posts in a database. I utilized Google NLP to process the Text and send the analyzed data to the frontend. As a Node.js developer, I implemented multiple Firebase functions to calculate cryptocurrency prices, utilizing pub/sub patterns for efficient communication between functions. The project relied on Node.js, Firebase, and Firestore, while making use of Google Topics.

Throughout these projects, my preferred working stack consisted of Node.js, PostgreSQL, and various AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

TicketCo - ticket booking platform - events made easy

TicketCo app motto was “events made easy”. So it focused on organizer needs.
I started to develop organizer features, such as event reports and reports for taxing & invoicing, running & tracking marketing campaigns, etc.

From the client side, I developed 1st mobile version of the site.
We also developed mobile application.
I was responsible for API for mobile applications. They needed optimizations as well when a lot of data is sent to mobile. So, we decided to use PostgreSQL capabilities of generating JSON which improved performance a lot.

Local Sports Network - sports video streaming

I started as a solo Full-Stack developer with 1-1 communication with CTO & CEO.
Later, when the team grew became an Engineering Manager leading a team.

I am a Back-End developer with 4 years of experience. I consider myself a multi-technology developer, as I started my career in the era of microservices and had a lot of experience in development and delivering services in Java, Go, and Node.js, of course, with consideration given to choosing appropriate technology due to defined requirements. I was participating in the whole cycle of development, from designing systems to supplying the codebase and testing, and then pushing ready artifacts and images to private artifact storage and the Docker registry successively. By the way, Docker is my best friend. My main concerns during development are creating maintainable and robust systems with perfect performance while preserving all deadlines and business aspects. Also, despite Back-End is my main profile, I also have experience developing Front-End in React and Angular. More widely, I can tell in an interview.

I am an experienced fullstack developer with expertise in JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Node.js, and popular frameworks such as React, Angular, and Next.js. My focus lies in building robust and efficient applications. With a solid understanding of backend development using Nest.js, Express, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL, I ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend components. 

Throughout my career, I have actively contributed to a variety of projects, including e-commerce websites. In these projects, I took ownership of the backend development, leveraging my expertise in Node.js and Express to implement critical functionalities such as product listings, user authentication, and order management. This involved designing robust APIs, integrating with third-party payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal, and optimizing database queries for seamless performance. On the frontend, I utilized React or Angular, employing advanced state management techniques using Redux-toolkit or Redux-saga to ensure a smooth user experience. I implemented features like search functionality, user reviews, and responsive design, all while adhering to best practices in performance optimization and code quality.

Projects  experince
Greetings to everyone who is interested in my profile, I have been in the IT field not so long ago, although I dreamed about it since school years, over time I only realized that nothing is impossible, during my studies, which began in September 2022, it was not a programming language and not even the language of HTML markup or css styles, it was English, which I persistently began to study, later I got acquainted with html and css, during my study of the way in IT , I managed to complete 5 projects, the first project was my WebStudio with html and css and figma, the next second team project that I and a team of 6 people completed in 7 days, it was my first important experience, I was lucky to be the team leader where all the code went through my review, I got to know the merging of branches, conflicts in the code and their solutions, in general, this small project for the hotel complex ""MINIMO"" was written using HTML and CSS based on the layout of figma and several libraries. Then I got acquainted with javascript, where I felt like a real developer and felt an even greater desire for IT, although at the beginning, as soon as I started learning the syntax, it was a little difficult to get used to, after writing test tasks in which there is a dynamic request to the server, I wrote my calculator in classes it was exciting to write i used html css and javascript.
Next, I had another interesting team project using javascript, html and css technologies and the use of rest api, I was again lucky to be the leader of a team that consisted of 9 people, thanks to the correct distribution of tasks, we created a cool project of Cinemania within a deadline of 8 days, it was a cool experience in team, I as a team leader played the most important role and also took a lot of responsibility on myself, all the code went through my review, I had to merge branches to write more complex functionality and help the team, sometimes there were conflicts in the code that I successfully resolved.
Later, I mastered React and wrote a small project of a contact book that interacts with the real backend, in the web program you can register or log in if you already have an account and save contacts, a small program but a rich stack of technologies, the program includes page routing, for work with the state, the redux library was used to save the token in local storage redux persist, and react hooks, emotion styling, and html css.
I am waiting for an offer in a friendly team, where I can gain experience and work to become an expert in my field, conquering new heights in my life, which I definitely would not want to do, rather it would be correct to say that I cannot work in an office at this stage of my life, I am looking for only remote work."

Well-familiar with Upwork so will be glad to help you grow
I'm a full-stack web developer with 3 years of commercial experience.  

I had a chance to work in different teams using different technologies. By this time I was able to get a lot of insights into web development and understand how complex it may be. On my recent project, I've been a key developer leading a small team and also took part in tech leader responsibilities. I've been participating in estimation, tech stack selection, refinement, setting QA CI/CD processes,  mentoring, and so on.

Most recently I've been focusing more and more on architectural tasks, team and project management, estimation, proper QA and CI/CD flows, etc. Besides, I was trying to develop better product vision skills, to understand what product users and my customers may need the most.
I'm not a great fan of gambling and similar domains but won't mind if it's a legal business. 

From my ideal project, I'm awaiting something different from just coding. it may be challenges connected to more complex software development problems, such as optimization, working with project architecture and infrastructure. Or maybe more product-related tasks including a little management, RND, and experiments.

I’m a full-stack web developer with more than 3 years of commercial experience, during this time I’ve worked on a different variety of projects from small e-commerce shops to large corporate companies' products from all over the world (North America, Europe, Australia, Asia). 

During my path, I tasted three types of work as a web developer from freelance to IT software companies as well as product companies, so I’m clearly aware of my responsibilities for any type of cooperation. With such a range of experience, I have a good understanding of the product life cycle and its different stages, but as a developer, I prefer to concentrate on the development itself. I see myself as a good problem solver, organized in my work, and with the possibility to concentrate on important things first. 

Every day I’m enjoying what I do and I’m eager to continue in such a manner. Right now I can describe myself on the stage where I truly care about the quality of my work and my motto now is changed from “I’m happy that it’s working” to “How I can make this work faster and better”.

full stack,"- Wrote an adapter from Dojo Toolkit to React, that enabled gradual migration of the project to React, without rewriting it from scratch, thus saving the startup at least 66K$ (the company was going to hire two extra Dojo Toolkit developers for 3000$/mo each, but after the migration we were able to continue without extra hiring for all 11 months which I've been working there);

- In collaboration with an amazing Ops-guy developed an internal Jira plugin allowed management and QA to deploy an isolated environment for any given ticket with a click of a button in Jira, with no involvement from developers;

- Helped a team at an enterprise-sized company (Mulesoft) to reduce their delivery cycle from a few months to a week and stop working overtime;

- For the last two years my team has been functioning without a manager;

- Along the way taught several developers how to *save* their time using tests automation, and how to leverage it to maintain sanity in codebases;

- Taught programming 2 friends from scratch until they got real paid jobs;

- Inspired few developers (according to the developers themselves) to push their boundaries and learn new languages or frameworks.

- Built a network of like-minded fullstack developers (and I can bring them with myself).

If any of the points below gives you a PTSD attack, I can help you:
- Every new feature breaks two old features;
- Everything was fine until you released to production and the whole world felt apart;
- There is just no room to add more meetings, but nothing can get done;
- You spend great amount of time on sprint estimation but deadlines are still being missed;
- Developers beg you for time for some ""technical work"" but no one is able to explain you what has to be done and how long it will take;
- Two developers developed two features in parallel, and now they can't integrate them;
- It feels like business and development speak on two different languages;
- etc.

Those are some of the real phrases I heard from the clients:
- ""Now we deliver once a week instead of once a quarter""
- ""Wtf, developers are happy to automate their tests?""
- ""QA persons finally have time to breath!"" (that's a direct quote)
- ""We don't have to work on weekends anymore""

If you want someone to completely take the burden of technical decisions off your shoulders, so you can focus on the business part, while the app is just magically delivered to production - here I am!

I started to learn programming when I was 13, and 16 years later (9 of which is commercial experience) I can say I know a few things about how to deliver value to users in a *regular and reliable manner*. 

Along this way I've discovered and mastered several practices you have probably heard about, but never seen working well in a ""real world setup"", like tests automation which allows the team to deliver new features without breaking old ones, continuous delivery which makes deployments a routine, agile practices which give you the mythical flexibility, and so on.

Contact me even if you're interested but still not sure - I'll try to answer any of your questions.
It's critically important for me to have the ability of making decisions on development processes and technologies. Otherwise I will not be able to fully leverage my potential, and you will get just an extra pair of hands, while the main benefit from hiring me is to get an extra head. 

- - -

Acceptable backend technology is some ""regular scripting duo"", e.g. PHP/Laravel, Python/Django or Ruby/RoR. It's unlikely that I'll be able to handle something on Java, Go, Scala, etc. Also Elixir is acceptable if you're planning some highload.

It is also totally fine if you have a legacy project that should be resurrected - as far as it's written on one of the scripting languages described above. It's also fine if it has some custom ""homemade"" framework, but I'll ask to take a look on it first. Whatever it is at the end, under no circumstances I'll propose to ""rewrite it from scratch"", but instead will propose a strategy for gradual migration along with developing new features.

Frontend is default for the current year: it's either React, or Vue, or Angular. Something exotic like Svelte is negotiable too, but then you probably don't need to read this Text - just go ahead and contact me. And again, any legacy project can be resurrected.

If you need mobile, it's either React Native or something even more lightweight, like Turbolinks. I unlikely will be able to handle an app that needs an extensive work with native mobile APIs or which has some extreme design tricks or animations. But I' fine with that if you have time to let me figure it out.

The infrastructure is built on top of GitLab CI, Docker and Dokku. If we're talking about a legacy project, the existing infrastructure will be used on start and then upgraded gradually."

Completion of the front-end bootcamp from the EPAM company in 2021-2022 in HTML5, CSS3 (+pre-processors, css modules, style components, BEM), JS, ReactJS (Redux, SPA). The educational task in the laboratory (bootcamp) was to create a site with mock courses built on React. To implement the project, I used these technologies:
-React-Router v6,
-Husky,
-Eslint/prittier,
-Redux/toolkit.

The site was built using SPA technology. A local server acted as the back-end on which user data and information about courses were stored. Data from it was received and sent via the Fetch API. The creation of new courses and the registration of new users, which were later stored on the server, were implemented. When logging in to the account, saving the account data in localStorage via redux-toolkit was implemented to avoid the need to re-login to the account when the window was closed, if the user did not log out.

Later held front-end part of a project by my self.
And after that was moved to back-end developent that was also single handedly supported by me. Technologies used: Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Postman, Stoplight

What is more, I took part in developing back-end features for  a Tilda commercial Australian website that gives clients an opportunity to buy courses and receive credentials for getting them on external resource.

I was involved in a project dedicated to one the biggest USA real estate companies where I worked as back-end developer. I worked under microservice architecture, implemented distributed tracing, made new endpoints for different business purposes. I experienced working with SQL databases, MongoDB database, changed DB schemas according to the new requirements , cooperated with devops team to integrate new features to the project, improved unit tests coverage. I also communicated with the client side for different clarifications as well as presented demos and presentations.

One of my last projects was dedicated to creating a util that gathers data from different open sources.

Lately I was also involved to support the development of a CRM system for one of the most famous luxury brands. I gathered my knowledge to ensure back-end part with best practices of combining AWS S3, DynamoDb and Step functions with Elastic Search. 

In all projects I used Node.Js accompanied by Nest.js  or Express frameworks with SQL, NoSQL databases, AWS and Google Cloud Platform services.

I have been also involved in working with frontend development on a startup dedicated to create CRM platform for Ukrainian trading companies.

Node.JS, AWS And GCP Cloud Services. My proficiency in these technologies, coupled with a strong understanding of
Agile (Scrum) methodologies, has allowed me to successfully collaborate across diverse teams and de-

functional team interactions, aligning the technical aspects of the project with the overall business
objectives. This cross-disciplinary exposure has empowered me with the ability to view software de-
velopment from various perspectives, ensuring the creation of high-impact solutions. Furthermore, my
experience in multinational teams has significantly enhanced my communication skills. I have been
conducting business correspondence in English and have become adept at seamlessly liaising between
technical and non-technical stakeholders. Moving forward, I continue to seek challenging opportunities
where I can leverage my technical acumen and soft skills to develop robust and user-centric back-end

Hello, I am a Fullstack developer (Node.js, React.js) with 2 years of experience and also 2nd year CS student.

I started my career working as a freelancer. Mostly my projects were small there. I worked with pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript there but also had a little experience with WordPress. I learned a lot about pure Browser API during this period and also got precious experience communicating with clients and managing projects.

Then I got a gap in my work and started learning React.js and its environment. I created some pet projects using React, Redux, MUI, React Hooks, and GraphQL/ Apollo Client. Then I also started learning Node.js.

My next career step was the position in Itjet company as a Fullstack developer.

During one-month learning, I went deeper into the backend job - worked with setting up the project: project structure, error handlers, linters, REST best practices, middlewares, Swagger Docs, Sequelize, db migrations, Google API, auth flow, git rebase, working with Jira.

Then, I started a commercial project in the Social sphere as a Fullstack developer. I worked with setting up projects infrastructure (docker, nginx, Cron, SSL, AWS EC2, AWS RDS, IAM, AWS SES, AWS ECR, CI/CD), backend architecture, auth flow, db architecture, and overall backend logic. From the FE side, I also was setting up an infrastructure (AWS S3, AWS Cloudfront, SSL, Vite.js config, CI/CD) worked with Vite.js build tool, Typescript, emotion styles, Canvas API, worked on custom charts with Chart.js, a bit work with Websockets, RTK, RTK Query, Cashing. I started making code reviews and was taking part in FE architecture decisions. We worked with atomic design architecture here. I also was taking part in communicating with clients, figuring out new features, etc. I went through the whole project and we delivered it to a client after half a year.

After that, I joined another project in the Fitness sphere. It was in the near-release stage and got its first customers but it had a lot of bugs. I started working here as a Fullstack developer too. Mostly I worked with the backend: fixed logic, optimized db queries, divided routes by smaller ones, worked with swagger, pure SQL queries, working on new features, communicating with clients, working with Stripe.js and In-App Purchase subscriptions, Webhooks, subscription purchase flow, etc.

During my job at Itjet, I also worked on some pet projects with microservices, Nest.js, testing libs, Redis db and Kafka.
I expect having a job with young and progressive community, working with modern technology (no legacy) and interesting projects. I would appreciate if I could have a direct influence on a project, could communicate with clients and make my own suggestions and be heard"

I have been working in software development since 2012, initially starting as a PHP web developer. In 2015, I transitioned to mobile development and have been continuing on this path ever since.

To further enhance my skills as a software engineer, I decided to explore backend development and took on a local TAXI system project as a side project. The project was developed using Ruby on Rails framework and involved building a highly-loaded backend to handle a large number of drivers and orders. Through this project, I gained invaluable experience in understanding how the backend of mobile applications work and optimizing them for performance.

As part of my continuous learning, I have taken computer science classes, such as ""Crash Course Computer Science,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also regularly solve leetcode problems, as I find that it improves my ability to write better functions, resulting in more efficient programs.

Since the end of 2019, I have been primarily working with the Flutter framework and have contributed to the development of over 7 Flutter applications. I have experience working in diverse teams ranging from 2-3 members to larger teams of 10-15 people. I have also worked in English-speaking teams, including collaborating with German colleagues, involving daily calls and weekly discussions.

As a Flutter developer, I have gained experience in various areas, including healthcare applications, educational applications, personal account applications for cellular operators, taxi passenger applications, online radio station applications, delivery services applications, and driver/courier applications for delivery services.

In my previous role as a Ruby on Rails developer, my responsibilities included upgrading Ruby and RoR versions, migrating from Paperclip to ActiveStorage, optimizing sidekiq jobs, improving Ruby code resulting in a 40% reduction in server costs while maintaining functionality, managing git flow, providing team leadership to a team of 2 developers, conducting code reviews, migrating from ActionCable to AnyCable, implementing geo optimizations using Redis-geo, and pre-calculating prices for passengers based on routes considering high-cost areas, fixed-price areas, etc.

Overall, I am a dedicated and experienced software developer with a strong background in mobile and backend development and a passion for continuous learning and improvement.

Interviewer: Andy Smetana (Team/Tech Lead at SoftServe)
""The highlights of the Volodymyr performance in the current period:
1) Focused mostly on the BackEnd tasks, obtained good experience in EFCore / DB, learned integration testing practices, mastered Onion / Clean Architecture and CQRS pattern, worked with B2C authentication.
2) He is initiative and proactive in requirements discussion, proposing optimal tech solution for given business requirements.
3) During last months he became de-fact a tech lead, who conducted code reviews and consulted new / less experienced team members.
4) From downsides - he did not have variety of full stack tasks, many typical BackEnd assignments without enough space for design proposals and creative ideas.
5)  Overall, in the current company's culture and established business and dev processes - Volodya demonstrated good performance and delivered high-quality code to production.""

When I studied at university, I developed many programs that use mathematics to calculate different metrics and build close-up approximations for charts (spline interpolation, etc.) 
Also, I studied how to work with different connection methods(UDP, TCP, and HTTP) on a low level. My mates and I developed a desktop chat app and server for it to practice my knowledge. 

As my pet project, I develop a trading terminal that connects to Binance Exchange through web API. The central part of my work is a desktop app that uses SharpDX to draw real-time charts and achieve high performance and low CPU and RAM usage. Also, I developed a server that is used to handle payments and allow authorization of users as well as to store historical trading data.

Due to my studies at EPAM University, I have increased my knowledge in Web development and Client-Server app development. I studied advanced .Net and AngularJS. In my graduation project, I developed a client-server web app, ""Auction,"" that can be divided into parts:
1. Server-side .Net Core 3.1
  - DAL - Using Repository and Unit of Work.
  - BLL - Service development.
  - API - That calls services, authenticates users, etc.
  - Tests - Check the correctness of the program logic.

3. Database MSSQL
Technologies that I used:
• NUnit
• .NET Core 3.1
• ASP.NET Core (WEB API)
• Automapper

An experienced full-stack no-code / low-code developer, passionate about building optimized web and mobile applications using no-code tools such as bubble.io and Adalo. 

With over 2 years of experience, I have a strong foundation in developing dynamic and responsive prototypes, backend workflows, custom process logic and workflows, optimized database structure, and complex API integrations using a wide range of tools including  Bubble.io, Make, Zapier, HTML and CSS.

In my previous role, I worked with agencies such as a-Team Global, where I had the opportunity to develop custom applications for clients around the globe using bubble, and also drawing on my extensive background as an associate product manager and UIUX designer.

Here,  I was involved in diverse projects, with a notable presence in the educational and telecommunications, sectors.  In these domains, I designed and implemented various solutions, one of which is a custom sign-in portal that allows users to manage PBX (cloud telephony software for communication service), and to invite their team members and associates to their personal PBX. This portal is crucial in configuring users' cloud telephony service, validating users' info, and enhancing the capabilities of custom portaone telephony service.

One of the noteworthy projects I also worked on involved the development of an educational platform that allows tutors and students to practicalize what they've learned from taking courses on course streaming platforms such as Udemy and Coursera. This platform lets tutors create practice cases, and assign roles so students can play out roles in a live class and demonstrate the knowledge and strategies learned from the courses. This is particularly targeted at business and relational courses that involve activities such as negotiations, stakeholder management, and requirement gathering.

I have also worked on kwikinvoice, a platform that allows businesses and individuals to create and send out invoices to their clients for free. Users can generate invoices on the website and send them out to multiple clients at once. I played the role of a PM and bubble developer, leading a team of 2 designers,  and 1 other bubble developer to build the products and grow it to its first 1000 users.

I am certified by Dev&Design and I look forward to using my skills to build meaningful and amazing projects.
My expectations revolve around continuous learning, meaningful but challenging work, international exposure,  efficiency, and team growth.

Conversely, I aim for an opportunity that will allow me use my skills as a product manager, and designer in conjunction with my development skills."

full stack,"I`ve used to work with different domains, from product management systems, ecommerce to healthcare. When I start working on project, I always try to dig deeper into the problems to be able to find a best match when building a solution.

I have experience in working with teams as mentor, expanding my responsobilities not only on my code, but also on velocity and productivity of my team.
I`ve worked with a lot of direct customers.

I have expirience with both back and front-end. I`m currently building large applications and setting up the architecture for further iterations. In my projects Laravel is used for back-end and Vue or React frameworks as a base for front-end.

While development process I also like to participate in additional activities, such as code review, mentoring, estimation, communication with direct client and/or partners. I`m fond of new technologies and best practices, so all my projects are based on microservices approach and custom Laravel architecture, which allows me to scale application very easy.

On front-end, I`m big fan of React and Nuxt3 (with TypeScript of course). I love building nice-looking fast and reliable UI`s with the help of community best practices and patterns. I like moving product forward as a big team player: the sucess of team and customer is my highest achievement!

Throughout my professional journey, I have gained extensive experience by working with different companies on a wide range of projects. This diverse exposure has honed my skills in utilizing the React framework, specifically in conjunction with Next.js, for front-end development. Moreover, I have applied my expertise in Node.js, with a particular focus on the Nest.js framework, to build robust and scalable back-end solutions.

In my expertise, I have leveraged the React framework, specifically in combination with Next.js, for front-end development. React's component-based approach has allowed me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently. With Next.js, I've benefited from server-side rendering (SSR) and routing capabilities, enabling faster page loads and optimized client-side interactions.

For back-end development, my experience lies in utilizing Node.js, with a particular emphasis on the Nest.js framework. Nest.js is a powerful platform that adheres to best practices and SOLID principles, enabling me to create scalable and maintainable server-side applications. By leveraging Nest.js, I have structured my projects into modules, each with clear responsibilities and following the Single Responsibility Principle.
I am currently seeking employment, either in a part-time or full-time capacity, where I can continue my professional growth. My goal is to join a friendly and collaborative team, working together on a specific product or project.

Having had experiences in different work environments, I understand the value of a supportive team that fosters personal and professional development. I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a company that values teamwork, open communication, and a positive work culture.

In addition to the role itself, I am driven by the opportunity to work on a specific product or project. Being involved in the development and progression of a tangible product allows me to have a sense of ownership and pride in my work. It also provides a focused environment where I can utilize my skills to make a meaningful impact.

Overall, I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute my skills and knowledge while growing professionally. Being part of a friendly and supportive work environment, and having the opportunity to work on a specific product, are important factors in my job search. I look forward to finding the right opportunity that aligns with these aspirations."

In addition to exchange operations, I worked closely with a data engineering team of five to create 10 informative graphical charts to enhance the user experience.

One of the challenges we faced during the development process was the occurrence of minor discrepancies in the total amount of exchanged money. This was due to the use of a third-party, closed-source software for calculations within the system. After extensive investigation and collaboration, I developed a new calculation module to address this issue, enabling us to take full control of our own financial calculations.

"
full stack,"One of my most fulfilling accomplishments was the development of a school management system. This was a complex and challenging project that required me to utilize a range of technical skills and knowledge. I was responsible for designing and implementing the database schema and integrating the various modules of the system. The final product was well-received by the client and has been successfully used in schools to manage student records, tuition history, course information, and communication between teachers and administrators.

Another accomplishment I am proud of is my work on a project to build a robust event-driven mailing service. This required me to use AWS services such as SES (Simple Email Service) and SNS (Simple Notification Service) to handle the delivery and tracking of emails. The service I developed was able to handle high volumes of Email traffic and had a high delivery rate, which was a key requirement of the project.

In addition to these specific projects, I am also proud of my overall track record as a software engineer. Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered high-quality work on time and have received positive feedback from clients and colleagues. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the field.

This involves working with other team members to identify the requirements for a given project, designing and implementing a solution, and ensuring that the solution is properly tested and deployed. I'm also in charge of our DevOps, basically ensuring that the applications are properly configured and deployed to production.

I am always looking for ways to improve and stay at the top of my game. In the future, I hope to take on more leadership roles and contribute to the development of technical strategy within my team. I am also committed to staying up to date with the latest technologies and industry best practices, and am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
I have a few key expectations for my work.

First, I expect to be able to work on challenging and meaningful projects that allow me to utilize my technical skills and knowledge to make a positive impact. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer, and I believe that working on challenging projects is one of the best ways to do this.

I also expect to work with a team of dedicated and talented individuals who are committed to producing high-quality work. I believe that collaboration and teamwork are essential to the success of any project, and I enjoy being part of a team where everyone is willing to share ideas and support each other.

full stack,"Over the past several years, I've specialized in developing bots for MMO games. My primary projects have involved creating bots to automate various in-game tasks, such as fishing, transporting resources, and optimizing combat actions.

The technologies I frequently use include C++, C#, Python, and Lua. I've developed bots that leverage image recognition using OpenCV and other methods to interact with games at the system level.

Being a self-taught software engineer, I've single-handedly managed all stages of my projects, from design and development to final release and user support.

Due to the unique nature of my work, I've had to delve into almost every aspect of software development, ranging from low-level programming to setting up authentication servers. This field often doesn't have ready-made solutions, necessitating a rapid learning ability, resourcefulness, and persistence in addressing unconventional challenges. Therefore, while I am familiar with numerous frameworks and libraries, it's the breadth and adaptability of my experience that truly sets me apart.

I aspire to expand my expertise into other platforms and sectors where my automation and optimization skills can be applied.

2. Multi-process web-scraper. Able to identify bans, content distortion etc. Its custom server works with raw sockets and supports anonymization with proxies and SSH tunnels while scraping via https.

3. Content parser, capable to detect possible information conflicts and synonymic values, merge and split entities and all the related data based on moderator-approved synonyms.

Visual coding and bots:
1. Django application for visual programming from admin site. Doesn't require server restart for code changes to take effect. Implemented as a decision tree. Each block is a code section. Supports custom blocks of unlimited complexity.

2. On the base of previous point, developed a platform for building complex chat-bots from admin. It already has top flexibility among all the platforms I've seen. For now, it supports telegram and has a fully customizable web-chat widget. Supports payments, trading among users, multi-participant transactions (e.g. commissions, referral systems etc.), interacting with client’s website js API, custom entity types and much more.

I have worked on various projects as a developer, utilizing a range of technologies and frameworks. Some of the projects I have completed include:

Web and Mobile App Development

I have worked on a project where I collaborated with another developer to build a web and mobile app for a company's management needs. The web app was built using Ruby on Rails with both HTML and JSON responses, while the mobile app was built using React Native and consumed the API created by the Rails app. 

During this project, my responsibilities included:

- Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Building API using Ruby on Rails. I focused on designing and implementing robust endpoints, handling authentication and authorization, and ensuring data security.
- Ensuring that the app was user-friendly and responsive across multiple devices.
- Troubleshooting issues and implementing solutions as needed.
- Communicating progress and updates to project managers and stakeholders.

Throughout the project, I utilized my strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced environment. I effectively collaborated with the development team and delivered the project on time and within the specified requirements.

Technologies: React.js, Ruby on Rails, React Native, RSpec, Turbo,  Stimulus, PostgreSQL and Jest


In my current role, I work as a full-stack developer on a cross-functional team. My responsibilities include collaborating with designers and other developers to implement new features, writing clean and maintainable code, conducting code reviews, and troubleshooting issues as they arise. I actively participate in sprint planning, standup meetings, and retrospectives to ensure effective communication and collaboration within the team.

What I Want to Improve:

I am constantly striving to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of web and mobile app development. Some areas I am particularly interested in improving include:

Performance Optimization: I want to gain a deeper understanding of techniques and best practices for optimizing application performance, such as minimizing network requests, implementing caching strategies, and optimizing database queries.

Test-Driven Development: I aim to further strengthen my expertise in writing comprehensive unit tests and implementing test-driven development practices.
As a developer, I have certain expectations for the projects I work on. Here are some of my expectations:

Clear Requirements: I expect to receive clear and well-defined project requirements. This includes a detailed scope of work, expected deliverables, and any specific design or functionality guidelines. Having clear requirements helps me understand the project goals and ensures that I can meet the expectations of the stakeholders.

Collaboration and Communication: I value open and effective communication within the development team and with project managers and stakeholders. I expect regular meetings, such as stand-ups and sprint reviews, where we can discuss progress, address questions or concerns, and align on project priorities. Clear and timely communication helps me stay on track and deliver high-quality results.

Supportive Work Environment: I appreciate working in a supportive and inclusive work environment. Collaboration and teamwork are crucial for success, and I expect colleagues who are willing to help and share their knowledge. A positive work environment fosters creativity and productivity, allowing me to perform at my best.

What I Do NOT Want to Do:

While I am open to various challenges and tasks, there are a few things I prefer to avoid:

Unsupported Legacy Technologies: I prefer not to work extensively with outdated technologies or frameworks that have limited community support or are no longer actively maintained. However, I understand that in some cases, working with legacy code may be necessary, and I am willing to handle such tasks when needed.

Overly Tight Deadlines: Unrealistic deadlines can negatively impact the quality of work and create unnecessary stress. I prefer to work on projects with reasonable timeframes that allow for proper planning, development, and testing. Having adequate time ensures that I can deliver high-quality results and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Lack of Clarity and Communication: Unclear project requirements and poor communication can hinder progress and lead to misunderstandings. It is important for me to have clear expectations and open lines of communication with the project team and stakeholders to ensure a smooth workflow and a successful project outcome.

By aligning on these expectations and avoiding the pitfalls mentioned, I believe we can create a productive and collaborative working environment that fosters success."

I successfully made the transition from static HTML/CSS to the React framework, where I learnt how to work with components and states.

I have also been involved in the development of a group project called ""Kabbage"" using the React framework, where I used various React features, such as React Hooks and Redux.

I am always interested in learning new technologies and constantly strive to develop my skills. In the future, I plan to improve my knowledge of back-end development to become a full-stack developer.

I am very interested in discovering new opportunities and working on interesting projects. If you are looking for a talented and dedicated front-end developer, I will be happy to join your team.
My work experience consists of various projects in which I played the role of a developer. One of my projects was the IceCream project, in which I used Parcel, SCSS and JS technologies. The goal of this project was to create an ice cream company website with a user-friendly and beautiful design, as well as a responsive layout.

My next project was a WebStudio, where I used HTML, SASS, Parcel, and JS. This project was also focused on responsive layout with a burger menu, modal window, and beautiful design.

I am currently working as a developer in another project where I use React, Node.js, and MongoDB. My role is to develop and maintain the functionality of the site, create new features, and debug the code.

In the future, I would like to develop in the field of web application development, especially in the front-end.

I expect that my work will involve a lot of information, as I am interested in working with and analysing data. I am also ready to learn new things and use new technologies to improve my skills and abilities.

I consider myself a responsible and attentive person who pays attention to details and always strives to achieve the best results. I am not afraid of changes and am ready to accept challenges to achieve my goals.

I am looking for a company that shares my values and can offer interesting projects where I can develop and learn. I want to work in a team with open-minded and creative people who are ready to cooperate and achieve common goals.

I possess a strong enthusiasm for the merits and optimal methodologies of Golang. Continuously seeking avenues to further enrich my understanding of the language, my experience extends beyond Golang to encompass languages like Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Solidity. This diverse proficiency has been instrumental in establishing a robust bedrock in the realm of software development. Moreover, my ardor for server development runs deep, supported by a wealth of substantial experience in this domain.
Interested in developing servers using Go. The best combination for me - Golang + Blockchain. I am fond of these two technologies, and really enjoy developing Back-end, or Blockchain applications. 
I am curious about Dev Ops and Cybersecurity side as well. If your company have such department, it would be nice if I can visit it time to time :) . However, I am good learner by myself, so I will definitely evolve in this fields."

I have experience in uncommercial development. I have been developing for four years, during this time I have tried many different technologies and tried these technologies in practice while developing my projects.

I have experience in website development, and for this, I use technologies such as PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, and React, I also have experience with angular.

I also have an interesting pure PHP project in which I tried to implement the MVC pattern by creating an engine for connecting routes, resume_classifier, and controllers, and also made my own small ORM.

I worked a lot with .NET, for example, there is a project, a task manager called Deadline, I did all the visual parts on WinForms, and I tried to make a separate library in order to make this application network, I tried to make a library similar to SocketIO from JS.
 
I have a good experience in database development, I developed them from a leaflet scheme to queries, and I can work with MySql and MS SQL Server.

Group projects provided me with an interesting experience of simulating a real project, including team division into developers, team lead, and scrum master roles, tight timing due to an approaching deadline, overtime, and, of course, project presentation. In one of the projects, I acted as a team lead, which provided me with experience in reviewing the entire team's code, solving problems created by both human factors and technical issues. Individual projects gave me the opportunity to independently make decisions in solving various tasks. 
The training program included working with ""old-school"" code, such as working with tables in CSS, creating applications using vanilla Redux, and using class components in React. This has equipped me to work with legacy code.
As a career switcher (a sailor, navigator-engineer in the past), I successfully transferred skills and qualities from my previous job that are needed in this industry.

Javascript project:
1. Coctail searching App - This is a group project created after studying the JavaScript block. The application is a cocktail search service. In this project, I implemented the gallery section and everything related to it: styles, rendering, custom pagination (the backend did not allow pagination of requests), and an adaptive interface. I also worked on backend requests for cocktail Name search, random cocktail requests for rendering the main page, and requests for cocktails starting with a specific letter.

ReactJS Project: 
1. Wallet App - This is a group project created after studying React. The application represents a personal ""wallet', which allows users to monitor their decuctions and incomes. Each user can signup and signin to have personal account for monitoring their personal deductions. Redux and ReduxToolkit used for state managment.

Under my leadership, we developed a highly functional web application for movie search. Through effective delegation and coordination, we were able to utilize the skills and strengths of each team member to their fullest potential. I provided clear direction, set achievable goals, and ensured that everyone had the necessary resources and support to excel in their respective roles.

Through my strong organizational and communication skills, I facilitated seamless collaboration among team members, promoting effective problem-solving and decision-making. I encouraged open dialogue, listened to diverse perspectives, and fostered a culture of mutual respect and teamwork.
During my professional experience, I have actively participated in two team projects that have allowed me to enhance my skills and contribute to successful outcomes.

In the second project, I had the opportunity to take on the role of a team lead. Our objective was to develop a web application for movie search, offering users detailed information about films. As the team lead, I provided guidance and coordination to ensure efficient project execution. We employed various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Axios for API requests, pagination for seamless movie browsing, and local storage to enable users to save movies to their queue or mark them as watched.

These experiences have not only expanded my technical proficiency but also honed my leadership skills and ability to collaborate effectively within a team setting.

I have experience in various projects.

At the beginning of my career, I worked on a project with technologies such as ASP.NET MVC 5, WebApi, WPF, Windows Service, C # unit tests, Selenium automated tests, T-SQL and Javascript. The project is associated with the integration of services and is a personal account of the user. I mainly worked on writing new features, fixing bugs, refactoring, and writing tests. Worked there for about a year and two months.

The next step was to switch to a new company with another project using the micro-service architecture, where the Back-side was written in C # (WebApi, Entity), and the Front-side was the Angular 5 platform. I worked there for nine months, most of the time I worked on fixing bugs and writing new features.

After these projects, I started working in another company and wrote a small project. It was a 3D File browser. I used micro-service architecture and frameworks/services such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Moongoose, Babel, Yarn, Jest, .NET Core 3.0, Entity Framework Core, Angular 8, Angular Material, MobX, Karma, Protractor.

Then, after the project was completed, I switched to work on another project using the React Framework, MobX, etc., I only worked on the Frond-End side.

Also, I'm a DotSpatial library contributor.
I started my career as a junior GIS specialist in 2014. Throughout these years I worked on attributing of all levels of the maps used in navigation. I've been performing various project roles and my current position is a Team lead.

- eliciting GIS project requirements;
- working the angles with the customer via emails and meetings;
- supporting the team on the complicated coding cases;
- managing the project workflow;
- invention and implementation of desktop tools for different project needs (using C#, WPF).

I have enough experience working in a team and experience working with someone else's code. Currently I working on university graduate work (Bachelor thesis).

Projects that I managed to do during the university, and which deepened my knowledge about the web programing:
1) Telegram bot, Anime wiki-bot based on MyAnimeList database open API. First experience in back-end development. Using ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQLite, Azure.
2) Database for register of land plots and their owners with ability to build a topological map. Improved database design skills. Using MySQL and MySQLWorkbench.
3) Web application to support the work of the library. Authorization, user and admin roles, searching, filters, catalog of books, books info pages, books by authors, user's personal account, books borrowing, admin pages, CRUD (books, genres, authors, sections), users debts control. Improved in web programing skills, in back-end and front-end technologies. Using Node.js (Express.js), React (Redux), MySQL (Sequelize.js).

I worked on this project as a team with my friend, purpose was to learn the Angular framework from scratch on a real example. As mentioned before, the client part is built using Angular, web server is developed using C#, in particular ASP.NET Core framework, Entity Framework used as ORM, and the database is designed using the PostgreSQL management system. Already implemented registration and authorization based on JWT, wishlist, product search, reviews, and much more, but there's a lot left to do, so I will continue to work on further enhancing this project independently.

Application is built using React Native framework and SQLite as DB. All fundamental operations have been implemented, also you can see your tasks in the built-in calendar, which displays dates with start or end of tasks.

Fast learning - maybe is my main skill. So I can do almost everything related to work with laptop.

FullStack Developer =)
I used to work on various outsourcing agencies, companies, and startups as a full-time contractor and as a freelancer as well. I have experience in building web apps like eCommerce, CRM-systems, CMS, landing pages, accounting services, bots, content generating scripts, etc.  

I was responsible for researching, and implementing a bunch of different solutions on the architecture level. Like finding better third party solutions that should match different requirements (technical compatibility, maintainability, fault tolerance, and so on).

 I really like to find pain points and work on solutions for making workflows better as much as possible.  

Usually workflows - it is synergy of different tools. I’m always trying to make processes better (for the entire team, clients, investors etc.). At the same time - I like to optimize expenses (servers, third party solutions etc.) I like to build projections (traffic, expenses, etc.) and work on scaling and optimization.  

On security side - I prefer to double-check everything. I experienced in project optimization/preparation for SOC2 audits (Logical and physical, access controls, System operations, Change management, Risk mitigation, etc.). Preparation for Enterprise caliber clients onboarding (security, user management, fault tolerance, etc).

  I'm persistent and purposeful, especially when I'm around my laptop. That soft skill makes me good in investigations/debugging/planning processes. I feel the passion when I see mystery errors. I won't give up until the problem is fixed. I like to work on preventing performance issues more than on fixing, but life happens.

full stack,"Couple of achievements in my career that i'm proud of and can elaborate on the interview:

1. Built an architecture of one of the key company products, in tight cooperation with Product Manager, CTO and development team; further leading the implementation and release.
2. Established an architecture of the new app iteration, by conducting team brainstormings, translating and solving the concerns to the Product Manager, and eventually implementing the ideas to the reality / production.
3. Successfully refactored the FE app which became hard to support, by applying the right design principles (pub/sub, modules, state management etc.) and the TDD.
4. Introduced the DDD principles to one of the services owned by a team, by giving an example, then driving further migration;
5. Solved complex data discrepancy issue under pressure, in a very tight timeline, delivering an important data in time. This was the time during Christmas holidays, when i just started in a new company and had very limited understanding about the product. Nevertheless i’ve managed to write the scripts to analyze the data retroactively, which helped to retain a major customer.
6. My advanced debugging and reverse-engineering skills helped me to resolve the most complex and challenging tasks many times. Sometimes by contributing to the underlying OS libraries we used. There are no unsolvable issues: it all depends on the right effort and time

Hi there :)
My main experience is writing REST APIs on Node.js and front-end to it on React.
Also, I do love configuration servers, so mainly on projects I was participating in all those aspects.

Backend technologies I used: Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Express, JWT, Selenium
Backend cool stuff I did: queue managing by Bull/Redis, filesystem for AWS remote servers, Facebook scrapping with Selenium, sockets managing.
I am a fan of pure Node.js when it comes to the backend, but have experience working with frameworks/libraries a lot too

Frontend technologies I used: React.js, Redux, Bootstrap
Frontend cool stuff I did: real-time by sockets, file upload by base64, lazy loading
Honestly, I am not a fan of doing visuals, but I do enjoy making some cool functionality on the front end.

DevOps technologies I used: AWS, Digital Ocean, Redis, Gitlab, GitHub
DevOps cool stuff I did: Frontend auto-deploy on an S3 bucket, Backend auto-deploy on a remote server, AWS Logs, server configuration (project user, server logs, monitoring, crash strategies), S3 filesystem configuration, Nginx setup, Load balancing.
I LOVE DevOpsing and will do anything on it, the harder the better

At the moment I am working on a project which scraps ads for Facebook. I work on this project alone, so I single handed made frontend (React), backend (Express, Node.js), and scrapper (Node.js). Deploying on the server is on me too of course :)

Mostly I was working on product companies, which I really liked because there you can see people who are interested in the project as much as you are. My work is really personal for me, I get really invested in the stuff that I do and do struggle with a bit of perfectionism which is not always good, because sometimes I can't just “leave something for later”, especially when I know this “later” is never gonna come and the functionality will just crash. But I understand that we do not live in an ideal world, and sometimes things like that are needed too, just not too much :) 
I look for a company that can give me clearly set tasks and in which I could care for the technical side of the project only, hope we’ll match!
I do not want to be involved in the business side of a project too much. Not a fan of HTML/CSS"

For the last 9 years I have been working at the National Bank of Ukraine. During this period, I gained a huge professional experience in various fields (from the 1st Category engineer in the Security Department to the Chief Software Engineer in the IT Department). For the last 4 years I have been working as a Full-stack/PHP Symfony developer and handling a variety of role-related responsibilities: creating new and supporting existing websites (including layout, interface development and adaptive design), developing web services for external and internal users of the organization etc. I have experience in designing database structures (Doctrine + MySQL). At the beginning of my programmer career, I had little experience in projects that were developed on the ASP.NET MVC Framework + MSSQL.

I have a master's degree in information security (technical information security). Also, in order to organize and to validate my knowledge, which I acquired through self-education, I took advanced PHP and JavaScript courses.

I can work on multiple projects at once and still maintain efficiency and meet deadlines. Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, I have been working remotely, still performing my tasks efficiently and on time.

- A successful initiative for university students
During my high school education, I was interested in various software areas and turned to the web area. By taking my university education on Management Information Systems, I took accounting, HR, law as well as database, oop, and various software courses that will serve as a bridge between software and human relations. However, in the first year of my university life, I became one of the company partners by joining the team of universitev.com, a web initiative targeting university students. In order to develop our project and meet the R&D costs, we also established a software company called 'ifeelcode' in this process. Here, too, we offered a wide range of products such as website, e-commerce systems, erp, crm, as well as logo design, corporate identity design, promotional film. In a period of 1 year, the number of our employees has exceeded 20 people. By playing an active role in all processes, I gained experience in a company established from scratch in the fields of company management and project development management. Then, by selling the subsidiary company we established with sufficient funding for our main project, which is the main purpose of the company we established, we turned into a company whose sole job is a project, and we continued to develop our project by publishing it. In our ongoing project, my role in R&D and software continues as well as my managerial partnership.

I can list the experiences I have gained in the sector where I have worked for more than 5 years as follows;

    PHP - Laravel | Symfony - Mvc structure

Hi,
I'm a software developer, that focuses on development of mobile and web applications, with a touch on backend development. Also, complex UIs, hardware integrations, smart watch and desktop app development. I work since 2012 and with lots of projects for different purposes, commercial software as well as startups, mostly for small companies. I like to work with projects from scratches, prototyping architecture, keeping it flexible and up to date with new tech, clear code that is well understood. For existing projects, I can refresh stale codebase, typify and upgrade with code quality enhancements or make a complete code redesign using best practices, gradually.

I also like to build good UIs and have a successful track record on using cross-platform Javascript-based tools and the magic of React Native to unify codebase, patterns and tools as much as possible to improve app maintainability, and RN for Web that could help with an expansion of supported platforms as well.

I can use serverless tech or create backend service to serve app needs. If app needs to sustain higher loads, I can dig into existing tech and practices, reducing bottlenecks to build a scalable solution.

If you have an idea or some designs for mobile or web app, I can work with them, transforming it into a working system with a UI.

full stack,"One of the recent tasks I was doing was to implement a table with sessions in front and back. There are several columns in this table (login, IP, Branch, login date, expiredSession). The problem was that two people, in different places with different IP can login as one user, and you need to have two entries in the table and create a new session with a new sessionID for each login. When using cookie-based session state, ASP.NET does not allocate storage for session data until the Session object is used. As a result, a new session ID is generated for each page request until the session object is accessed. If application requires a static session ID for the entire session, we can either implement the Session_Start method in the application's Global.asax file and store data in the Session object to fix the session ID.

Project

-Project Team Size: 3 people;

Tools & Technologies: .Net 6, ASP.NET, Entity Framework (Code First), MS SQL
Server, GitHub
 Protocols: OAuth 2.0, Oidc
 Libraries: OpenIdDict
 Flows: Authorization Code flow with PKCE

-Description:
Authorization server with generation of self-contained access token which supports different kinds of flows for different clients (confidential and public ones). For public clients it’s used Authorization Code flow with PKCE according to OAuth2.0 standards to prevent clients tampering and ensure that data of the user can only be received by authenticated apps.
Each jwt-token contains different claims. The claims include scopes and basic user information such as Email, time the token was issued, expiration time etc. Having this kind
of information, different APIs can decrypt and validate tokens by themselves. The most obvious benefit of this approach is that there is no need to store tokens and to make
additional requests to the Auth Server for token introspections.

"
full stack,"Did contribution in an open-source project. I’ve been in a dev team (actually, I am still in) of a big project.
I am a junior+ python dev/full-stack developer. I have over a year of commercial experience. My main programming language is python. I worked with Django, Flask and Pylons frameworks.

I worked on creating the open data portals with DMS based on Flask. Also, we used SOLR to index data and optimize search process.

Also, I have an experience with JavaScript (vanilla js, Marko.js, jQuery, React+Redux) and PHP (Drupal 7/8, WordPress). Interested to work with Golang.

I am familiar with Linux (Mint, Ubuntu), currently working with Ubuntu 19.04. I have a small practice with shell scripts.

I knew HTML/CSS (less, sass).

I have a basic knowledge of automation testing (selenium, beautifulsoup, pytest, unittest, nose) and manual testing (smoke tests, sanity tests, regression testing etc).

I've made a few telegram bots (telebot, aiogram) and multiple parsers (beautifulsoup). Also, experienced with REST API and a little bit GraphQL (graphene).

Agile/Scrum/Jira.
It would be great to work in a product company, since I have an experience with an outsource already.

I have a practice with layout but I'm not interested in it no more. I would like to distance from it and focus on a back-end development.

Also, I'm not attracted with CMS, including those mentioned before (Drupal, WP).
 
It's nice if you are using Golang in your development process. I would like to gain a commercial experience with it. 

My expectations:
 - Friendly team with strong team lead
 - Interesting projects
 - Flexible hours
 - English lessons
 - You’ve read the profile"

- I developed a library for the convenient operation of the rights system in the Laravel + Vue bundle. With this library, it becomes convenient to work with the granting or restriction of user rights to work with different Vue components in the app (in the possibility or prohibition of viewing, updating, creating or deleting data in the component) and simultaneous monitoring on the server-side of these actions.
- I developed a library for easy working with the Laravel API when requesting API from a Vue.js app. The Vue app can always have updated data and can update its from external event from Laravel Echo via a web socket. This library has a simple configuration file and a variety of data formatting tools for convenient use in an app (when retrieving simple data from a database from a server without any join or formatting). This library significantly reduces server-side code.
- I developed a RactiveJS-based library which allows to build interface for complex scalable apps with reactivity support and  hierarchy of reusable components/resume_classifier. This library was used to develop a financial app.
- Developed a table component that allows to display thousands of lines of data in a specified viewport. It's used in the financial app, too.
- Developed a jQuery-based library to manage tabular data. This library extends Dtable.js.
PHP: 
- I developed own scraper for websites.
- I developed a library for PHP/SQL with a GraphQL-similar approach.

I was responsible for feature development, code optimization, performance improvement, and team management. Prior to that, I've worked on a variety of projects, including an advertising aggregator, an e-commerce platform, and an automated security issue fixing platform.

My technical skills span across a wide range of areas. I have a deep understanding of microservices architecture and have used Python with FastAPI and Celery, as well as Node.js with Nest.js, Express, Koa, and Fastify for building robust back-end services.

I also have experience in building web extensions. For styling, I've utilized Material UI and Emotion, and have leveraged WebPack, Babel, and Vite for bundling and transpiling.

Hello,
My Name is Maksym
I’m Senior Full stack developer
with 7 years of commercial experience

Technologies
Usually I work with .Net, .Net Core, SQL, MongoDB, WebApi, RabbitMQ, Angular.

PROJECTS
Let me share my experience with past projects.
Several years ago I worked within a World famous game studio called Plarium as Backend Developer. We create a game which you can get from PlayMarket and AppStore - it’s called Rio. There were 70 people and about 10 teams: Artists, 3D animators, GameDesign team, frontend team, marketing team, etc. The most popular technologies were .Net, Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Angular, Unity3D. Part of the time we developed the architecture from scratch for our brand new game because we had to make it very fast and reactive. Also we implemented all the game logic, same as the administrative site and analytics. We integrated PowerBI system to track gamers activity in our application. By the way, all this time I was the one person responsible for CI and CD, those I implemented from the scratch by teamcity and a self written deployment tool which was integrated into TC.
The second interesting project I want to share with you is: SKS365. It’s the biggest betting platform with a great amount of brands and web-sites underneath. There were about 20 distributed teams all over the europe. They used .Net, WebApi, RabbitMQ, Angular, WCF, Redis. WinForms, Silverlight, SQL, CSS, JS, JQuery, ASP.NET.MVC. Most part of my tasks was to integrate new payment methods from the bottom up to top, including UI part, database, 3-rd party payment APIs, the APIs written by our colleagues etc.

I fill myself to be strong in
Database development
.NET backend
Angular development
Able to quickly learn new Software Development practices, technologies, business domain rules with passion
I feel confident in CI CD setup
Easy switch between priority tasks.

During my career, I've been involved in building large enterprise systems, rapid startup development, and MVP implementation as part of an RnD team.

I can call myself an advocate of Clean Code and KISS methodologies and always teach my team how to benefit from them at work.
It’s not a big deal to me to speak in front of an audience and I am always happy to share my achievements with colleagues or customers. That's why I have several public speeches on technical topics and continue to work on new ones.

Over the course of my career, I have changed several jobs. The main reasons for my departure were bad management, lack of strategic thinking of business owners, low pay or disinterest of companies in the growth of their employees.

-----

In an age where technology is incrementally expanding, there is no doubt that programmers and engineers are people who make it happen. The important thing to remember is that good programmers are not those who can write code fast, but those who write it RIGHT and only the best can combine the two. I consider myself one of those people, not necessarily by writing the BEST code there is, but by the ability to learn by mistake and coding in a reusable manner so that everyone can benefit from my contributions.

With all that said we should not forget that sometimes even those technologically gifted need an insight from non-technical people. So I'm very much open to expanding my horizons by learning from open minded people who have revolutionary ideas that are not quite picked up yet by our current society.

To those people I say: Drop a line and we'll take it from there...

I have a rich experience of working on quite large projects (from the point of view of functionality and number of entities involved: source code, units, classes, tables and other DB objects, 3rd party components).

I think I'm good in working with complex apps, including written by other people. I don't feel myself uncomfortable working with somebody else's code and do not strive to rewrite everything from scratch.

Worked as systems architect (in my responsibility area in team), and also as team lead. I believe that there's no impossible tasks, everything depends on client's requirements and budget; but we don't have always do word for word as customer wants - common sense, experience and team will always help you to find an optimal solution.

full stack,"It was a quite complex project from the point of view of the front-end. The task was to make a constructor that would allow agencies to create statistics reports for their clients.

The constructor allows you to place widgets on the page in the way that the agency needs. By setting the dimensions, position and display styles agency gets their unique report without knowledge of HTML and CSS. Widgets display both static information, such as Text, and data received from the server, including tables, graphs, metrics, and so on.

Each widget has its own editor with unique fields for editing: Text, selection from a list, enabling and disabling displayed columns in a table, remembering sorting in a table, etc

My commercial experience as a programmer began in May 2019. I started working in the IT department of a local company specializing in industrial construction design as a junior .NET developer. As a part of a team, I was working on a construction management software system, consisting of a few desktop apps, a web app, and a bunch of plugins for third-party software. I evolved into a middle full-stack .NET+JS dev and was the one trusted with the most difficult programming tasks we had. After the project left the active development stage I felt I was ready to move forward and found a job in another company, in which I continue to work as a full-stack developer within an experienced international team for foreign customers.
I mainly focus on full-stack web programming, although interesting desktop or mobile projects are still good to go. I'm looking forward to working on challenging ambitious projects with positive people. Being a part of a multinational team primarily using English (like my current team is) would be great.

Not interested in supporting old legacy applications using some obsolete technology stack. It's a sure way to stop evolving and lose further prospects, and I want to keep up with the times and face new challenges. I'm always ready to acquire new knowledge and skills as well as improve my existing ones. 

I'm generally interested in a long-term collaboration. However, some short-time though gripping projects are welcome.

Remote employment is highly preferred. Life is too short to waste it in public transport or traffic jams. I will only accept an exceptional office job offer.
Official employment and any help with a work visa in the EU country would be a huge plus as I'm not planning to return to Ukraine in the foreseeable future.

I'm not a fan of any kind of obligatory team building or any similar group activities unrelated to my direct responsibilities. Being forced to attend any of these is a drawback for me. I also don't care about any 'sweeteners' like free cookies in the office or a free gym, as I won't use any of this anyway.

I'm a self-taught software developer, who made his way into programming by spending lots of evenings and weekends learning stuff while having a demanding full-time job. If you are looking for a diploma, not for real skills, performance, and persistence, please save your time, I'm not your candidate. However, I'm ready to consider attending some educational courses to fill in this gap if it's beneficial for long-term cooperation with your company."

full stack,"When was a team lead the team under my leadership developed the system from monolith to microservices using Clean architecture, some practices from DDD and Event Sourcing.
Integrated different practices (part of them were not adopted before I took this position): code review, using GoF's patterns, unit-testing, some Scrum events (backlog refinement, demo, retro), estimating using Story points, holding User story mapping, created DoRs and DoDs. 
As an engineer, developed a startup's MVP from scratch, created custom servers' health monitors and a project for analyzing applications’ Logs almost single-handedly. Enriched projects' code agility and scalability with some patterns, created boilerplates for microservices, refactored projects. Created guidelines to use some CI/CD processes, kept documentation organized.

Moreover, I continue developing my professional skills on a daily basis by taking job-related online courses, reading books, guides and articles. 
Apart from hard skills, I have developed managing and negotiating skills. I have experience in integrating and using a lot of Agile and Scrum practices.
I have been working as a software developer for 6 years. At least 5 of them I’ve been working with .NET technologies. 

It is important for me to work on a project in a responsible manner, design systems to be flexible and easy to extend and maintain, using modern best practices and principles.

Participated in 3 projects on Upwork as a lead/senior software developer. 
As a lead I was responsible for managing this project and a small team (one more dev and QA), meeting with the client, gathering requirements. Also, architecturing solutions, taking technical decisions. As a software engineer was implementing features, created and fixed complex SQL queries. Gain really useful experience developing a startup's MVP from scratch almost single-handedly. 

 * Team lead and Sr. Software engineer, Corporates credit management system at bank.
As a team lead I was responsible for was designing the system as flexible and scalable, facilitating technical refinements. But also was developing features as a software engineer. Was managing dev team and its processes, adopting technical standards, mentoring, conducting interviews.

In this project, I completely created the header and added functionality in the search field and the ""My Library"" mode switch. And also in the ""My Library"" menu the ""watched"" and ""queue"" buttons.

- Books reading [ Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Swagger ]
In this project, I worked with the backend. My tasks included creating authorization endpoints (login/register/logout/google auth.) and I used swagger to write the documentation.
I'm a FullStack developer looking for a full-time position at the company. I have knowledge of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB. 
In addition, I have hands-on experience in following the Agile/Scrum methodology when working in a team. I'm learning fast, responsible and ready for challenging tasks. I want to improve my knowledge and skills and bring benefits to the company"
full stack,"I have been programming since 2007. I have been engaged in web development since 2009.
 I was fullstack for the last 7 years, but the last 3 years mostly frontend.
 My last pet-project DreamStation.App
I worked on a lot of different projects. For example, some of them were related to advertising and trade, and others were about the use of ML in the field of construction. I implemented:
 - dashboards,
 - users' personal accounts,
 - admin panels for different roles,
 - complex dynamic forms, wizards,
 - interactive maps,
 - landing pages...
 For the last 6 years I have been Senior for my own in small teams on all projects. But I realized that I just want to stay Middle (or even Junior) - to minimize communications, to maximize coding and self-learning. I like to feel that there are opportunities for growth.
I am interested in a product Company or a promising startup.
 I'm just looking for stable, mutually comfortable cooperation - well-formulated tasks and decent Salary for their implementation.
 - Without video/audio, only written  communications, please
 - Without bureaucracy
 - Flexible work schedule
 - Good team
I prefer the KISS principle and the functional approach.
 Asynchronous written communications are the most productive. I don't like spoken communications at all - it is the worst form and the root cause of all mankind's problems, I think.
I am looking for a job urgently. Therefore, if the hiring process takes weeks/months, then please warn about it."
