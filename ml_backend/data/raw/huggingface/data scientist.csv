I gained vast experience in payroll administration, invoicing, cost reporting, journal entries and tax reporting both in public sector and the world’s leading engineering companies where I became proficient user of a large range of data management systems and software including Excel, ERP and Oracle. Massive amounts of information have been an integral part of my job during my career. For example; each timesheets contain of a number of project codes, cost centers, member IDs, employee names, project hours, booking dates, submission, approval dates etc which requires high competency and analytical skills while extracting report for any reporting period. Sometimes it took more than thirty minutes to extract thousands of timesheets data from the system due to the volume of the data in order to prepare cost reports, payroll reports and other types of management reports. My strong analytical skills and being professional Excel user succored me at those critical times. In addition, I have excellent communication skills which my positions required from me to ensure me success at working in multinational environments. My ability to work well in a multinational team has been demonstrated in a number of group projects.

A bit about myself:
In 2013, I started working as a technical support specialist in the hosting provider company Megahoster.Net. 

Gradually, I started getting deeper into the tasks of system administration and programming and worked on a huge amount of various issues in this field.

During my work I faced code errors, inefficient and redundant code, and routine tasks which could be optimized - it drove me to start studying programming and I started getting into several programming languages which were necessary to solve issues(PHP, JS, Python).

Also, I passed courses on Computer Hardware and Computer Science, during that time I was studying C through a classic book by Kernighan and Ritchie ""The C Programming Language"" as a language close to programming hardware. I did enjoy the straightforward approaches and the language.

I like automating things and doing my work I follow the UNIX paradigm of making small and efficient tools.

At this time, I actively study math and take courses in math and machine learning.

I'm looking for a Junior Data Scientist position.

data scientist,"The main achievement of my last work was that I pitched an idea for the portfolio allocation trading framework and prepared a running code for it. The result is that a couple of specific realizations of that framework got fundings and have been running live for almost two years now.

I led the development of the ML model, which takes an individual trading strategy as input and assesses its risk profile. Based on this profile, you can tweak a decision of how much funds to put into that strategy.

Areas/task examples:
1. ML based predictions for stock/commodities markets. I was responsible for the process of designing and building a predictive model: defining objectives, data preparation, feature engineering, feature importance, model training, optimal params search, comparing results across ML models, sharing thoughts and recommendations on the final results.

Data Science Intern at outsource company in Lviv (2019-2020, 1 year)

Products similarity project. The main goal was to build a ranking products system based on a notion of similarity. That similarity defined in terms of various product features (textual, numerical and images), and the final measure is a composed score of those features.
My responsibilities were: provide ideas of how the final model should work, implement them (functions that get scores from images/numerical attributes + main functions which process all the information and create rankings).

Real-time human-machine interactions project. The main idea was to create a pipeline that takes a video stream as input and detects/recognize motions, gestures and faces.
My responsibilities were: research for existing models, create several parts of the pipeline (using pretrained models via transfer learning + I trained gesture recognition classifier), and code the final model's logic (logic of when, how and which individual parts should be activated).

I was responsible for making final presentations and case studies for both projects.
I worked a lot with ML in finance and would be happy to continue, but I am also open to proposals in other areas. I am deeply interested in various kinds of optimization problems. I believe that the data-driven approach can make a huge difference for businesses. I search for a company that values that too.

McKinsey&Company Prohack
This is an anonymized dataset provided by the one of the most prestigious consulting
companies around the world that operate in many countries including Azerbaijan. In this
task, I had to predict the target value (“y”) given all the other features. Throughout this
task, I completed all the advanced necessary steps and all of the necessary phases encompassing the CRISP-DM framework to successfully build an in-house prediction model
for a regression problem. The main objective was to extract new meaningful features from
the existing ones. Target encoder was used for categorical variable transformation. Target encoder is prone to inducing overfitting which was prevented via calling the KFoldTargetEncoderTrain class and removing a Galaxy category from the dataset that do
not exist in the test set. Outliers were handled via IQR method.


Electricity Contract Selection (2022)
This particular project covers step-by-step implementation of advanced Data Cleaning
techniques that are required to get a data to be ready before the Modelling phase in
accordance to the CRISP-DM framework. All steps were completed on Python programming language with the assistance of Pandas, Numpy and Re (Regex) libraries and
their built-in functions. Furthermore, certain functions that allow us to reorganize and manipulate data were compared with regards to computational time to my self-written
functions, because checking time-consumption and computational effectiveness of a code
is often an overlooked aspect of programming. 

Image classification with Python (2021)
Given the Image Classification dataset consists of 6 classes, I am
asked to build a model that can correctly classify images. I applied a
method called transfer learning and tried three neural networks
architectures: VGG16,Resnet50 and Inception-v3 Build a neural model.

My leading technologies used for delivering this work are SAS and SQL.
My communication skills and experience in the field led me to pick up a mentor role for the company interns, helping them develop a solid knowledge of the technologies and domain specifics.
I am passionate about insights and the quality of decisions based on data analysis so I always strive for knowledge. I learned how to solve complex data science problems with the tools of Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy).
My previous experience also includes 1 year as a Sales Analyst for an outsourcing company which helped me develop my communication skills and the understanding of marketing and sales departments.
I am looking for a new challenging job. My first priority would be a Data Scientist position but I'm open to considering other data-related roles. Likewise, I am considering different types of companies but product companies are preferred."
data scientist,"
During my studies I participated in many different projects connected with Data Analysis and Mathematical modelling as I am enrolled in the Master's program in Physics. First of all, I've participated in Particle Physics Summer Student Programme, where I was working on an analysis of the data collected in 2017 by the ATLAS experiment at CERN during a period of collisions of beams of xenon nuclei. The task was to read the information on reconstructed charged particles and present their properties in the form of histograms created using the ROOT programming framework in order to find the corrections which then were applied to
the results of measurements. 
Starting from December 2020, I've been working in the science group on Transport of topological excitations in atomic circuits under National Research Foundation of Ukraine grant. Using MATLAB we are simulating the physicals systems and analyzing their behavior. Now we're currently working on the developing the methods for the accounting of stochastic effects in our system. Collecting data from 3000 different simulations gives us the possibility to find a correlations between the important physical quantities.
Despite my enrollment into the scientific project, I have interest to work non-scientific fields as well. Due to my mathematical background I'm looking forward in developing and succeeding in the field of Data Analysis, Data Science and Neural Networks.

Before becoming a DS I spend 5 years in sociology\market research, mostly working with quantitative tasks (design and analysis of surveys).

Can share github profile and some articles (not research papers) on request.
- product company (not fintech, not gambling \ betting)
- possibility to contact directly with product \ marketing team or other internal customer for better implementation of ideas
- user behavior analysis as main part of work. Would be great to have also another tasks (text \ images \ geo processing, etc) - I do not have commercial experience with it, but I'd like to apply what I know and learn new things
- team of data scientist \ data engineers (not a single person in company)
- possibility to work remotely, at least part of the time, is a big advantage"
data scientist,"My last big project involved creating a system of sentiment analysis for Ukrainian and Russian language basically from nothing: I took part in designing the annotation guidelines and annotation processing, and then I have found the best tools for the job and built a good deep learning model which is now used in production.
For 3 years I have worked as data analyst in a think tank (working with datasets concerning economy and society in Ukraine and other countries).
After completing Data Science Summer School in Lviv and intensive 3-month Natural Language Processing (NLP) course from Projector, I started working as data scientist in a small company called Semantrum. My job included managing the process of annotating the data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, desigining and training machine learning models for different NLP tasks (named entity recognition, topic classification, clustering, sentiment analysis etc.). The primary tools I used were pandas, spacy, scikit-learn, keras and pytorch.
I would like to continue working in data science, especially (but not necessarily) if the work will contain elements from NLP and deep learning.
I am an open-minded person willing to try and learn new things, so I don't have particularly strong expectations towards the company. I believe that any type of company can be a good fit for me, if there are some interesting tasks and some professional people on the project."

From September to November 2021 worked at Ukrainian company. The goal of the project was automation and optimization of the placement solar system. On the project I worked mostly with AWS: created a lambda function for downloading data and uploading it to S3 bucket. Also, I moved the app to EC2. 

September 2020 - September 2021. Worked in a small Ukrainian company, where I had different projects.
1. Created a welcoming message based on LinkedIn page. For automation data collection I used Flask and Selenium. There was my first meeting with NLP - I used NLTK, Language tool, and tested language models (GPT-2, T5, Bert). The final program contained GPT-2, which was trained on sets of welcoming messages.
2. Object detection. Wrote image classificator for finding broken parts on solar panels. Used OpenCV for image preprocessing (crop the extra parts of photos, cut them into equal parts.
3. Found dependence between age, sex, results of blood tests and diagnosis. We hadn`t enough data and couldn't create it in the office :) So, this project was interesting but not successful.

From 2019 to 2020 I worked as a coding mentor for children. My tasks were to create a study program and teach children Python.

"
data scientist,"From the age of 14, I have become accustomed to independently solve any scientific problems at various contests and competitions, and then reasonably defend my thoughts on appeal and among my teammates and supervisors. This experience made me at the same time both really good team player and independently thinking person who doesn't avoid responsibilities for decisions and solutions that can best fix the situation.

As a University student was honored by few Excellence scholarships including Excellence scholarship of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

I have wide range of interests from data analysis, statistics and programming to quantum physics and biomechanics, and get use to grasp new concepts and assignments quickly without needing hand-holding.

Breaking into blocks my previous experience, I can highlight the following:

  As a data scientists / system analyst I had an unforgettable experience with analyzing customer requirements with respect to current solution and identifying gaps and opportunities for improvement of existing solutions. Close and productive collaboration with management, quality assurance, architecture and other development teams, participation in code reviews taught me stern lessons and instilled unshakable restraint. So unshakable that now I can say with confidence that I can literally communicate with everyone in any conditions and come to constructive solutions that will benefit everyone.

  In close collaboration with Marketing and Product Departments I had to learn how to process the scattered data from different sources (inner DB,GA,Y.M,CRM,etc) and calculate the core metrics such as CPA, CPC, SAS, CR, Churn Rate, ROMI, LTV through BigQuery (using Python to program queries and functions manually). Next to this experience, Tableau, Power BI, OWOX BI and similar systems for processing and visualizing data seem really simple. =) Plz, if somebody from those companies is reading this a la CV, don't get offended!

  In conclusion to my adventures as a data scientists, I can point out that I also have a modest experience in Business Analysis and Email Marketing, including development of a business strategy based on the given data and researching users' behavior in order to impact on their perception through the emails and/or through other ways of digital communication with a consumer.

I'm not interested in building tinder for X or facebook for Y.

With my experience and passions I would like to contribute to qualitative R&D as well as to building cohesive result-oriented teams with culture for curiosity and good communication. 

Disclaimer: I am involved in another project and I am not able to join full-time (at least for now)."
data scientist,"I started to code at 21 years old as a complete beginner with a single goal in mind, to program and launch a social network. The website was successful and attracted around 300 people. Three years after that, I assumed a senior position as a frontend developer. In the following years, I mentored and even tutored a dozen people in programming. About one-third of them have found jobs in software development.

At 24 years old, after an unexpected occurrence of playing a Fallout game in English despite knowing none of it, I realized that learning a language might have been easier than I had previously thought. I have started reading books in English voraciously since then, and now I do all my notes and drafts in English.

I started doing math at 27 years old (only 4 years ago). In the first year of studying, I did more than 1600 school-level math problems. Then I completed several advanced math, CS, and ML courses. I’ve been working in ML for two years now.
I've been programming for 10+ years, mostly in Python and TypeScript. I’m pretty knowledgeable about IT in general and have developed deep expertise in several areas. In the last 5 years I have worked with several teams building complex applications. I swiftly absorb new knowledge and often practice maths. Overall I have more than 8 years of experience in software development and 2 years in financial machine learning.

In my current position, I have set up a complex architecture for data collection from crypto exchanges and designed an ML pipeline from the ground up. I've worked with time series and employed exotic metrics (i.e. concordance index). I have compiled a survey of the methods used in financial data analysis.

In my previous job, I predicted stock market fluctuations from public data (news, SEC filings) using classical ML algorithms and Transformer models. I worked with all parts of the process, from collecting data to deploying models.

Before that, when I worked for Waves platform, I was a front-end team lead working on the client application for the Waves blockchain. I designed the architecture and performed security analysis, created a library to work with cryptography and the blockchain API. I also gave lectures about blockchain, including a talk at HighLoad++ in 2017.

Full details of my work experiences are listed on LinkedIn.
I want two things from my future job: 1) contribution to the well-being of society and 2) more structural complexity, in the sense of having a lower noise-to-signal ratio in the data (in finance, the signal is very low and the structure of the data is practically flat — everything revolves around reducing noise and getting what crumbs are left of the signal).

The perfect job for me is 70% deep learning research and 30% spent on its implementation. Despite my lack of experience, I know how to learn quickly and can generate lots of ideas that I can also implement and test.

I certainly do not want to work in entertainment (selfie-improving apps, funny chatbots, etc). I'd rather not work with structure-poor CSV data if that's the only kind of data to work with."

I've been programming for 8 years now, mostly in JavaScript and Python. In the last 4 years I participated in the development of several complex applications.

During the last year I completed several machine learning and math courses. I also took part in several competitions, the last one was Yandex Championship.

At my last job I led the development of the client application for the Waves blockchain platform. Designed the architecture, and performed security analysis. Created a library to work with cryptography and the blockchain API. I also gave lectures about blockchain, including the talk at HighLoad++ 2017.

I swiftly grasp new knowledge, and I am actively studying mathematics.
I want to start working with NLP or CV (both areas hold my attention as of now) in a team with a good mentoring attitude. I can offer not only to complete my own tasks but also to help others and propose insights on the current problems.

Although I'm okay with writing some production code, I would prefer to dive deep into research (that is, it would be nice to have a 20/80 or a 30/70 balance between the two).

While I also can prototype a frontend app, I would love not to.

During my last hackathon together with the team, we took prize place, and later the ministry of justice of Ukraine suggested us to work together on the new project. We developed the service for independent anonymous legal polls, that balanced the audience. I engaged in statistics, processed data and made survey reports. After that, with this project we participated in innovation justice challenge 1991, it was like the business incubator. There we improved our skills and got knowledge about the foundation of business startups, and also took prize place.
I want to find something that is connected to data preparation and models training. I am a faculty of CS graduate, and during my study, I also was learning Machine Learning algorithms and methods. I made different pet projects to learn some concepts and wrote machine learning thesis. I researched dependency of some  symptoms and chronic diseases of COVID-19 patients on their disease outcome, who were ill on COVID-19. During my research, I was dealing with medical data, that I was preprocessing, made one-hot encoding and normalization, then trained models for binary classification  (KNN, logistic regression, decision tree classifier, SVM and Naive Bayes) and used metrics, like f-score, log loss and ROC to evaluate the model.
One of the main points in my future work that is weighty for me is that I want to make progress in my developing. So I want to find the project that would be hard enough for me, maybe some technology that I didn’t use in my experience, so I could learn from it and develop my skills.

data scientist,"I have developed a model capable of finding decay events using the transfer learning approach.

It is noteworthy that the weights that I used for prediction were obtained by training the model on data from a completely different area than the one in which I made predictions.
I was a member of the ALPhA team (Davidson, USA). My work was to develop an unsupervised model that would allow detection of decay events in an AT-TPC detector. The bottom line was to pull our data through the PointNet model (which was trained on completely different data from ours) and extract the latent space from there, which was later used as input data in OneClassSVM.

Recently Completed Projects:
1. Armenian-based bank - The project was about a loan default prediction in the bank. This project's goal was to build a machine learning model that can predict if a person will default on the loan based on it and the personal information provided. The model was intended to be used as a tool for making decisions on issuing loans so that the risk can be lowered and the profit can be maximized. There were different functionalities from data gathering from different sources to training various models. Finally, a Gradient Boosting model was built to predict loans' probability of default. The working process involved a lot of communication with business owners, retail banking colleagues, planning, and development.

data scientist,"-Recommendation system, increased click-through rate by > 20%. All the conventional approaches, including collaborative filtering, item-based and hybrid algorithms, were failing in the case of C2C marketplace, where the lifetime of ads is very short. It was impossible to collect statistically significant data about a particular ad or user, so we moved from user-ad interaction granularity to user cluster - ad cluster. I was responsible for the clusterization of users, which was done based on their interactions as clicks, views and contacts with different categories of good. I tried several unsupervised learning algorithms, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation turned out to be the best in terms of business interpretability. This clusterization showed us some interesting segments of users including 'people who just moved to a new place' (were buying different types of furniture, carpets and some housing furniture) or segment of 'students' (looked for language courses, books, visa services).

- Predicting the speed of sales of products and optimizing it by providing a seller with recommendations for an ad design. XGBoost for predicting hours till the sale; using prices, features from the product description and product picture as variables. Afterwards, we used Shap and Lime explainer to provide the seller with factors that slow down the sale process. The model for sell-time prediction is also used as a proxy for ad quality to sort ads in the recommendation block. The accuracy of a model is nearly 80%, and it is already used in production.

- Survival model for churn prediction with 70% accuracy. The model is build to detect those with a high risk of churn, find the early predictors of churn and act to save customers. Still in the experimental phase.

- Find duplicate products based on the photo for the online marketplace. We implemented an algorithm stacking two-level clusterization and Similarity Network (deep learning), and increased the grouping level by ~30%.

The second project is part of the Data Science for Social Good program; I worked as a data scientist at this one. I worked in an international team, in cooperation with UK non-profit organisation St Basils, which provides services to assist homeless youth. The internship took place at Warwick University in the UK. I performed exploratory data analysis on large datasets, developed predictive models, and created a dashboard for the organisation to conveniently use and interpret these models' predictions.

I have successfully developed several solo and team projects in the university too. Those included database processing, implementing effective algorithms on different data structures, creating models in Python and applying distinct APIs to improve the experience of the user of the program (e.g. Microsoft Azure API, Trello API). I also implemented a project on Neural Networks and Deep Learning from the course on the Coursera platform, and was an active attendee of Lviv Data Science summer school 2021.

data scientist,"- The week I joined a project that has been going on for half a year, I suggested a different approach, and it raised the R2 score from about 0.01 to 0.5 on real-world economic data.
- In a behavior prediction project helped the client to change perspective on the task, metrics and results' evaluation, which led to more insights on the dats and subsequent precision increase (10-20% for the same recall for a late-term project), and more importantly to a change of their perception of our team's success and to years of subsequent collaboration with this client.
- Implemented from scratch several cutting-egde meta-models only with basic libraries for different projetcs, and in non-poc projects they were succesfully industrialized (using only basic libraries was a client's request, I'm not that arrogant)
I have worked in a client-facing role on different projects on:
• Time series forecasting with various underlying models (neural networks, Markov and Bayesian models, standard tools like gradient boosting, linear regression etc).
• Causal inference: establishing an effect of a particular factor (way of contact a client, prices of products) on a desired outcome. In all the projects I identified and implemented the most appropriate models from research papers into shipping products.
• Reinforcement learning: drone flying in a simulation and (a personal project) optimal quantum control.
• I also participated in a non-ML international interdisciplinary research project on quantum-assisted computation. I developed architecture and a compiler for a quantum co-processor and evaluated potential computational benefits of the device.

From 8/2022 to 6/2023:
Conducted in-depth research on the statistical and algebraic properties of the distribution of primitive roots in sets of consecutive primes.
Collected and analyzed extensive data sets related to prime numbers, including calculating primitive roots and examining their distribution patterns.
Assisted in the preparation and revision of research papers, including detailed analysis, interpretation of results, and discussion of theoretical implications.
Utilized statistical analysis techniques to evaluate the observed patterns and assess the validity of Artin's Conjecture.
Utilized capabilities of Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Numba for efficient calculations which led to interesting results.

Currently, I am involved in an ambitious project that focused on emotion classification based on EEG data. This project aims to harness the power of EEG technology to develop innovative methods for accurately classifying emotions, paving the way for new insights in cognitive science and human-computer interaction.

We proposed a methodology for classifying EEG signals based on signal processing using wavelet transform and superlet transform. The wavelet transform is used to decompose the EEG signal into frequency components, which are then used as features for classification. The proposed approach is evaluated using the publicly available “GAMEEMO” EEG dataset, which has been annotated by valence and emotional arousal.

data scientist,"MLOps pipeline. The MLOps pipeline is a framework for ml engineers to be able to integrate any models or tools into pipeline, simple words to give it to artists hands. VFX companies don’t really use ML, artists do everything manually. So I created the project with full ci/cd stack like testing, building, deploying, transfer into air-gapped production environment, etc. And most important, that models can be integrated even by data scientists, without any engineering experience. Tools require engineers because it’s more complicated of course.
With over 5 years of experience as an ML Engineer, I have a proven track record of managing cross-functional teams and generating significant revenue, as evidenced by recent projects that have generated approximately $25 million. My career is marked by persistent innovation, involving the discovery and integration of cutting-edge tools and solutions to enhance both existing and new systems.

data scientist,"1) Doing pre-sales prototypes fast during my experience in Perfectial. Sometimes I had only 2 days to do a prototype of a complicated AI project
Industry experience:

1) Internship at R&D department at Abto Software(Aug 2019-Sep 2019)

2) Intern/Junior Data Scientist at Perfectial (Oct 2019-Mar 2020)

Personal projects:

1)  Skin Cancer Lesions classification

In this project classification of skin lesions with 7 different diagnoses was performed using CNN. Also image feature extraction using Radiomics library was performed. 

2) Flappy Bird game bot

In this project we've written a Python library for NEAT(Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) and also used another Python library for generating a NEAT model for passing Flappy Bird tubes. We've obtained the best result at about 100 tubes passed.

3) Icons generation using Deep Learning

My solution was to train 3 types of models: Variational Autoencoder, Vanilla GAN and DCGAN and compare their results. Using manual evaluation, we can say that results from a Vanilla GAN were not usable, because they lacked sharpness and picked only some very basic patterns. In case of Variational Autoencoder, results were much more icon-like, but too messy. But result of DCGAN is the best of three methods used, because it picked more complicated patterns.

4) Time series analysis and prediction of production in Malaysia

Time series analysis and prediction of production in Malaysia In this project, I tried to predict agricultural production of some products in Malaysia by historical data. The yearly forecast was obtained using several ways: using AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA models, using classical ML methods like Lasso Regression, but also using Deep Learning technologies like 1d CNN and LSTM.

5) Link between Simpsons sentiment and sentiment in mass media in USA(1990-2017)

In this project, I analyzed sentiment in USA society and compared it with the sentiment in The Simpsons TV show for further insights. The biggest part of the project consisted of data imputation, data gathering, and merging. The main insight was inconclusive. Also, I was trying to find patterns.
I really don't know, I'm open to any new possibilities. But I like new technologies and something experimental."

data scientist,"
I’ve completed various projects (mostly in data analysis and ML, with a few older ones in embedded systems). 

My most recent creation is an optical character recognition Kaggle notebook that uses a CNN with a spatial pyramid pooling layer for classification of handwritten symbols. It’s mainly built on PyTorch. 

During an earlier work experience with Jellyfish in London, England, I was given time series data from a real business to analyse. The result is a Jupyter notebook that helps measure the impact of creative optimisations on relevant key ASO performance metrics: it produces a report that compares mean and median conversion rates two weeks prior to the optimisation to those two weeks after. The project heavily utilises pandas and also features basic Matplotlib visualisations.

A fun thing to mention from a while ago is my participation in the Robotex International line following competition in Tallinn.

Previous work experience

IBM Integration Developer
• Developed and supported IBM Message Broker services.
• Worked with cross-functional teams to analyze existing system implementations and designed new functionality solutions sat-
isfying business needs.
• Deployed the improvements on the test environment.
• Quickly found solutions to eliminate problems in a production environment.

It has always been my ambition to become a specialist in data analysis and find useful insights to improve the efficiency of the given products. 
While studying for my BSc in Computer Science at university, I developed a strong interest in using Machine Learning algorithms and Neural Networks to predict the behavior of various processes based on the available data. After working over 2 years as a IBM Integration Developer, I have a deep understanding of software development life cycle, CI/CD processes and Scrum methodology. However, this experience also highlighted my desire to use data for analysis and making meaningful predictions rather than merely maintaining infrastructure for its transfer.

"
data scientist,"Original project:
My goal was to create model that can predict count of likes based on text and amount of followers. I have used Twitter API to take data about users and tweets( like the amount of followers, text of a tweet, count of likes, etc). Then I have preprocessed data with pandas and numpy. My next step was to create new csv with less data, because my laptop was not powerful enough. So, then I just preprocessed data (vectorized text and added to this vector count of followers). The last step was to make the model. I found the best model - it's Logistic Regression, which gives for me an 89% accuracy.
And I've taken part in the competitions on the Kaggle.
Python Developer / Data Scientist (October 2022 - August 2023).
Implement time series forecasting techniques for solar
prediction.
XGBoost(with trees) have been chosen as model for this
project, because first of all in this dataset we had almost no correlation between X and Y, so Linear Regression will not fit, resources was limited so LSTM was no use for this project. And among all tree models, XGBoost gives the best results. It gives best results due to many reasons, for example: regularization built in this model, it is ensemble method, it has good tuning due to parametrize.

Within the project I researched different techniques of continual learning and applied them to the specific problem in order to estimate their efficiency. 
Second, I passed Deep Learning and Tensorflow specializations on Coursera learning platform.
Third, I successfully worked on an internship ""Advanced C++ and low-level software development"".
I see my development in the sphere of Artificial intelligence, more specifically machine learning. To this end I took a Master's program in Computer Science at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.
My preferences concerning my future occupation are the following: I want my job to require creativity rather than purely technical abilities, and I want to apply deep learning in my work. At present though my foremost goal is to obtain experience, after which I may tweak my wishes."

I have extensive work experience as an AI Engineer with a fast-paced startup team. In this role, I designed and developed several natural language processing projects including named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. I also created predictive models and was responsible for some MLOps activities. Additionally, I have some experience with front-end development.

Prior to my work as an AI Engineer, I worked as a Robotics and Programming Teacher. In this role, I developed excellent communication and explanation skills, which helped me to effectively teach complex concepts to students.
Challenging tasks, new experience"
data scientist,"During study practice I had to write a script that converts csv file into pandas data frame, clears the DF and save data in DB. First of all I had to look at data in csv file in order to decide which technique use to create a DF. The DF was created, after that it had to be cleaned. There were a lot of cells with missed values. All rows with missed values had to be deleted except if cell is not in admissible column. There weren’t any ""dangerous"" NA values, so I could continue. But one column had wrong format of data, so I had to delete rows with wrong format. One column had urls and not all of them were responding. So I had to delete rows with the urls weren’t responding. And finally the DF was clean. Every URL is a way to download file, I had to download all of them, extract HTML content from them and save HMTL in MySQL db. 
I you want to see code I could show it at the meeting or we can have a calling. For writing script I used Python and libraries such as numpy, pandas, requests, bs4, pathlib, os, shutil, aspose-words, re, mysql and json.
I have no commercial experience. I have only experience in my university, include study practice. I also had certificates from DL.ai. During studying in university I had study projects: Paint in PyQt, Library App in PyQt and an experiment to show how regular expressions make life easier for programmers in C/C++.

I've made a part of a research project in the Computer Science and System Engineering Department (U2IS) in ENSTA Paris. 
My task was to develop deep learning models to directly predict vessel movements from images of the sea surface. In this work, in order to predict ship motion from images, nine deep neural network models were created and tested. Such variety of models is caused by the complexity of the problem. Empirical results show that models with LSTM parts and using additional information such as the current ship motion improve the pitch and roll prediction accuracy. The best result was achieved by a [CNN LSTM encoder-decoder images PR] model. The best combination of parameters was found using the Hyperband algorithm.

data scientist,"
Over the past 8 years, I have been involved in several research and development projects requiring NLP solutions. From 2015 to 2017, I worked as a research assistant at the ISP RAS Institute (I created a Russian part-of-speech tagger and contributed it to the NLTK library). In 2017, after completing my Software Engineering bachelor's degree. I worked as the lead of a newly established NLP laboratory by ISP RAS. At the laboratory, our work focused on problems of text classification, morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis, using word embeddings (e.g. fastText), language models (such as BERT, GPT) and their task-specific fine-tuning. These results have been published in international computer science journals and conferences.
One significant achievement of our team was the development of software tools for plagiarism detection in Armenian texts. These later became the foundation of my PhD thesis, which I defended in 2021 , and the resulting software system is now deployed in several higher education organizations in Armenia. Since 2022, we extended this research to also assess other aspects of text quality (structure, semantic coherence,etc.) apart from originality, and the results are currently used in RANEPA academy. The implementation of these projects required a wide range of NLP and ML technologies (from rule-based methods and smaller statistical approaches to LLMs, model fine-tuning, quantization, etc.).
In the meantime, I also supervised relatively smaller projects such as the collaboration with the INALCO institute’s DALiH project to collect from the web and classify Armenian
texts in various dialects; the addition of NER support for Armenian language to Stanford’s stanza library; collaboration with the National Library of Armenia to OCR their catalog of books and articles, etc. All of these projects helped gain specific knowledge and expertise in various text processing areas, including also data collection and preprocessing, annotation guidelines development, annotation automation and quality verification.
As the team supervisor, I mentored and facilitated the professional growth of
newcomers, overseeing the recruitment and development of the team from 5 members in 2018 to 15 members in 2023. Guiding the professional growth of my colleagues has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.

I have worked on several data science and machine learning projects, but the one that stands out for me the most is working on a project called ""Financial Fraud Statement Detection"". 

In this project, my team was given a dataset containing financial statements from companies spanning across different industries like construction, logistics etc. and we were tasked to use features like EBITA, Revenue, Default Status etc. to find patterns between similar statements in the dataset. Since there was no ground truth given in the dataset (no labels) as to whether a financial statement was fraudulent or not, We applied an ensemble of 3 unsupervised machine learning techniques, these techniques include; Isolation forest model, Auto-Encoders and Ratio Analysis, After obtaining classifications from each of the models, an ensemble model was formed in the following pattern:

1. If all the models indicates a statement is not fraudulent, we classify that as “Not Fraudulent” with a Fraud Probability of 0

2. If 1 out of the 3 models indicates a statement is fraudulent, we classify that as “Unlikely Fraudulent” with a Fraud Probability of 1/3 or 0.33

3. If 2 out of the 3 models indicates a statement is fraudulent, we classify that as “Likely Fraudulent” with a Fraud Probability of 2/3 or 0.67

4. If all 3 models indicates a statement is fraudulent, we classify that as “Fraudulent” with a Fraud Probability of 3/3 or 1.

After this model was developed, we launched the solution in form of a streamlit application and deployed on AWS EC2, where a user an upload their financial statement and get the classification in real time.

data scientist,"
I'm a data scientist with more than three years of professional experience. 

I started as a machine learning researcher at a deep tech startup, mainly doing research and contributing to the core tech. Our primary focus was sequence-to-sequence modeling for speech generation.

Since then, I've transitioned to a traditional data science role working for an online classified/marketplace with a ""release early, release fast"" approach to development, high product experimentation culture, and great emphasis on user feedback. There I was involved in building an ecosystem of computer vision microservices (e.g., classification, similarity search, quality assessment) for automatic advertisement posting & development of a recommender engine. For the last year, I was a product owner of the whole data science ecosystem, managing a small team & constantly reporting to the C-level. 

Those positions allowed me to gain necessary skills to build a complete data science solution carrying it through all stages, from research and development to deployment and quality assessment. 

The primary area of my expertise lies in recommender systems, computer vision, generative modeling & classic data science (clustering, classification, etc.)

Currently, I'm looking for a new project to apply all my skills and make an impact.
An ideal option is a mix of research/modeling and development/deployment. I have some experience in a productionization & deployment of my models, and I view it as a common part of data science solution development. However, I'm not seeking any pure data engineering position.

I'm open to both full-time and part-time options. Remote positions are more preferable."

I started to get interested in data science and machine learning 1.5 years ago. For now I have graduated from a number of courses (f.e. “Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing and Machine Learning” course from MIT) and participated in a 4 month internship from Ukrainian IT-company “SOLVVE”.  There I gained experience solving a computer vision problem, using Python with OpenCV, Keras, NumPy libraries and the convolutional neural network called U-net.
I would like to solve classic ML tasks (regression, classification, etc.) and computer vision problems where I can apply my knowledge in linear algebra."
