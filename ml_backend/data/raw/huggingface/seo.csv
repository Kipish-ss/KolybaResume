Performed tech SEO audits, led link-building campaigns and made competitor researches, also helped head of department in teaching newcomers, performed a webinar and even had a couple of expert articles published from the name of the company.
- Next stop - one of the worlds' leading e-commerce sites (website themes). As an SEO analyst, beside things i've performed in my previous position, i elaborated grey-hat bulk link-building techniques, performed SEO experiments, tried outreach and PBNs on my own. (1 year)
- 3rd place - world's top educational startup. My position was an SEO generalist, but the majority of my tasks were about growth hacking. There i've got more knowledge in creating PBNs, generating textual content, scaled blog from 1 to 7 language versions, dived deeper in tech SEO. Created a department of 13 people (9 foreign native speakers, Python dev and 2 team leads) which were interviewed, hired, trained and managed by me. The department was responsible for linkbuilding and managed to get ~$30K on a monthly basis at almost 0 cost. I've developed and automized all infrastructure for tasks the department was responsible for (link-building, email delivery and open rates, and CRO). (2.5 year)
- Next workplace was a tourism marketplace, where i've mostly performed website content experiments and managed link-builders. Despite the fact that the project suffered from first medical update (August 2018), it successfully recovered after implementation of my recommendations. (1 year)
- Next stop - a UK marketplace. Optimized the project from the very base level which tripled visibility after a year and doubled the year after (50% YoY traffic growth). Been heavily involved in product and business sides, learned SQL, learned to run Facebook and Google ads. (3 years)
- Worked for a US app product company as an acquisition lead + manage a network of sites and a web development team + optimize paid search campaigns ($100K+/mo) + develop and lead web product
- Currently working for a DE travel startup as a Senior SEO manager for Tier 1 markets (US+UK+rest of en-countries)

+ Worked with several known Ukrainian companies as side projects (penalties removal, audits, statups launch, content strategy, tools development).
I'm looking for a company where i'd be able to develop myself to the next level. I believe this could be a position of a Head of acquisition, digital lead/head or similar, where there is possibility to work with the product on various levels and where many traffic channels are involved."

www.rochdalelocksmiths.com/

In this project, I’ve done keyword research, and created additional pages on its basis. The structure needed to be improved so some changes in it were done too. I ordered unique articles from copywriters freelancers and inserted them to the website with the content manager. Local listings (google business profile, yelp and others) were also involved. 
The website itself was developed not on CRM, so technical tasks for the developer (in-house) were also created. Competitor analysis, keyword research and rankings checkup were done manually analyzing local SERP and then by using MOZ. 

Within 2 months we have done rebranding, changed business name and edited all content accordingly. Google Business Profile is being updated regularly, I replied to reviews and made posts there on the basis of our keywords! Editing listings for brand change is still in the progress. 

We have managed to gain more targeted traffic from restructuring, and editing content by adding long-tail keywords!

To gain a deeper understanding and explore the principles and workings of affiliate marketing, I have created my own test project targeted towards the USA. To realize this project, I had to complete three thematic courses and master tools such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics, LinkedIn, website builders, copywriting, and SEO.

What I can do:
Process large volumes of data and analyze market trends.
Write engaging articles highly relevant to Google.
Develop promotion and advertising strategies.
Independently handle significant workloads.
Learn quickly.

In the last month and a half, I have completed several courses in affiliate marketing, including:

""Internet Marketing"" from Academy Step
""The Ultimate Affiliate Marketing Course For Beginners 2023"" by Joshua George
""Starting a career in affiliate marketing"" by Major Affiliate Marketing Academy.
These are just some of the courses I have taken, and I continue to learn in this field.

Experience:
More than 7 years of experience as a Project Manager
Worked in Info Business (ML Group) as a PM, responsible for analysis, selection of effective PR and monetization tools, and utilizing digital tools for product and brand promotion
Worked in Innovative Technologies (Magic Innovations) as a PM, Account Manager, and Sales, responsible for working with existing and new customers

A long chain of bureaucracy: The process of decision-making in some organizations can be long and complicated. In an ideal scenario, if someone has a question or a proposal for improvement, it can be resolved or implemented immediately without going through multiple layers of approval.

Doing something socially useless: Many people want to feel like they are making a difference or contributing to society in some way. Jobs that don't provide this sense of purpose can be demotivating.

Being tied to the office or the time frame of the working day: People value flexibility and autonomy in their work. Having to be in the office at specific times or adhering to strict schedules can be a barrier to achieving a good work-life balance.

Restrictions in professional, financial, and career growth: People want to feel like they are progressing in their careers and that they have opportunities for growth and development. Limitations in any of these areas can be frustrating and demotivating.

Overall, it is important for individuals to consider their own personal values and priorities when evaluating a job or career path. It is also important for employers to be aware of these factors and strive to create work environments that are supportive, flexible, and provide opportunities for growth and development."

seo,"
My work experience in the field of marketing began in September 2020, after obtaining specialized education in marketing from the National University of Food Technologies in Kyiv. Intrigued by the SEO industry, I joined an outsourcing company as a crowd marketer.

During this period, I gained extensive experience in managing marketing projects. My responsibilities included developing and implementing digital marketing strategies, increasing brand awareness, attracting target audiences, and enhancing conversion rates.

In June 2021, I transitioned to The Whykingz company, where I currently hold the position of a link builder. In this role, I am responsible for developing and executing strategies for acquiring quality links (link building) to improve the company's website ranking in search engines. My tasks also involve market analysis, identifying potential partners, building mutually beneficial collaborations, and monitoring results.

Through my work at The Whykingz, I have been able to develop my skills in the field of link building and improve my understanding of effective search engine optimization strategies. I have experience working with various tools and techniques, such as keyword analysis, link building, website auditing, and performance metrics tracking.

My experience at The Whykingz demonstrates my ability to adapt to new roles and quickly acquire new skills. I work with great enthusiasm and self-discipline, always striving for high achievements and continuous professional growth.

Outreach Specialist (3 years)
I started my career as an outreach specialist and worked with multiple niches, locations, and languages (the main ones were EN, FR, DE, and ES). During this time I've mastered different SEO tools like Ahrefs, Similarweb, Scrapebox, etc. I've grown to Senior Outreach Specialist in two years and then managed a small team of remote outreach specialists.

SEO Manager (3,5 years)
After the previous experience, I decided to change the company and role and started to work as Junior SEO Manager. I have experience working in different SaaS niches and achieved top positions in multiple markets with different projects, outranking the competitors like the most authoritative review websites.
I've grown to Senior SEO Manager in 2,5 years. I believe that among the most interesting tasks that I have experience with are the following: 
- different experiments regarding conversion rate optimization - using Google Optimize at the beginning, then switching to hotjar and simple A/B tests without dedicated tools
- successful website redesigns without losing the top positions
- applying multiple linkbuilding strategies
- weekly cooperation with the linkbuilding, design, content, and development teams to maintain the projects at the proper level

I like the product approach for each website I work with the most. I appreciate the possibility of working with a team of experienced and motivated professionals  to achieve the common goal.

Given that vast majority of my projects were from scratch I always had an impact on both technical and business sides of the project. First of all it was always important for to see whole picture, so I can prepare technical base that would support all business requirements, future ideas and possible vector changes. 

So basically I have learnt that as much as I enjoy development of clear, refined, yet complex solutions I lean to prefer designing ideas, collaboration, research, organizing processes, hiring and generally looking for the ways to positively impact business and development.
I'm looking for a position where I would be able to effectively contribute and positively impact projects using my skills, expertise and knowledge developed over many years of creating software solutions."

I am currently studying at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (2nd year of bachelor of applied mathematics).

I started my career in 2018 when I joined the Jetocotpus crawler team as a Content Strategist. That
was a great opportunity to immerse myself in the nuances of technical SEO because I created
articles, guides, and case studies with best practices of log file analysis, crawler audits, on-page
optimization, etc.

After that time, I decided to move forward to gain practical experience. I was hired as a junior SEO
specialist by Idea Digital Agency in 2020. I had a hunger for knowledge and experience and also
initiated changes to improve the workflow. My efforts were rewarded: in 2021, I was promoted to the
Team Leader position. In that year, the number of employees in my team and clients increased 1.5
times. In December 2021, I got a raise to Head of the SEO department.

Unfortunately, the Russian invasion of my Homeland Ukraine has made adjustments to Idea Digital
Agency's business roadmap: we lost all clients from the Ukrainian market, and I was forced to reduce
half of the employees to stay afloat. Nevertheless, I did my best and helped the Sales team to change
the strategy and find new clients for American and European countries.

In June 2022, I made the decision to seize the opportunity to switch to an in-house technical SEO
position in the iGaming industry because I wanted to delve deeper into the challenges of SEO in a
highly competitive niche. 

Currently, I also balance my main job with a part-time SEO consultant positions to maintain focus on on-page and off-page SEO niches.

After writing hundreds of high-quality SEO-optimized content over the last 7 years for different brands, I have come to get a deep understanding of the psychology of “content customers.”

To get POSITIVE RESPONSES or ENGAGEMENT from your audience, you need to;

Understand their fears, hesitations, dreams, and why they would want to or not do something...

Connect with them and create a level of trust...

You need to make your content conversational and easy to read…

Provide solutions to their problems…

There are several more tips for writing excellent SEO Business Content, ranking your website high on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), and boosting your revenue.

I will use my experience over my 5+ years of writing professionally to write attention-grabbing content that will rank high on Google and get you the desired results.

I guess you can understand what a positive impact this will have on your brand.

Imagine how your business will benefit from doubling your audience or sales using the most effective writing techniques. Does that make you smile?

Experts in SEO with more than 7 years of experience in this field. SEO projects are my favorite, and I’m sure we can handle your ones. I did a lot of work for local and international businesses in the US, Canada. I also have a good understanding of how business works in Europe and Australia. As for the niches - there were eComm, Finance, Lead projects, health&beauty studios, including the promotion of dentists, etc. The digital segment is also part of the whole thing - applications, SaaS, and others. 

There are two kinds of SEO specs - the first is those who keep writing texts and performing template tasks, and the second is those who start digging, analyzing, growth hacking, looking for problems, testing hypotheses, and looking for solutions to non-trivial problems.
Once upon a time, I tested a hypothesis in which we determined the critical rate of spam, by artificial increasing and decreasing the amount of spam on the site with the application, thereby revealing the root of the problem.

Hi, 
I’m an outreach specialist building links in white-hat industries.

I believe helpful websites should be on top of search results and get as much organic traffic as possible. Link building is one of the methods to achieve this goal.

My broad background in research and teaching areas helps me run overall analyses on how to improve the site's visibility in Google searches.

For better SERPs of a website, I can :

- use SEO tools (Ahrefs, Snov, Pitchbox) to study competitors' profiles, find prospects with potential leads, make personalized emails, and automate outreach campaigns;

- make up a list of catchy topics for guest posting in any white-hat niche;

- make the right technical task for copywriters;

- land around 5-10 free links (insertion/guest posting) per month for one project (depending on a niche);

- negotiate prices with webmasters for paid posts (depending on your budget);

- make up a list of anchors and place links for one project (up to 50-100 links per month) on relevant crowd platforms for better Off-page SEO. Moreover, I can delegate this task and check it out;

- do internal linking and work with keywords for better On-page SEO;

- use Google Sheets to run link-building processes;

- use Ahrefs to test all possible ways of link building;

- Ahrefs, Serpstat, Semrush, Keycollector
- Google Search Console, Google Analytics
- WordPress, OpenCart (as SEO I can change some basic stuff, add links or edit the formatting but still will need the help of developers in more complicated tasks)

I have experience and skills to develop the online presence that your business NEEDS.
"

SEO is what I’ve been doing since 2007. All this time I’ve been inside the evolution process, which made Search Engine Optimization the one we know it today. I’ve seen Panda and Penguin filters, fought against overoptimization and manipulative link strategies, resolving sites from Google penalties. 

My first company sold cheap car dash kits and had 20 sales a day. 5 years later it became a huge monster with million+ pages in index, thousands of products and income of $ 3 millions a month. Surely that happened not because of just me, but because of dedicated treatment to SEO and Internet Marketing. My another client is on top 3 for phone cases query with over 900K followers on instagram. 1.5 years ago it hadn’t organic traffic at all. I have poor examples as well but this just underlines results of businesses which treats SEO differently.

I like analytics and researches. So when a new project arrives, I can estimate the amount of efforts required for good result achievement. I also perform technical site audits, keyword research, on-page optimization, internal linking, and creating and executing off-page optimization strategies.

My name is Giorgi, I've been working in the SEO industry for more than 3 years now. I've worked with 2 SEO companies so far, one a medium-sized affiliate marketing agency, creating dozens of different websites and providing SEO services to large clients in personal finance, iGaming, and investment firms. And the other is a White-label SEO agency where I'm currently employed.

I've headed 40 different projects requiring a full content plan of 500,000 words to be delivered within a month (20 working days) and have succeeded at all of them with a team of 5 writers, while also contributing to writing myself.

The content plan, keyword research, competitor analysis, and naturally, the briefs of these articles (article skeleton, keyword insertion, interlinking system) were all done by me and me alone.

Below you can find websites I've headed content and SEO campaigns for:

https://brewlogy.com/
https://cryptobetting.net/
https://bitcoincasinosreviews.com/
https://topesportsbettingsites.com/

All of the projects you see above were planned, executed, and analyzed with the help of tools such as

Most importantly, my writing style is engaging, and I can explain extremely complex terms to average users. I don't just write, I write technical content that would retain your audience's attention and stir them to share your website's content. 

 SEO Writing is my forte: Several articles I have written have ranked on Google's first page, and I know what is required to take a website from zero stars to five stars on search engines. I can also achieve this quickly, depending on the available resources.

I don't write projects after just a simple keyword research. I enjoy using premium software to research competitors. My favorite is Contentpace (previously Postpace). With Contentpace, I see what works for competitors and strategies to better them.

seo,"The first time I was supposed to get into SEO agency was through courses, but after an interview I was hired as a Junior SEO Specialist without taking a course.

In my second job I worked as a in-house SEO specialist for the first 4 months, after which I gathered and led a team of 4 people: SEO-Assistant, SMM-specialist, Content Manager, Web Developer. With the team we achieved a steady increase in organic traffic by 5-10% per month.

My last job was with two russian companies that I had to stop working with because of the attack on Ukraine. All my experience only in the CIS markets (UA, RU, KZ, BY, MD). My practical experience in foreign projects was the minimum. Now I have a great desire to re-train myself for foreign markets and join the great team of professionals, so I am ready to consider junior position with prospect of professional development and career growth.

If you have a proposition for me, I will be glad to consider it, send you a CV or talk to you.

I can do all SEO work.

Additional skills:
- HTML and CSS at a basic level. Can make up a simple page, mark up content, set styles, etc.
- can work with hosting panels and FTP site via FileZilla. I can manually update files, add pages, set up 301 redirects in htaccess, update SSL, etc.
- I can add or rework JS macros I need. I won't write from scratch, but I can edit and prepare the function I need from open source;
- XPath at a basic level for parsing the parameters I need via ScreamingFrog. Can pull prices, specifications, check for items on pages, etc.
- well acquainted with popular CMS from the inside: WordPress, Bitrix, Webasyst, OpenCart, etc.
- I can do pretty good photo and video editing in Photoshop and Movavi.

I understand the principles of other channels of attraction of traffic very well. Can work with such channels on an initial-pre-intermediate level:
- SERM: parsing, evaluation of the current situation, strategy development, setup and organization of the workflow;
- SMM: I can set up and run advertising campaigns in VK, FB/INST, TT;
