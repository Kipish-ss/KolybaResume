Serverless application

I've developed a serverless application using AWS services to streamline
scalability and maintenance. By leveraging API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and
DynamoDB, I've created a highly efficient backend structure that dynamically
adjusts to user demands. Hosting the frontend on Amazon S3 with CloudFront
ensures rapid content delivery, optimizing user experiences. Furthermore, I've

CRUD actions and secure user authentication using JWT and Passport. The 
frontend, built with React, integrates Formik and styled components for 
seamless task management. The app's responsive design adapts across devices, 
while React Query optimizes data handling.

During my studies, I have changed my interest Vector several times, so I am familiar with many areas and stacks of technologies. Unfortunately, it did not give me strong skills, but it taught me to quickly understand new things. Perhaps the most interesting experience was the software architecture labs, where we developed a build system, a balancer and an indexed database, and also wrote tests. Besides, I have always been attracted to algorithms and everything related to mathematics.
For now I am apprenticing as backend developer at Serverless Team but still open to job offers. You can review my progress on my github profile alongside with other works.
"
backend,"I like algorithmic challenges, to the point of taking part in the ICPC world semifinal.
During work hours, I write good C++ or Python code, dive into projects written in unfamiliar programming languages and manage not to drown, write automated testing systems, clean the nastiest parts of your backlog, develop algorithms using the freshness of my university knowledge, do data science-related menial labour such as finding inconsistencies in your databases and calculating statistics about your user base. 

On a lunch break, I typically ask why we use that fancy new technology instead of writing our own simple script, tell you the cool things we learn at university and omit the not-so-cool ones, tell jokes about high-dimensional space and explain if necessary, convince you to use AB-testing and introduce you to the concept of statistical significance. Love a good smalltalk about copy elision. 

I'm a fluent Java and JavaScript (ES5) reader, and can read almost any programming language with a dictionary. Sometimes I come up with a solution for quite a time, but when I do, I can tell the how and the why.
A caring team ready to answer a lot of questions :)
I'm definitely not doing this data science thing full-time again."

2. Implemented critical parts of a message pipeline handling 20 thousand messages per second with ease. Used Go, C++ and Scala, depending on requirements to services.
3. I teach operating systems at university just for fun. Not my main work.
I have been working with a team of 7 other developers for the past 3.5 years. I'm responsible for dozen of distributed services running 24/7 and I want to have similar experience. Highload is fine, but I'm not a performance zealot, more like simplicity and quality enthusiast. I would love to try something new (not listed in my skills), but neomania is not about me. I aim for boost of experience in AWS, k8s and similar stuff. I haven't tried it and I feel that I lag behind the industry.
I have a master's degree in CS.
I don't want to find a new job *right now*. The best option is to have an offer in June. If it's a remote work, I'm going to be ready in April.

I have had experience in several projects with both backend and frontend
development. In general, I am a backend developer, which means I have firm
experience with PHP and GO languages, but for the last two years I've used
almost only go language.  Additionally, I have some knowledge of the c/c++
languages, which I learned mostly for fun, but then I found it helpful during reading
clickhouse sources and helping my sisters with their university homeworks:) Almost
all my projects used relational (Mysql/Mariadb) databases as the main database
but for different parts were used another solutions like MongoDB or Clickhouse.
Regarding the front end, I've used VueJs, but have a little knowledge of ReactJs.
I also have experience with Gitlab CI/CD and in most part of my projects I used
Docker and kubernetes. I was implementing API using REST, JsonApi and JsonRPC
approaches. Familiar with grpc but didn't use it for production yet. Have experience
with processing large amounts of data and establishing communication between
services using queues in Redis, Kafka and RabbitMQ. In all projects, I have used
Linux, Nginx, git. In some projects had a bit of experience with Temporal.io and nats.

Regarding the other skills, I have experience in scrum, and once I've been a scrum
master for my team. Finally, I used to work on projects related to e-learning,
statistics, and web support of the game development.

Though I may not have commercial experience, I have been working on several pet-projects and team projects. The main goals of pet-projects were to grow up as individual developer(programming, problem-solving, information seeking, etc.) and learn new technologies.

However, I still have a lot to learn, so I want to get more experience in some real projects with more difficult challenges.

An experienced backend engineer with 5 years of experience in building scalable, maintainable, and secure enterprise applications. C#.Net is my core technology stack, I have worked with Java and PHP and i am open to learning new skill sets required to get my job done. I take ownership and pay attention to details.

Some of the projects have worked on include:
- Gloepid  Mar 2020 - Jul 2020:

A Covid19 Contract Tracing and Case Monitoring System, i was part of the backend engineers (and led the DevOps team) that built the monitoring system for Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The web API was built with.NetCore using JWT authentication and MS SQL server for data storage. Azure build and release pipelines were used for CI/CD. 

- eProcurement Solution Jul 2020 - Nov 2020

I joined 4 engineers to build an end-to-end electronic procurement tool for the Delta State government (a state in Nigeria). The solution automates the procurement process of the state from tender submission through project execution monitoring and evaluation. I also led the DevOps team, which was responsible for deployment and data migration to the client's Azure tenant. The backend was developed using C#. 
The project helped the state reduced the operational cost of procurements by 15%. It earned the state a world bank grant (as the solution met World Bank's procurement standard). It got the organization a referrer to build for another state (Kwara State)

- Zimvest Mobile Application (Playstore, App store)

A savings and investment platform that enables customers to save and buy investment products in local currency (Nigerian Naira) and US dollars. The solution was built on the microservice architecture using C# for backend technology. The core services include authentication &; authorization service, wallet transaction service, identity verification service, C#. was also used for building supporting background services. Transaction management was powered by an integration service with a core banking app. MS SQL was used as primary DB store.

Users have commended the seamless flow of the application in delivering its functionalities. So far the organization currently records over 15000 daily transactions totalling millions of Naira and thousands of dollars.
"
backend,"- Secured the product's growth, making it 5 times more scalable by refactoring the codebase to the microservice architecture.
- Sped up core functionality development by 400% by building intuitive tools for internal use.
- Delivered high-quality code with 100% test coverage by embracing type annotations and property-based testing.
- Upgraded data collection, making it 3 times faster by fine-tuning concurrent execution.
A python developer with experience in REST API building, technical writing, and property-based testing. I write readable, reusable, and coherent code. As a coworker, I provide a fast feedback loop, ensure maintainability, and stick to the code style.

My development experience has allowed me to build my own product from scratch using Python and Typescript. This expanded my skillset as I also made internal tools and open-source libraries. I enjoy developing projects from the ground up, so no wonder I prefer to start tasks headfirst and learn new technologies on the fly.
I'm a strong believer in mutual respect and efficient communication. Working together, I expect that we:
- clearly define expectations
- trust each other to keep business's interests in mind
- do everything in our ability to see a well-done job
- value each other's time and effort
- respect the boundaries"

As a Trainee Java Developer at EPAM Lab, I was assigned to work on a complex project that involved developing a microservice for a healthcare client. Under the guidance of my mentor, I quickly gained hands-on experience with Java and Spring Boot, and learned how to write clean, maintainable code.

After a few months, I was promoted to the role of Junior Java Developer, and my responsibilities expanded to include writing unit tests, working with databases, and collaborating with other developers on the team. I was also responsible for ensuring that the microservice met the client's requirements for performance and security.

Despite some initial challenges, I quickly adapted to the fast-paced work environment and was able to contribute to the project's success. My efforts were recognized by the team, and I received positive feedback from my manager.

After completing the project, I received a tempting job offer from a telecommunications company, which I accepted. At my new job, I worked on developing software for a variety of platforms, including mobile apps and web applications. I gained experience working with different programming languages and tools, and learned how to debug complex issues using logs and adb.

My journey in software development has been a constant pursuit of learning and growth, and it was during this journey that I discovered the captivating world of Golang. From the moment I delved into Go's simple yet powerful syntax and its focus on concurrency and performance, I found myself deeply inspired by its elegance and efficiency. Learning Go has not only broadened my programming horizons but has also ignited a passion within me to explore its vast potential.

Currently, I am seeking new opportunities where I can use my skills and experience to make a meaningful contribution to a dynamic team.

At first, I worked as a Python and Web development teacher. 

Then I was invited to a Ukrainian company developing an ERP system to work as a person who teaches customers how to use it and helps to expand its functionality with C#, JS, and Python code. I still work here today. Now my responsibilities mainly include the development of an LMS and the implementation of projects that interact with the customer's ERP system. Most of the code is written in C# using SQL Server as the primary DB.

I struggle to see any professional growth opportunities, so I'm looking for a job as a Go or Python developer. I adore these languages and the backend in general. I already have some experience with Python and I've been actively learning Go for some time now, so I think I'm ready to write production code with a little assistance from senior devs.
Would love to work at a place where I can constantly learn and hone my skills as a developer."

Using Java, PHP, and Golang, My main areas of responsibility were the development of new and maintenance of old functionality (and services), ensuring the operation of highly loaded services with 24-7 support, optimization of requests to databases, development and implementation of inter-service communications, and execution of delayed tasks. Planning and launching tasks according to a schedule in microservice architecture.

Another exciting aspect of my career was working with blockchain networks. I led the development and launch of a blockchain network based on cosmos-sdk and Tendermint. I also integrated it with the Ethereum blockchain through a decentralized bridge. This experience deepened my knowledge of blockchain technology and allowed me to explore its backend intricacies.

I have also contributed to startups, actively participating in goal-oriented teams. This involved thorough research, creating temporary solutions, and selecting the most effective ones. My involvement spanned various areas, including private messengers, chatbot platforms, social media and messenger Text analyzers, VoIP systems, browser extensions, and integrations. I also worked on projects involving agronomic analysis and statistical data on weather phenomena, pests, and soil samples.

Throughout my career, I have consistently embraced the role of a developer, as my passion lies in coding and problem-solving. This has granted me a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of backend development.
Participation in the development team using c methodologies (SCRUM / Agile). Ability to work remotely. I would like to practice speaking English (preferably in progress), and a good system of incentives or payment of overtime time, the revision of salaries."

- Continue watching system for video streaming platform:
From the very beginning I myself analyzed and thought out a system for storing 
and processing time stamps that contain information on the time each video was viewed by users on the platform.
I thought about how to store these timestamps and in which of the database.
How to transfer information to frontend clients.
How to make the system resistant to high loads and to make it so it was easily to develop by other developers.

- On another project, we started split the monolith into microservices.
I integrated Apache Kafka into the system to synchronize part of the information through the kafka.

This foundation paved the way for significant accomplishments, including my success in two distinct scholarship programs. One was conferred by the state, while the other hailed from a prestigious company within my nation.
The pinnacle of my accomplishments arose when I secured participation in the highly competitive Codecademy full scholarship professional training initiative. This momentous milestone subsequently led to my appointment as an esteemed instructor within the same organization. Notably, my current employment entails university-level instruction, a role entrusted to me by my current employer.
Moreover, my commitment to excellence is exemplified by my active participation in multiple supplementary training programs, further enhancing my skill set and enriching my professional profile. These achievements stand as testament to my dedication, unwavering pursuit of knowledge, and proficiency within the realm of programming and education.
Presently, I hold the role of a seasoned backend developer and also served as an instructor at universities via CodeAcademy was my previous company. My background encompasses a series of successful projects, notably e-commerce applications and a comprehensive hospital management system developed as an independent contributor.
In these pursuits, I leveraged WinForm for backend development and harnessed Devexpress for creating intuitive front-end interfaces. Within my current team, I lead backend development efforts, from conceptualization to testing, in an agile framework.
My unwavering commitment to growth fuels my ambition to further explore cloud-native technologies for scalable solutions. Moreover, I am dedicated to refining my teaching techniques to impart knowledge more effectively.
I aspire to transition away from my current instructional role and focus on further elevating my professional trajectory. My primary objective lies in collaborating with seasoned developers on substantial undertakings, preferably those involving cutting-edge tools and the latest technological advancements. I am steadfastly committed to avoiding unproductive pursuits, such as engaging in unjust competitions or expending energy on frivolous endeavors.
Furthermore, I am resolute in my preference for team-oriented projects, where collective efforts synergize to achieve remarkable outcomes. Solitary project endeavors do not align with my professional aspirations. My ultimate goal remains centered on contributing meaningfully within a collaborative, innovative, and impactful environment."

 The first is Taxi-Service. The project was where I learned to use a simple wed-application that supports authentication, registration, and other CRUD operations.

 The Second is Cinema-App Online. It is based on the Spring framework. The app has such features: listing movies from the database, entering and updating movies, user registration,
web service for movie information, get users by Email.

I am currently working on the third project with a team of six people from different directions. 

 I am a simple guy who likes jokes and funny friends. I like to communicate with people who know more than me. A few more of my virtues: honesty, communicativeness in the team, sensitivity, punctuality, politeness, problem-solving. Two years of experience working on projects in a team of 10 wonderful people. I am familiar with remote work because I worked and studied remotely during the quarantine.
I expect a good team and interesting projects."

I started my career around 5 years ago as a frontend developer working freelance, later I chose an offline full-time job at the office in Lviv as a backend developer, and very soon I began a project lead and later even Web Team Lead of a whole web team of my current company.

I can not count all technologies I have been working on since my career started, but most of them were related to Node.js, NoSQL DBs, and AWS cloud.

I have a huge experience in building complex apps which serve a million requests. I have experience with database replication and sharding. Some DBs hosted billions of records and included more than 10 TB of data. The size for some indexes were bigger than 200-300 GB.

I have built apps that used not only HTTP requests but also used gRPC, MQTT, AMQP, and other protocols for cross-service communication.
I have worked with JS and tons of NoSQL DBs, like MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB, and DynamoDB. I have experience with AWS cloud.

Now it is time to change my stack. Currently, I am looking for a job with appropriate tech stacks(Typescript, PostgreSQL, GraphQL) in pairs with any cloud provider. Also, I am interested in some technologies that are not so popular, but still enjoyable to play around with. I believe you know what I am talking about. Let me know if you have some insights for me."

Biggest part of my working experience I am the lead developer on projects. So I have to review all done tasks, sometimes to
refactor. Then I need to merge all branches and do it correct with all new features.
One of my projects was so high-loaded in terms of requests per second and logic for these. There was implemented the microservice architecture. So part of my tasks was over the microservices based on Node.js platform. Another part was planing and realizing the database structure for the whole project, RESTful API (written on Laravel) for SPA. I have understanding about the integration with VoIP system, because it was a core of my previous work.
Projects from my another job were related to the real estate sphere. One of them was the API for getting statistics over large records of data. The stack was Nest.js(Fastify adapter), MongoDB. The second one was CRM for the householders. The stack was Laravel, MySQL, Vue.js.

backend,"⇢ Once upon a time, I started to write in PHP... Still alive and, unfortunately, now proficient with it.
⇢ I have my own 'framework' to learn new stuff and manage my knowledge.
⇢ I can operate highly abstracted systems, understand their interconnections, and how to manipulate them. Basically, it's systems thinking.
I've designed and built the back-end system that is used as a single interface to communicate with a variety of third-party APIs. It has different functionalities: from auth to project sharing to flexible user permissions per project to complex data collecting, syncing, processing, and publishing via third-party APIs to real-time notifications and closed super-admin panels, to banks and payment integrations.

I wrote and maintained extensive documentation for the project: starting from very detailed README and data-flow diagrams to easy-to-understand API docs and organized Postman Collections.

I improved some of the team's workflows and inner processes for clearer communication and fewer misunderstandings.

The next stack was used: PHP, Laravel, Passport, Guzzle, queues, schedulers, MySQL, Redis, patterns, notifications through WebSockets (broadcasting), BlueprintAPI, etc.

Before that, for my previous employer, I rebuilt a mid-sized project. This project has huge datasets and has been able to generate highly interactive data-driven entities. There was a closed administration panel to work with user-generated data or already existing datasets.

Here I worked with: PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, Redis, Bootstrap.

Between those two, I used to freelance for small businesses and creative people. Almost always I choose this stack for such projects: PHP, Laravel, Livewire or HTMX, Alpine, TailwindCSS, Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Redis.

+6 years of experience working with Python, 4 of which are dedicated to web development on Django.

I developed my first commercial project when I was 18 years old. It was a local web service for a real estate agency. The service has a database that stores information about each real estate. Users of the agency can view and update the information, using the website.
I created the web service using the following technologies: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and SQLite.

It was a very useful experience for me. because it was my first work with a real client.

After this, I continue to learn new technologies and best practices. At 20 years old I got a second big offer. The offer was bigger than the previous one. I needed to develop a website for a company that delivers cars from American auctions to Ukraine, then fixes and resells them. 

The site should have a catalog of cars and an opportunity to send a request for consultation. I developed the design, frontend, backend, and database.
In this case, I used Python, Django, DRF, HTML, CSS, JS, Docker, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and BASH.

I have 3 years experience in developing web-applications. My greatest passion is JavaScript(Typescript), as it provides wide range of capabilities to deal with both frontend and backend, clouds, mobile, desktop etc. 

I would consider my main experience to be a developer but during my career I was also comfortable to cover the position of tech leader of the team. I worked in projects with different types of management (outsource, outstaff) with Scrum/Agile methodology.

I have some management experience as tech lead in small projects, where I was providing code review, communicated with a client, worked with estimates, project architectural planning, helped team memebers to solve their blockers, set up an infrastructure.

I have worked only with English-speaking clients, so I have such kind of experience.

Backend:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js / Nest.js / any other lib for routing
  - PostgreSQL 
  - Knex.js as query builder
  - ORMs (Objection.js, TypeORM)
  - Firebase and GCS
  - AWS (not very experienced, but open to dive deeper)
  - Redis
  - GraphQL
  - Jest, Supertest

Frontend:
  - React

  - MUI as UI library

Mobile:
  - RN CLI
  - react-native-expo

My main responsibilities including designing, developing, testing and maintaining various web applications using the .NET platform.

I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for N.A.D.A, a dating app. My main responsibility was to design and develop the internal architecture of the application. The development used technologies such as Dapper, MSSQL, .NET Core, Twillio, AutoMapper, SignalR, Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.

One of the app's key features was the ability for users to search for potential partners based on their Location, interests, and preferences. To do this, I developed a robust search algorithm that could quickly and accurately match users based on their profile information. I also implemented a caching mechanism to improve search performance and reduce server load.

As a backend developer of the Tutor app, I designed and developed the backend architecture to support the app's core functionality, including a parent lesson planning system and a points system to encourage children to attend and complete lessons. I collaborated with the frontend team to ensure seamless integration of the backend with the user interface.

I created a full backend application for ""Tridmo"". It included user authentication, database management, file storage (AWS S3), creating rest APIs, payment integration (transaction cloud), and other important tasks. My responsibilities in ""Yamo"" and ""Dizipro"" were basically creating CRUD endpoints, integrating Amazon S3, etc. More information can be found in my CV.

1. Working on an ongoing for 2-3 years platform in a big outsource company. The project was of a considerable complexity, involved 7+ microservices, Apache Kafka, gRPC, complex PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, redis. It was a challenge, but I've proven to be capable of developing new features on a such project on my own. 
2. Working in a smaller outsource company, but developing an MVP project while also acting as a backend lead. My responsibilities involved designing the project, grooming all features and developing most of them from scratch. Big part of my responsibilitiies were communicating with demanding clients directly, where I've shown extremely good communication skills.
Had experience with both monolite and microservice APIs. Paritcipated in development of >5 projects, developed clean, documented backend services, fully covered with unit tests. On the last project was acting as a backend lead (full-cycle), while also communicating with the stakeholders directly.

My responsibilities included:
- development of new features, maintaining and refactoring legacy code;
- covering application with unit tests, maintaining OpenAPI documentation;
- working with AWS services like S3, CloudWatch, SSM, Lambda etc;
- communicating directly with clients/stakeholders, establishing cooperation with 3rd parties, e.g. freelancers;
My main goal is to find a (preferably product) company, where I can work with Senior engineers, and continue gaining experience as a Backend Software Engineer. I'm not interested in jobs that require working on frontend tasks (fullstack)."

Also, I have worked for a while in a product company(Digifoon) and a startup(Timify) which was a great experience and one of the best skill improvements. Summarizing all of that, I am a developer who can work in any kind of environment(IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and build apps of any kind of complexity from small-sized modules to big enterprise microservices. Technically I am a very flexible and fast learner.
Looking for a friendly team and interesting projects."

I started working as a web scraper. I extract data from the web using automation tools like selenium, beautiful soup, etc.. Then I proceeded into software development for a SAAS organization. I implemented new features based on business requirements. I worked on both the frontend and backend. Some of the tools I used are Jira, git/Gitlab, NestJS, graphql, react, etc. I then moved on to manage a team of 10 data annotators to build a computer vision AI model. Afterwards, I moved on to work as an autonomous backend engineer for a crypto wallet payment application using NodeJS/Express. I oversaw development, testing and deployment. Then I joined a new project which uses python with the flask framework. I implemented the entire payment/checkout feature to help users pay in app as quick as possible. I would love to work with a more diverse team and on more challenging tasks.

For CI/CD processes, as well as for the server side, AWS infrastructure was used. I was involved in back-end development in general, although I worked on React/AWS features when necessary. Besides that, I had been taking part in other features/projects, for example: call tracking system (based on Python, serverless), setting-up a docker container for the legacy project, and adjusting HAproxy load balancer.

Always ready to learn new technologies and development methods. Lately, I'm actively learning golang and microservice architecture methodology. In the future, I plan to get deeper into backend and specifically into microservices development for high-load applications.
"
backend,"
I developed the backend part of web applications using Python3 (DRF) and PostgresSQL for almost 5 years. I also have practical skills in git, docker, Redis, Kafka, and the other technologies required for good-skilled developers.
I also have experience implementing column-oriented DB for analytics
I am interested in the development of web applications.
I am looking for the backend python developer position in a product company.
And of course, I don't want to do anything illegal."
backend,"1) Constantly challenging myself with algorithm & data structure problems.
2) Interested in NLP. I found the issue which I wanted to solve. And CTO in my company agreed to add the new feature. So I was working on the internal project where I've created a model for trolling detection (recognition) in Twitter data.
3) Designed and developed a model to solve the anaphora resolution problem (NLP) based on non-negative tensor factorization. Bachelor's Diploma.
I have 7+ years of experience in programming. Last 3 years I was working in product company on commercial project as a Full Stack Developer (PostgreSQL, Java, Django, Javascript). But main tasks were in backend, developing database, building architecture and developing of new features using Django and PostgreSQL. Often solved the DevOps tasks. I'm not a DevOps but I have experience with deploying project. So I'm not afraid of writing config files for Apache server, or Docker files for systems with few microservices etc. Also I was working with AWS (S3, EC2, RDS) through API and AWS Console. Mostly these were internal tools for monitoring and optimizing amount of spent money on AWS, and automation launching huge amount of servers for parallel computations. Also I was working on web scrapers. After collecting all of these data I used Django and PostgreSQL to arrange the data and to make it useful for client. I was working on optimization of queries to db and optimization of calculations of huge amount of data. Sometimes I was working on presenting these data on frontend side. So I know how it works and easily can do something with Javascript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, but I'm not familiar with trend technologies as React or Angular.
I see myself as a Python backend developer (Django). But I opened to new challenges and always interested in trying something new. I like to solve problems and to work in a friendly team. Would be great if I could solve math, analytics or NLP problems."
backend,"- Designed and built complex system for paid advertisement from scratch.
The system is capable of handling large amounts of incoming and outgoing traffic and consists of multiple services that effectively scale. One might call it highload (or might not).
It monetizes traffic by auction system, taking offers from registered users and third-party advertisers (their integrated APIs).

- Established development processes for a small team.
Went all the way through from project estimation and task assignment to building CI/CD infrastructure and planning release cycles.
Mentored other developers.

- Significantly optimized infrastructure costs for company.
Arranged infrastructure migration from cloud to dedicated servers and carefully curated the process.

- Rewrote legacy monolith-based project while providing seamless backend migration for web and mobile apps.
Led API redesign, made it clear and consistent for every team building their new apps for it. Rewriting the project was challenging in terms of keeping both old and new APIs running and synchronized for the process of migration (it went at different pace for the front apps), and reverse-engineering parts of legacy code and features.
I have 8+ years of experience in building web backends using python. I worked for big and small companies, participated in developing projects of different scales - from startups to enterprise systems. I've launched several fast-and-functional MVPs and written high quality, testable and maintainable code.

I always try to find convenient solution for everything I do (no matter either it be a small task or a big project). I have experience in leading projects from specification throughout implementation to maintaining, as well as small teams of developers alongside. I know how to do code reviews from both sides, why tests are important, I keep documentation actualized and strive for simple yet efficient code. 

In my recent projects I've been mostly focusing on asyncio. I've built non-framework apps (pure asyncio) and web APIs using Sanic/Aiohttp, PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy/asyncpg, Redis, distributed task queues and pytest.

Notable technologies I have experience with:
* Python 3.5+ (started with 2.7, but who needs it these days)
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* SQLAlchemy
* Aiohttp
* Sanic
* pytest
* uwsgi
* Redis
* TimescaleDB
* Docker
* Nginx
* RabbitMQ (still learning)
* ElasticSearch (haven't touched for a couple of years)

Will show some code examples at request.
I'm looking for a position where one is supposed to take on responsibilities. Having an experienced and qualified team would also be a huge plus.

Also, please note that there is no Django on my skills set. It doesn't mean that I can't deal with it, I just rather won't. I'm not interested in positions where Django is some serious business.
It would be ok if there are some tasks related to Django, such as supporting or rewriting old projects. It's really not that hard, just don't expect any serious knowledge of it from me."

backend,"As a developer:
I built (one of a kind) financial system which meets business SLA, is scalable, flexible (new logics require no programming), well documented. This system is a part of a payment service provider that processes numerous municipal and governmental payments in EU, let alone regular traffic.

 As a team leader:
 I joined a project when the team has already been formed. After one year I have absolute trust and acquired leadership, despite it is known to be the hardest way (typically a new leader would replace part of his team, if not all).

 As a system administrator:
I was a part of our core team who built one of the top 3 telecoms in  our region.
I have 17+ years of commercial experience on various positions and in different subject areas.

Started off as a NOC (network operations center) system administrator, gradually I switched to full stack web development, and then specialized in backend. I worked with numerous frameworks and tools throughout my career. 

For the last 9 years I work in fintech industry for Ukraine-based product companies. My main specialization is finance systems: building clients' balances, invoicing, reporting, payouts automation, etc. Of course, I am open for new experience.

My current team was formed well before I joined the project. As a tech leader, I put efforts into building a team strategy and processes. I conduct 1-1's and surveys, provide and take feedback. We successfully outsourced routine stuff. All team mates switched to the single tech stack under my supervision.

As a developer, I work on Kotlin, PHP and Java projects. Also, I invest some time into infrastructure improvements, such as: application containerization, collecting telemetry, implementation of a service bus in an SOA environment, etc.

Technologies short list:
 - Java, Kotlin, PHP, JavaScript
 - Symfony, Spring
 - MySQL, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Redis, Memcached
 - ELK stack, Grafana
 - RabbitMQ
 - Linux, Docker, Terraform, CI/CD, Jenkins, Gitlab.

Quick facts about me:
 - 4 years in roles of team/tech lead within last 10 years;
 - Constant learner (books, courses) with focus on team management;
 - C1 (Advanced) level of English (IELTS band score = 7.5/9 in May 2015);
My ideal position requires various skills, such as team leadership, architecture, development, project management, system administration, etc. I enjoy participating in product development and decision making.

My current goal is to develop as a team leader / VP / CTO. I will prefer projects that facilitate this goal. 

An ideal project that I am after is a mid-/long-term project (3-5 years and more) that requires a sound foundation, solid technologies and no “little blood” things.

I am not a good fit for your project if you like to take shortcuts, excessively use frameworks and libraries, create tons of tech debt, often switch context or cannot clearly explain exactly why you need a new person for your project."

backend,"
I can consider both Back-end or Full-stack work. Apart from my freelance work, I worked as a backend developer in two local web agencies and SASS product statup. In the first, I started as a web development team lead, and in the second, I started as a backend developer and promoted to the position of web development team lead. Rigth now, I am working in a software solutions company and working on a big startup project which is SASS application.

I will talk about the three most interesting projects that I have come across.

First, we rewrote the website of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences on Laravel, which was developed in 1995 and was renewed many times. It was an interesting project, because we couldn't interfere too much with the database structure so that the old data would not be lost and we had to code everything according to the old structure. To be honest, I didn't like the new design of the website very much, but since I was working as a back end developer on the project, the fun was on back side for me.

The second project I will talk about is AzalClub, owned by the world-renowned company Azal(Azerbaijan Airlines). AzalClub is actually an ordinary project, except that the data comes from the api, which itselft, it isn't big deal. However, the project is a project that many different developers have worked on in different time periods, as there were some disruptions due to the covid period. That's why when I got involved in the project, the project was a jungle. In general, proper technologies were not chosen for the project. Laravel was used as the back end, but no framework was used on the front end side. That's why the data was pulled directly using only Laravel and Ajax, and since many developers were working, not all of them wrote everything in the right way. So there is a huge refactoring story in the middle. That's why this project has been very interesting for me.

The third project is a module of startup at my current company. The Name of the startup is MagicPort: A platform that brings together many maritime sass applications. Apart from this module, I also provide support for other modules. Module's Name is Digital Daily Reports. It digitize daily reports of vessel workers. It has functionalies of taking daily reports, calculating specific units about maritime, visualising data as charts, importing and exporting data and etc.

backend,"Sometimes in my practice, I have to make a not popular decision. For example one of my projects started from microservices architecture. This approach was popular at that time. But I found that we spend too much time cross services communication. We don't have possible to use some benefits of a database. 
I stopped all work of the team and in opposition to architecture made decision merge all services into one. As result we delived MVP in time. It was stable and works very well with our load. Also, this decision reduced cost for development new features and support.
I have a pretty big and good technical background. Last 6 years worked in different leadership positions and mostly with Golang. In the industry, I'm from 2005 (16 years). Had good experience in starting new projects from scratch and team staffing. Including building distributed teams. As I have a background as a full-stack developer (WEB, Mobile, DevOps, embedded) I can evaluate all work from a different points of view.

I have experience working on various projects across different domains, including travel, real estate, loans, and bank systems. 
  While I primarily used Java in the past, for the last 1.5 years I've been working with Kotlin and leveraging async non-blocking calls. In my most recent project, I gained experience with a high-load application that followed the CQRS architecture pattern as its main style, and utilized DDD within one of its services. This app was deployed on AWS, and I was responsible for implementing new functionality across different parts of the application using various technologies such as AWS Lambda with TypeScript, Kubernetes configs, and pure Kotlin/Spring code. Additionally, I focused on optimizing the application's performance by utilizing caching in the database or Redis, implementing new algorithms, and improving SQL queries.
  In the project prior to that, I developed a real estate app from scratch using a microservices architecture with Java, Spring WebFlux, and MongoDB as the primary technologies. One of my most interesting activities on this project was creating and standardizing configuration across all services and enforcing code style for the entire team.

In recent projects, I have mainly worked with large tasks of automation, optimization and  integrations.
I am looking for a remote Senior Magento Developer position, preferably on M2. Dead inside projects with broken architecture and code standards is a no go for me"
backend,"
I've been in programming since 2016, although my commercial developer experience starts in 2018. The web is my stage. At first I developed client side applications with native JS, JQuery, SASS, HTML, etc. Then there were more modern tools like React / Redux / React Native in my life. So despite the fact I am currently working with server side apps I can consider myself as a T-shaped specialist  with partial involvement in the front-end because I clearly understand what are client interfaces.

Anyway now my way is backend with Node.js,  its frameworks and other cool tools (see my skills). I admire Typescript and can't stand weak tiping anymore.  I usually work with SQL databases  more often than with noSQL, but all of them are understandable for me. Talking about client-server interacting I understand restful API principles pretty well but some time ago I started my first project with GraphQL and fell in love with it. Overall I'm always open to new technologes, knowledge and approaches.

Last several years of my work include:
- development of SPA, mobile POS system and microservices within the system of retail support;
- development of software for a smart hub based on RaspberryPi within the same system;
- creating and supporting the server side of a large high-load public services portal;
- working on an integrable chat service; 
- a bit of outsource: rewriting of legacy php server to Node.js for commercial webportal.

Also I really like when people do their job and not someone else's. Management is for managers, code writing is for developers, so on. I love a clear workflow.
I am expecting: full-time remote or office job, actual or even advanced technology stack, long-term (at least for 6-7 months) and interesting project, medium-sized team, explicit work process, dollar or euro Salary.

I don't mind: moving to other countries at once or later. 

I am not considering: one-time work, contracts for only several months, russian employers."

Our refined model achieved an 85% accuracy rate in predicting pest outbreaks, allowing farmers to take proactive measures and reduce crop losses significantly.

Efficient CI/CD Implementation: I spearheaded the adoption of CI/CD practices within the development team, resulting in a 30% reduction in deployment time and faster delivery of critical updates. This streamlined process also led to a 20% decrease in post-deployment bug reports from users.

Scalable Database Architecture: I designed and implemented a highly scalable database architecture capable of handling large volumes of agricultural data. The new architecture reduced query response times by 50%, ensuring faster access to critical information for farmers and stakeholders.

User Training and Adoption: I conducted comprehensive user training sessions for farmers and agronomists, resulting in a 95% user adoption rate within the first month of system launch. The user-friendly interface and hands-on training empowered users to leverage the platform effectively.

Proactive Bug Fixing and Maintenance: As part of the team responsible for ongoing maintenance, I introduced a proactive bug tracking and fixing approach. This resulted in a 25% reduction in system downtime and enhanced overall system reliability and performance.

Positive Feedback and Testimonials: The project received positive feedback from key stakeholders and farmers, with testimonials highlighting the significant impact on their farming practices and livelihoods.
Over the past few months,I have been deeply involved in a transformative AGRO-INDUSTRY project that aims to revolutionize agriculture practices for farmers. As a key member of the team, my role has been multifaceted, involving various projects and tasks to create a robust and innovative system.

Projects and Tasks Completed:

Backend System Development: I have been leading the development of a robust backend system capable of processing vast amounts of agricultural data and providing valuable insights to farmers and stakeholders. For this, I have utilized technologies such as Python, Django, and Flask to build scalable and efficient APIs.

Stakeholder Collaboration: Working closely with stakeholders and agronomists, I have gathered requirements and analyzed existing agricultural practices to ensure that the developed system aligns with real-world needs.

Database Architecture: I have designed and implemented a scalable database architecture to store diverse agricultural data efficiently. Technology like PostgreSQL have been used to manage the data effectively.

Algorithm Development: As part of the project, I have created algorithms for crop recommendation, pest prediction, and optimal planting times. Machine learning and data analysis tools, such as scikit-learn and pandas, have been utilized in this process.

Integration with External Services: To enhance the accuracy and analysis of data, I integrated the backend system with external APIs and services like OneID, Geoinfocom, and GeoJSON for accessing farmer's land information and contours.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): I implemented CI/CD practices to ensure efficient testing and seamless updates to the system. Tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI have been used to automate the deployment process.

Deployment and Training: I played a pivotal role in deploying the backend system to production servers, ensuring a smooth transition from development to live environment. Moreover, I provided user training to farmers and stakeholders, empowering them to effectively use the platform.

Ongoing Maintenance and Performance Optimization: As a part of the team, I am responsible for ongoing maintenance, bug fixing, and performance optimization to ensure the platform operates flawlessly and delivers a great user experience.

As a Lead Software Engineer and Project Lead, my responsibilities include overseeing the development and implementation of the backend system ,  coordinating with team members

backend,"
I am extremely dependable. I have rarely missed a day's work, and am known for coming in early and staying late to finish important tasks and achieve results. This dependability extends to my collaborative work as well. I always meet deadlines and help my teammates to meet theirs as well. For example, on my last project, a teammate was struggling to complete his assignment for the team, and I stayed late every day that week to help him not only complete his assignment, but exceed our initial estimated turnaround time for the project.
Experience
I feel my 2 years of experience in the software industry is one of my strengths. I’ve been part of major migration efforts and have overseen the upgrade of large codebases at multiple companies. The result of which has meant that I am comfortable navigating the various issues that arise in enterprise-scale code bases. As a business that is transitioning from startup to big company my previous experience in such an environment would make me a perfect fit for the role of Backend developer.

Soft Skills
My soft skills have always been one of my greatest assets. I can effectively and efficiently communicate with a wide variety of stakeholders. In previous roles, I oversaw the building of strong relationships with our core user base. The connections and trust we built allowed us to deliver high-quality features to our users with maximum confidence. It sounds like my communication abilities would be of great use when trying to build and establish a relationship when launching product in backend.

Problem-solving
The biggest challenge as a software developer is to solve problems in an effective manner that fits with the business needs and within time constraints. My biggest strength is my ability to take a holistic approach to problem-solving and make sure that we can coordinate a solution that suits everyone.

Previously, I have worked at large-scale startups with numerous stakeholders all pulling in multiple directions. On project EduCO I was able to implement Database Modeling which helped steer everyone in the same direction.I think my problem-solving abilities could help get the product launched.

During this time I’ve worked with different kinds of architectures such as monolith apps, microservices, and
serverless and can choose/move to the proper one depending on the project and client needs. 
As for programming languages I coded on PHP, Python, and still code on Node JS. As for development practices, I prefer coding using the OOP approach for complex apps and the functional
approach for some scripting tasks.
Depending on requirements and data structure I use SQL and NoSQL as Database layers.
I do like refactoring(when and where it is needed) and always try to increase code coverage(unit, integration) for
an appropriate level to guarantee that applications are stable. Before the development of some functionality, I use the strategy ""Measure twice, cut once"", so I try to understand
the whole flow of the functionality which needed to be implemented to predict the pitfalls and to design the
functionality properly. 
As a team lead, I control the project delivery, communicate across the various teams in order to be on the same
page, and take into consideration possible dependencies between the projects.
Also, I'm reviewing PR's and mentoring team members in order to improve the code quality and to check whether
the implemented feature qualifies the business requirements.

DETAILS
On my previous project for 4 years I worked in different roles - from Junior developer to the main developer on the project. This allowed me to understand business needs and how things go from 'idea' to 'result'. 
I was working directly with a small 'product type' company from France (flexilivre.com). This company allows users to create/buy photo books. Like all other small companies, they strongly fight with their competitors for the possibility to show users their great product. So there were a lot of things that should be implemented in a short time and each time we were searching for some compromise between time and quality, simplicity of solution and possibility to extend logic, etc.
It's important for me to know the project's goals and the way that the project goes generally.

I am sure that only passionate programmers that like their work could produce some decisions that will make the product 'best of the best'. And probably it's possible only when the company and workers have common principles and thinking way.
 
I prefer to have some freedom in time management to not 'looks like a productivity worker' but instead really be productive. Of course only in case when everything works properly and you don't need to fix smth very quickly..."

I confidently consolidated the base of the Python programming language, got acquainted with asynchrony, read books on the basics, algorithms, and Scrum.

My last course was the Python Online Marathon from the international IT company SoftServe, where I practiced a lot, got a lot of new knowledge, worked in a team (team members mixed up with each new sprint), and improved my leadership and communication skills.

I managed to complete several orders for clients, you can see one of them in my GitHub. For all the time of my training, many pet projects were made, but all of them were rather educational. I highlighted the most interesting ones in my profile.

Hi! I have written many projects that vary from direct interaction with HTTP protocol to full-fledged web applications. Only clean code is written and to achieve this I use a lot of principles, tools and technologies: docstrings, typings, understandable variable/function/class names, design patterns, SOLID, DRY, KISS, different tests (Pytest, Unittest, Selenium are used for these purposes) etc.

In almost all my web apps, I use Docker with Docker Compose to simplify the application deployment process. Additionally, it helps me to set up development environment such as creating Postgres, Redis, MongoDB dev-databases etc.

I work on Linux, so due to this fact I can and I do write shell scripts to automate routine processes.

Among all my projects, I would distinguish a Typing Speed Trainer which was developed with Django & vanilla JS. The web application is aimed at improving typing skills in different languages. I created a trainer from scratch using only JavaScript. To make the UI more beautiful, I used Bootstrap. It helped me to create a responsive site and also gave me already predefined CSS styles. To add new ones, I used a CSS preprocessor SCSS. The JS code interacted with several services via AJAX. One service was the backbone of the project — it was storing all necessary user statistics, providing HTML templates, performing authorization/authentication (OAuth2 was used too) etc. The second exposed its API to send random words in different languages to the client. Finally, to tie it all together (databases such as Postgres and Redis, services and Nginx), I used Docker and Docker Compose.

Thank you for your attention! Contact me if you have any questions.

Throughout my career as a Python backend developer, I have worked on a number of important projects,such as DSS, GATEWAY, Social media, Educational Performance System. For instance, I developed a RESTful API for a large-scale e-commerce application, which provided services for product management, user management, and order processing. I implemented secure user authentication using JWT tokens and OAuth2. I also worked on a real-time chat application, where I used WebSockets for bi-directional communication between the server and the client. Moreover, I have been responsible for writing reusable, testable, and efficient code, ensuring data security and protection, and optimizing application for speed and scalability.
I have used a variety of technologies and tools in my role as a backend developer. These include Python, Django,FastApi and Flask for server-side development, PostgreSQL and MySQL for database management, and Docker for containerization. I’ve also used Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for message queuing, and Celery for task scheduling. For version control, I have used Git. For testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), I’ve worked with pytest, Jenkins, and Travis CI.
In my current role as a team lead,I am responsible for designing and implementing server-side logic for web applications, integrating front-end elements into applications, and ensuring high performance and responsiveness.

backend,"I have large experience in architecture development, tasks definition, sprints planning, interviewing and team management. Also I have good maths background, strong understanding of OOP principles and design patterns. I prefer to use agile practices in development process.
Boasting over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I have worn multiple hats - from a Senior Backend Developer to a Team Lead, Architect, and Technology Advisor. My journey has seen me spearheading complex projects, architecting microservices, and diving deep into hands-on coding in PHP, Golang, and Python. I take pride in my commitment to clean, SOLID-compliant code, leveraging design patterns, and ensuring timely refactoring. My proficiency in Symfony, starting from its 2nd version up to the latest 6th, is complemented by my extensive experience in developing robust microservices in Golang and Python.

I have worked with a plethora of data transmission and integration technologies, including gRPC, GraphQL, RabbitMQ, and REST API, as well as databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse, Redis, and Elasticsearch. My deep understanding of these technologies allows me to discern the best fit for specific project needs. Furthermore, my expertise in Docker ensures seamless deployment in Kubernetes architectures, facilitating scalability.

Projects and Achievements

One of the most significant projects I've contributed to is the SaaS product. Aimed at assisting enterprise-level companies in capturing the ""voice of the customer"", this product harnesses big data technologies to gather user metadata and reviews. It offers a suite of tools for analytics and employs cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques for user sentiment analysis and classification. Over the years, I've built numerous microservices from scratch for this product in Golang, Python, and PHP. Recognizing the performance limitations of certain microservices written in PHP and Python, I took the initiative to rewrite them in Golang, resulting in significant improvements in speed and efficiency. My roles in this project have varied from a Senior Developer to a Team Lead and Architect.

backend,"I had co-founded a video conferencing startup, which had whole two clients, one of them being a governmental institution, but it's discontinued years ago. Does this count?

Jokes aside, the only real achievement so far is reviving a dying advertisement startup, which had lame technology & destroyed online reputation. I came there as a middle dev to a team of three developers & two managers and three years later left the flourishing company of 50+ as a CTO.
I design & program highly maintainable systems intended for scale and a long run. Big fan of standards, infrastructure & automation, testing & documentation, fault tolerance, monitoring & reporting.

My developer experience ranges from somewhat regular web development (web stores & social networks) to content management systems to advertisement platforms, then to video conferencing software, and briefly touches (in the distant past, though) CG programming & game development.

Used to be a CTO in startups, gathered & trained teams, worked on project architecture, development & management, but these days I prefer to stick closer to tech & code.

People say I'm kind of good at mentorship — I used to interview & onboard new people, and have given few internal talks on unit testing, SOLID principles & design patterns for the mid & junior staff, and they loved it, and so did I.
I'm looking for a competent & motivated team which has top notch development and management culture or is willing to grow and have one. I can help with the development part.

I'm not a fan of 9-6 work schedule and prefer shorter days or somewhat flexible time. You (well, at least I) can't be effectively creative for 8 hours straight every day. I work smart, not hard.

The actual industry, technological stacks & architectural approaches don't matter much to me, but if I was to choose I'd like to stick closer to strictly typed & compiled languages, and distributed/microservice architectures.

I'm not very good at sysop job. Infrastructure management is a completely different specialty, despite what advocates of DevOps and similar practices have to say, so I prefer to leave it to dedicated professionals."

1. Defined common microservices development approaches for a solar power plants asset management startup using latest technologies which then successfully raised funding.
2. Participated in infrastructure-oriented private Azure marketplace integration project for a big car manufacturing enterprise alongside extremely strong team of Architects and Tech Leads only.
3. Architected and crafted ERP system without DevOps engineers, leading a dream team of rock solid software developers (when the architect had left the company, it was decided I’m the best fit to take his responsibilities on the new project).
4. Implemented distributed tracing for REST API, AWS SQS and Hangfire call chains.
5. Developed custom Saga orchestrator and additional Microsoft Orleans layer on top of it to resolve distributed transactions problems for huge legacy Fintech distributed monolith; it mostly used sync REST for internal communications and thus would require enormous time for refactoring it to async.
6. Written technical articles about distributed tracing and Microsoft Orleans for the corporate blog.

- Ability to distinguish strong and weak sides of technical decisions depending on requirements, thus preventing problems and making the architecture more future-proof;
- Product mindset;
- Used to communicate with both tech and business stakeholders.

Responsibilities: architectural decisions and improvements, CI/CD and infrastructure setup, code reviews, new features, bug fixes, back-end and infrastructure development time estimations for pre-sales, interviewing candidates. Have experience of leading teams up to 5 people.
The company and the project: established product which embraces new technologies and has a clear rodmap is very highly preferable. Anyway, everything which is not enterprise, not bureaucratic and not mostly legacy can be considered. Domain isn't that important.

Role and responsibilites: technical one (not people management). Distributed systems design and back-end development (I will learn front-end if there's a need and opportunity). For the regular development roles the ideal environment is where developers are responsible for as much scope as possible all the way from design to deployment; otherwise, I'd like a position which implies technical leadership. So, the general expectation is a high-level technical decision-making.

Working conditions: 100% remote collaboration with truly flexible schedule where only meetings require sync communication by default. Focus is the key to productivity.

Compensation and benefits: at least 8000 USD net/8500 USD gross per month with Ukrainian market average benefits (36 spare days in total for vacation, sick leaves and national holidays). Without benefits, they're 9600 USD gross per month or 65 USD per hour.

backend,"My main achievement is my experience. I've had the opportunity to gain a wide array of knowledge and skills over the past 5 years and now I'm able to share it with others. I've been able to work on a variety of projects, develop new techniques, and explore various fields, all of which have helped me to hone my skills. I'm proud of the things that I've been able to accomplish in the past few years and I'm looking forward to continuing to expand my knowledge and benefit from the experience I have gained.
For the past two years, I have been working as part of a Scrum team to develop a CRM system for a German educational company. The project was built using a microservice architecture, with Symfony 5 as the main framework, and I would like to continue working with this technology again on future projects. We also use ElasticSearch to optimize search performance and RabbitMQ to facilitate communication between services, as well as to implement a messaging system within individual services.
Before this, I also participated in developing a lot of interesting projects using different technologies: a financial project, a CRM system on Yii2, a social network, a medical portal on Laravel, and various other projects which utilized the aforementioned frameworks, as well as popular CMSs such as WordPress and Magento. I am also comfortable working with Docker during my work.
I am looking for a long-term project that would allow me to work with the latest technologies, with Symfony as the primary framework. Laravel is also acceptable to me but I would not work with WordPress, Magento, Shopify, or any other CMSs. Relocation to another country is a possibility, but only after the current border crossing restrictions are lifted. I am open to exploring new opportunities and expanding my skills, and I believe that the next project could be the perfect opportunity to do so."

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm thrilled to apply for this job as a smart contract developer with more than a year of blockchain expertise. I think my skills and expertise make me an excellent fit for this position.

I discovered Bitcoin in 2017, and I've been using blockchain technology ever since. The potential of this new technology quickly captured my attention, and I set out to learn everything I could about it. I developed a number of applications, including a decentralized version of Twitter and a decentralized voting application, as a result of my interest in blockchain technology. These initiatives were well-received by the cryptocurrency community, and I gained a reputation as a capable blockchain developer.

In addition to designing applications, I have also served as a consultant on various blockchain initiatives. I've worked with businesses ranging from small startups to huge organizations to help them build their blockchains and applications. My work has included creating the blockchain's architecture, creating smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), working as a subject matter expert in charge of identifying bottlenecks and defects and creating fixes for them, and developing and enhancing client systems and key management protection strategies.

To supplement my professional experience, I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science. I have substantial experience creating large-scale concurrent, event-driven distributed networks, with a focus on public-key cryptography and blockchain. I have convincing CS basics, such as a thorough understanding of calculations and data structures, in addition to JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Django. I had a great time working with Web3Bridge. I'm currently looking for a wonderful opportunity to further my career.

I've included my résumé as an attachment for your convenience. Understanding the limitations of the written word, I would appreciate the chance to speak with you in person to address any of your queries and provide a more thorough explanation of my skills.


Yours Sincerely,

backend,"I am top rated on UpWork and Freelancer.
My primary programming languages are C++ and C# under Linux and Windows. I also know Python and JavaScript. I understand the full stack web development, however I focus on the backend. I also can develop desktop apps with GUI.

One role I am interested in is a blockchain and DApp developer. I am learning Ethereum, Solidity, EOS.IO.

My recent experience has been with the development of trading software, which I can continue specializing in, or in broader finance/fintech. I'd be just as interested in a different industry.

My numerous other skills are listed in my resume.

I live abroad and therefore can work only remotely for a Kyiv based company. I am more productive when working from home.

I can work in any time zone from Moscow to Honolulu.

I prefer a permanent job. I am open to a contract as well.

I expect that during the probation period my productivity will warrant paying me $1500/mon. My goal will be to quickly increase my productivity.

The amount of money I am asking for is meant to be all-inclusive. I don't need any social package and I assume that my employer won't have to pay any payroll taxes.

How I Stand Out:
* I pay attention to detail.
* I care to get things right.
* I write efficient, bug free, and well structured source code.
* I take advantage of every opportunity to learn.
* I communicate regularly.
* When paid hourly, I still charge for value, not for hours. I won't charge you for the time spent to learn/research what I am supposed to already know.
* Besides English, I speak Russian and Ukrainian, which makes me well positioned to eliminate the language barrier between an English speaking employer and Russian speaking colleagues.
* To avoid distraction, I work on one project at a time.

backend,"I’m proud of…

— Being a technical lead and a direct developer in successful IT-startup that grew up from four people in coworking to the company with a solid market share.
— Architecting, implementing and maintaining three high-load production systems: BrandLink.ru, Ofd.ru and TrueNorth. 
— Building russian fiscal data operator Ofd.ru named top 1 operator in 2020.

I’m also still a technical scientist in my heart (have not finished PhD grade) and have various scientific publications and scientific work done in off-time with some colleges.
2018 — 2021
BrandLink (BrandLink.ru)

The company has became a major cashback and ad-tech service which connects and communicates FMCG manufacturers to end users through various white-label platforms (mobile apps and websites >1M MAU). 

We were working with major russian and international companies and brands including but not limited to: Procter&Gamble, Mondelez, Mars, PepsiCo, Ferrero, Nestle, KraftHeinz, BurgerKing, X5 Retail Group, Leroy Merlin, Ozon, VKontakte, Yandex, Vimpelcom (Beeline) and so on.

The company has been founded in 2018 with a group of enthusiasts and I’m a de-facto its co-founder.

My role in the team.

As a head of development I played a key technical roles during the project’s lifetime: system architect, tech lead, project co-director, team lead and a senior developer.

Under my supervision and with direct participation the following were developed and launched to production.

1. BrandLink Platform — the heart and the core of the whole system, which stream processes end customer receipts, calculates campaigns and cash backs, aggregates and personalises customer’s offers and analyses their behaviour.
2. White-label solution (frontend and backend) for clients (manufacturers mostly) that uses Platform and connects it with end users, allowing them to scan receipts, search for offers, participate in manufacturers activities and so on. It was called “Publisher”. It was delivered in a form of website or webview, integrated inside mobile app: cashback.pgbonus.ru, beeline.all.promo, perek.all.promo and so on.
3. Management systems for the Platform and Publishers.
4. Integration bridges: Federal Tax Service, Comarch, Yandex.Money, Qiwi.
5. ML-system (TensorFlow/Keras) used for automated classification of goods in customers receipts.

All backend systems were designed either as true micro services or “wide SOA”. Mostly using choreography.

Technology stack: .NET Core 3/6 (C#), Python (+ TensorFlow/Keras), PostgreSQL (EF & Dapper), RabbitMQ, Cassandra, Redis, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Terraform, Gitlab (+ CI), Google BigQuery, Google DataFlow (Apache Beam).

What else.
— Developed the CI/CD pipelines that is used until now.
— Adopted YouTrack instead of Gitlab as PM software.
— Managed a team including not only planning, but supporting team members, mentoring them, hiring and firing.
I’m constantly (but not insanely) seeking to push the boundaries and work with the best to learn from the best.

But I’m not interested in:
— cryptocurrencies;
— govt projects."

Description of my projects

1) GoroSkop Telegram Bot

It was my first app, which I created at the very beginning of my Node.js Developer career. This Bot was developed with parsing technology, which is the main logic of the app. The functionality is: the user can press a button in the chat, and he will receive information from the site with a horoscope. He can also choose an option of automatic prediction for his zodiac sign on the next day. There also a PostgreSQL database connected to this app for storing data about every user.

2) Secret-Santa game

This app was my test assignment at the Yalantis company on a Junior Backend Developer position. It also was a very good practice in creating REST API. The functionality is: the user writes his Name, surname and maximum 10 wishes in the special fields. Then he presses the button “Register” and his information stores in SQLite database connected to the app. When at least 3 users are registered, any of them can click the ""Create Pairs"" button, after which the algorithm will randomly create Santa-receiver pairs and after all pairs are created, they will be shown with all user information.

3) Parse-Excel app

This app was created for the client, who wanted to parse all the information from excel files and receive it in the txt, json and csv files. It is a simple app, which just takes all information from xlsx files using a special algorithm and then creates txt, json and csv files with the received information.

4) Task-Management-System-API

One more app, which was my test assignment at the Milestep company on a Junior Backend Developer. Unlike the Secret-Santa game, this app has not UX/UI. It just a REST API with a several endpoints. The functionality is: the user can register and log in to the app, after which he will receive JWT token, which will be stored in cookies for a week. When the user registers, he will be asked to write his Email, which should be confirmed, so after user writes his Email, the app will send him a special code, which user should enter to verify his Email address. After registration, the user gets access to add/edit/delete tasks in the PostgreSQL database connected to the application. The user can also log out, after which the JWT token will be removed from cookies.

5) Top100Kaspi Bot

This is another telegram bot created for a client I found on the freelancehunt platform. I can't provide more information about my projects due to website restriction.

I have created a variety of applications and websites for my projects and freelance. I used Node.js, Firebase, JavaScript, HTML and CSS technologies for all of these projects. If you want to visit my code, you can go to my GitHub profile. Now, I am studying Computer Science in Yildiz Technical University which is one of the most prestigious university of Turkey.
