A results-oriented and technically sound developer with over 8 years of experience specialized in writing complex queries, database design and migration, ETL processes. I also have experience in web applications, integration services and multi-device applications, which allow me to describe and analyze a project from the beginning to the end.
 Besides, I develop web applications on a project basis.
"
sql,"Ph.D., technical sciences, the topic of the thesis was pattern recognition and  multi-class classification – classic machine learning challenges.

For the Behave project, data processing with recursive call of three levels of nesting stored procedures were developed. Recursion is a common practice for tables (CTE). But for stored procedures, I did not find anything similar on the internet forums.
Machine Learning were used to build models for results forecasting. Accuracy = 0.865 was achieved.
Approaches how to reduce the cost of using Azure Machine Learning Studio were found. 
Easy-to-use structured and well formatted analytical reports for clients directly in Excel format by means of MS SQL Server were created.

For the supply chain management project, I identified issues with the Snowflake Query Optimizer and proposed a solution for this problem. A typical query to update 10 rows in a one terabyte size table took 6 minutes, my approach did it in 5 seconds.
Another problem was a few seconds delay when fetching even small amounts of data. This was not acceptable for the user interface. A solution has been proposed for caching critical amounts of data. The solution was based on the MySQL database with MEMORY storage engine. The solution allowed to retrieve data from a table of one million rows in 0.0026-0.0053 seconds, which is close in productivity to what Redis can provide, but with SQL interface.

At Treasure Data’s Enterprise Customer Data Platform workflows that were implemented using Python have been rewritten using Trino (formerly Presto, SQL Engine for Big Data). Performance has been improved 10 to 40 times. For example, a task that ran for 13-15 minutes began to complete in 18-20 seconds. The workflow that took 2 hours and 20-40 minutes was completed in 4-6 minutes.

During Project 4 SQL scripts for Snowflake monitoring were developed and implemented, as well as logging approaches from Snowflake to Rapid7. Also, proposals for modifying the configuration of the MS SQL Server and Confluent to reduce the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) as well as Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in case of a disaster recovery (DR) were developed.
Skilled database/DWH developer with 20+ years of experience, specializing in Rest APIs, Microsoft Azure, MS SQL Server, Snowflake, Trino (ex. Presto), AWS, Redshift and database administration. Adept at architecting scalable database solutions for enterprise-level organizations. Have a proven track record of high client satisfaction. Dedicated to producing only the best work in the creation of effective and reliable databases/DWHs. Extensive experience with modifying databases, solving issues, and ensuring standards are properly met. Mentored other developers and oversaw the improvement of several applications. Devoted individual with the ability to successfully collaborate with coworkers to produce functional databases and smart solutions. 

Project 1: MS SQL developer at Behave, Luxembourg.
I was responsible for developing of a sophisticated analytical system: Refinitiv’s financial information analysis for investment professionals.
A database was created from the scratch. Extremely efficient stored procedures for statistical and analytical processing of huge amounts of financial information in the context of each day for decades were developed (hundreds of millions and billions of records in tables to proceed). 
Machine Learning were used for results forecasting (MS SQL R Services and Azure Machine Learning Studio).
The active development stage of the system was successfully completed. Used MS SQL, MS SQL R Services, Azure Machine Learning Studio, Azure Data Factory, R.
    Project 2: Database consultant at large German company, one of the activities - providing supply chain management. Very large amounts of data - 30 million new records per day. They planned to switch from Exasol to another, cheaper database. I helped evaluate the Snowflake database. Testing identified issues with the Query Optimizer for queries longer than one minute. A solution has been proposed for this problem. Used Exasol, Snowflake, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Python.
    Project 3: Senior Data Engineer at one of the largest tobacco corporations. One of the tasks: optimize the workflows at Treasure Data’s Enterprise Customer Data Platform. Used Presto, Hive, embulk, DigDag, Python.
    Project 4: Senior Data Engineer at one of the largest fintech (investment management solution) company. I was responsible for developing Snowflake monitoring/logging and disaster recovery approaches for MS SQL Server, Confluent (cloud Kafka), Atlas MongoDB and Snowflake.

My current employer is a call center with their own call center platform that automatically distributes incoming calls, chats, and automatic outgoing calls.

I have been working here for last 10 years on different positions and 5 of them in IT. So I have different but not deep experience

After I took my current position, I received SQL Server 2012 with Windows Server 2012, which was running out of disk space and expanding the disk subsystem that year was not possible. So the first task was to solve this problem in any way, which was eventually solved by removing huge unused indexes and moving some useless information to the NAS in backups.

Later, I improved the situation with DB locks and huge I/O overload by catching heavy queries that were created by SSRS reports created by a reporting specialists(including me in the past). together we have improved performance for all of them.

Last year I proved management we need new hardware and moved everything to Windows \ SQL Server 2019 with new hardware.
I have tried Always On high Availabilty for tests but unfortunately it's a bit not optimal using it on production for us in Standart edition with it's restrictions. So legacy mirroring is currently used.

I spend most of my time maintaining applications related to our call center platform. I provide assistance to customers who have installed our solution locally and to internal customers. This includes reading logs and reporting errors.
I also participate in the business analysis process for the further development of the platform.
Setting up application infrastracture using Hyper-V and Linux(RHEL forks)  machines is also among my tasks.

This year I set domain auth on all production linux machines using active directory Security Groups that helped the whole team with the headache changing their passwords on every machine every month.

In 2019 when I started work in the AzerTurkBank which contains 31 PostgreSQL database and it own processing center. We had a task to migrate all Processing databases to new SSD storage with new security configurations on OS and on Database. Some of database should have migrated with more minimal downtime. For these databases I created new standby databases with new secure OS and database configs on new SSD storage and then switched over these databases. Except this I migrated whole FlexCube Core Banking system database to new Host, OS, DB Software and Storage with SSD. For Core Banking had created 8 physical active standby databases.

In 2017 I migrated core database of retail company called as Bravo JSC. There were 3 database with sizes 10TB, 6TB and 2TB. First two databases were migrated as to standby switchover, but third database and it OS was on bad state. I had to migrate from this database only data to new host and new database software. For third database which size was 2TB I chose schema level migration. I got only data from old database and put it to new database. But all processes were automate for earlier by me using bash scripting and database triggers, for less downtime.

In 2014 we created digital internal document exchange for Azerbaijan State Ministry of Economy called as ""DocNet"". This system database was an Oracle 11g. This system whole database side created by me on the Oracle 2 node RAC and ASM. 

In 2012 together developers we Implemented Core Banking system (Flex Cube) in Parabank JSC. All database side created, developed and implemented by me. After creating whole system for that database environment I created DataGuard system with 10 Physical Standby database.
