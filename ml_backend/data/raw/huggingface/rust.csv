rust,"Learning and then building (designing, implementing, leading) production quality systems:
* custom distribution (BSP/OS) for a device based on GNU/Linux and ARM SoC (Yocto Project)
* upgrade system for the device OS and applications (ostree, meta-updater)
* device provisioning system (initial setup after production on the factory)
* securing, hardening - secure boot, custom PKI, SSL/TLS and GPG - device passes independent penetration testing
* messaging style communication system via AMQP - machines communicate locally on-site as well as report to cloud
* design of device-to-cloud communication via MQTT based on Eclipse IoT projects
* relational database schema design, setting up ORM
* SPI proxy - exposing an SPI bus connected to an ARM MCU on a separate ARM SoC
* high performance driver tracing system, debugger extension
* machine deployment and configuration automation with Ansible (yep)
* documenting!
* tons of debugging (fun!)
* general coding (smaller features that do no include integrating large systems, bugfix)

Working hand in hand with stakeholders - discovering and grooming requirements, designing (some, technical) product features.
I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, team/teach lead and more recently, an architect.
My expertise is spread out working on different levels of the stack, starting with kernel and OS/BSP, networking, security, up to application and database in the cloud environment.
On recent projects I was often in a lead role, working closely with stakeholders and providing technical guidance.
I have performed design, implementation, mentoring and support activities.
Products I was working on fall into embedded, IoT and artificial intelligence categories.

I have done most of my coding in Python (the only one I currently feel proficient at), Shell, C/C++ and C# but I've also implemented some changes in Java and Go.
I am looking for an opportunity to work with Rust and avoid C++ as primary language.

In terms of experience with other systems/frameworks that require learning - Yocto Project, Ansible, operating systems, OS kernel, networking, security and relational databases come to mind. I also have some basic hardware knowledge.

I have experience working with open source software - building and maintaining systems based on OSS, contributing upstream.

I find myself to be a fast and qualitative learner with good communication skills.
I take joy and pride in finding optimal solutions and writing robust implementations.
I like debugging!
In general, I like doing most things (even the dishes!) as long as I can do them 'properly'.
I am looking for:
* A professional team in a company that values quality and adheres to software development life cycle processes.
* An architect, tech lead or principal engineer position - depending on the environment.
* An opportunity to work with Rust.
* Avoid C++ as primary language.
* Preferably (not a must) in an embedded/device/IoT space with challenging constraints.
* OSS involvement."

1. Den of Thieves (1 year of full-time)
    a. Unannounced project, unfinished - I was tasked to port a game from an older modified version of Unreal Engine to a newer one (4.19->4.26), while bringing all the modifications to that new version and adapting them. It was going slow, but I was able to open the project in the Editor, though with a lot of weird bugs. Sadly, at some point the company couldn't afford to keep the development of 2 projects, so the project was archived, and I was transferred full-time to the main project of the company.
    b. Sir, You Are Being Hunted (+ Reinvented Edition), Unity - I was already helping out interns and my bosses with issues while taking breaks from fixing floods of compilation errors in the Unreal project, with both original game unity version upgrade and the reimagined version. With original one, I was helping with fixing bugs and optimizing performance, for both single and multiplayer gameplay. Was also helping with setting up the docker container and maintaining it for a bit for the ""master server"" for multiplayer. With Reimagined, I was still mostly fixing bugs and optimizing other interns' code, but I have also rewritten a big chunk of inventory system, including the way it's UI works and implemented some internal functionality for Thievery - company's SDK for easier integration with popular game development frameworks, like LZ4 encryption/decryption implementation for both desktop and Switch.
    c. ue_rec_dep_seeker - a helper tool I wrote in rust while working on the Unreal project to help me find the root of the ""circular dependency"" errors in Unreal's source code, since it was too much to go through manually.
2. Freelance (0.5 yr)
    a. Ability System, unfinished - my task was to create a framework that, ideally, would be built on top of Unreal's ""Game Features"" but all in Blueprint. It was getting there but the progress was slow, since a lot of ""Game Features"" functionality is unavailable in Blueprints, and C++ code was prohibited by requirements, so I had to think of how to replicate some of that functionality into Blueprints. Unfortunately, I had to stop due to payment disputes.
    b. FPS/TPS Multiplayer game (unfinished and current status unknown to me) - Unreal Engine project, was working on the character code, integrating required plugins and implementing all needed functionality. Unfinished for the same reason as the Ability System project.

rust,"A few weeks ago I participated in an ETH Global hackathon where I was working on the cross-platform service of ensuring funds transactions.
My team and I were selected as the top 10 finalists among all 168 projects. This event was the tipping point when I realized that the blockchain is the area I want to dedicate my life to.
I am a student at the best technical university in Canada, the University of Waterloo. I am studying in the master's degree program in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I am supervised by various blockchain professionals who have agreed to support my master's research
"
rust,"My journey into the dynamic realm of Blockchain and Crypto commenced with a foundational exploration of Solidity, the bedrock of smart contract development. This initial phase involved mastering the intricacies of the language, delving into optimizing gas usage, and honing my skills in the Hardhat development framework. Creating robust test suites using Waffle and Chai became second nature, ensuring the dependability and functionality of my codebase.

Building on this solid foundation, I transitioned into a comprehensive study of security practices. This phase encompassed understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attack, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and more. I delved deep into the mechanisms to safeguard against these threats while simultaneously exploring the realm of low-level interactions, enhancing my ability to craft secure and resilient smart contracts.

Eager to expand my expertise, I delved into a spectrum of ERC standards and associated patterns. ERC20 facilitated the creation of fungible tokens and ERC721 empowered non-fungible tokens. I also gained insights into advanced patterns such as proxy/upgradeable implementations, governance mechanisms, multisig structures, commit/reveal strategies, and timelocks, further enriching my arsenal.
I currently have no commercial experience
"
rust,"
I have a strong background in software development, primarily focusing on backend work. I excel in building scalable web applications, designing APIs, and optimizing database performance.

In recent projects, I played a vital role in cross-functional teams, contributing to backend architecture, complex logic implementation, and third-party service integration. I have a solid understanding of frontend technologies, Linux system administration, and CI/CD practices.

Additionally, I have mentored interns, fostering their growth and development. I have a keen interest in security, participating in Capture The Flag competitions and successfully identifying critical vulnerabilities.

Looking ahead, my goal is to enhance my knowledge in cloud technologies and delve into the world of low-level programming. I am particularly interested in exploring Rust, a powerful systems programming language known for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features. By expanding my expertise in cloud platforms and mastering low-level programming with Rust, I aim to develop efficient and reliable solutions that can tackle diverse projects effectively.

In summary, my experience in backend development, combined with frontend, Linux administration, CI/CD skills, mentoring, and security expertise, make me a valuable asset to any team. I'm passionate about continuous learning and excited about the future of technology.

rust,"Multi Language Bindings Generator writter in Rust with proc macros. Similar to UniFFI from Mozilla but supports more languages - C/C++, C#/CLI, Java, Swift, JS (CEF + Electron).
For the past decade or more my main specialization was Android (from phones to STBs to fully embedded devices). Most of those projects required good knowledge of the C++ language and later also Rust. From time to time I was also involved in Flutter projects and briefly React Native.

I have experience with many different technologies like WebRTC, video streaming / transcoding, 3D rendering (OpenGL to Vulkan to WebGPU), networking (from raw TCP / UDP sockets to gRPC / ProtoBuf to HTTP / WebSockets to WebTransport), Bluetooth LE, Jetpack Compose, JNI/NDK, Code Generation and many others.

One of the latest highlights is the implementation of multi language bindings generator for the Rust project. It was similar to Mozilla's UniFFI but was able to automatically create bindings to C, C++, C# (via C++/CLI), Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript (both CEF and Electron) languages by using procedural macros in Rust.

Always eager to learn new perspective and innovative technologies.

My favorite catch phrase: ""Rust did to C++ what Kotlin did to Java"" !

Some keywords:
- Android - SDK / NDK, Room, BLE, RxJava, Jetpack libraries
- Rust - proc macros, async, actix-web, WGPU
- Kotlin - coroutines, compose, retrofit / okhttp / ktor, jackson / gson / kotlin serialization, Dagger / Koin
- Flutter - GetIT, BLoC, dio, RxDart, Providers, intl, firebase,
- Architectures - MVP, MVVM, MVI, SOLID
- Databases - MySQL, SQLite
- Networking - TCP/UDP, gRPC / protobuf, HTTP, WebRTC, WebSockets, WebTransport, BLE
- Codecs - H.264, H.265, VP9 with SVC

Summary:
- main specialization - Android, Rust
- great at Android, Kotlin, Rust
- good at Flutter, Java, C++, Dart languages
Don't really like AOSP or system-level programming in general.
I know Flutter but would like to avoid it."

rust,"Until 2022, I've developed Aspose.Words for C++, and started managing the small team of C++ developers (4 people).

Under my leadership, the team has achieved the following things:
- We have published Aspose.Words for C++ library and we continue regularly delivering new releases.
- We have added support for Linux and macOS.
- We have continuously improved the quality of the library
- We have improved performance, memory consumption, library size
- We have added new features from the main product
- We have fixed issues - memory leaks, differences in behavior (Rendering, etc.)
- We continued developing the C# to C++ translator and system libraries.

In particular, I dealt with the following things:
- I have developed multiple LLVM-based tools for C# to C++ documentation conversion and C++ include headers management.
- I have developed C# to C++ translator. It simplifies, adapts, and translates C# statements to C++
- I have set up and supported CI/CD infrastructure for C++ development.
Right now, I'm interested in blockchain-related tasks - smart contracts development and infrastructure around. I'm considering switching to Rust.

Until 2022, I have been C++ Team Lead for a small team (4 people). We have developed C# to C++ translator and used it for developing Aspose.Words for C++ product (C++14, Boost, ICU, Skia).

* Lead a team of 7 engineers.  Our team rewrote the cluster orchestration system from Haskell to Python/Bash/C in 5 months.  The resulting system was simpler, faster, and easier to maintain.  We had eliminated lots of complexity by reusing off-the-shelf components (Consul, Pacemaker HA) and getting rid of hairy stuff like home-brewed Paxos implementation.

* Maintained a cluster orchestration system — 50K SLOC of Haskell — that I inherited from a team of 5 contractors who disappeared.  For 2 months I worked alone, then my colleague from another team joined.  I organized a Haskell study group, and in 6 months we had grown a team of 5 Haskell developers.

* Designed and implemented the configuration subsystem of the object storage system.  Programmed a library for modular initialization/finalization.

* Wrote helper tools for developers.

rust,"At the State University of Telecommunications, I invented, developed, and deployed a remote computer supervision solution for teachers using the Go programming language. A central server would receive updates from agents running as headless Windows service on computers in the classroom, and allow issuing remote commands like to make a screenshot, or shut down the computer, or show a text message to a student - and so on. 

At Telecard-Prylad Ltd., as the sole young administrator in my department, I created a solid virtual infrastructure with PKI for remote work of 2 distinct departments during CoVID-19. As a developer, I wrote a distributed (w/o blockchain stuff) content-addressed file storage site in Go and did some low-level network programming for Software-Defined Radios with a very low bandwidth-delay product metric. Had major contributions to the project architecture design and development. 

At Elastio Inc., I designed and developed a relatively simple but sufficiently generic and mockable user interfacing library to decouple other libraries from specific implementations of user interfacing logic as provided by the application code, allow automated responses to interactive queries, and have statically typed response variants. Introduced support for ARM architecture to our product, which includes relevant CI/CD changes, modifying code and build scripts, and introducing changes to product packaging and distribution (supply chain) process. Made foundations for Linux (systemd) and Windows (SCM) agent service, had experience using both Linux and Windows system APIs.
5 years of experience with a wide range of tasks, going from low-level system programming and ad-hoc networking to cloud-native applications and edge computing. My preferred programming languages are Rust, Go, Python, C, and some C++ (familiar with Qt). Have experience with Java, C#, Kotlin, and Lua. Good understanding of Git version control system, slight DevOps skills, and interest in cybersecurity. Expertise with both Linux and Windows software development. Known natural languages: English (almost fluent), Ukrainian (native), and Russian (native). Have solid self-teaching (autodidactic) skills and a high level of patience. 

- 1+ year of part-time employment at my alma mater - the State University of Telecommunications, Kyiv, where I used to perform some help desk tasks and did some Go development in 2018. 

- 2 years of rich, full-time experience in Telecard-Prylad Ltd. (specialized in military and industrial tech development) as a Software Engineer and System Administrator. Extensive Go programming and occasional C; on-hands experience with both Linux and Windows; hosting and reverse proxying Node.js and Java web servers with Nginx and Caddy, including use of Docker; Bash scripting and helping out Python (PyQt) developers; research and development of networked solutions and experiments with various network protocols and message queuing - MQTT, CoAP, HTTP/QUIC, mDNS, bare UDP multicast, and so on. 

- Almost 2 years of full-time remote employment at Elastio Software, Inc. (via Polytech Software outstaffing) - low-cost, cloud-native backup solution for AWS and on-premise alike. Being in the data plane team, I did system programming mostly - but I also had experience with some AWS services like CloudWatch, EC2 and EBS volumes, and ECR registries. In addition to programming, I had DevOps experience around GitHub Actions CI/CD infrastructure with self-hosted runners, running virtual machines built using Vagrant and Packer for both automated and manual code testing, and Docker for static (musl-based) builds.
Long-term employment opportunities are most welcome. 

Quite often, to comprehend tasks I get, I need to understand from the end user's perspective scenarios in which particular features would be used. I frequently think in terms of user experience (or developer experience if it is about some refactorings) and it is not uncommon for me to comment and reiterate on the UX of various parts of the product. 

I prefer smaller groups working on solid technologies with weak time frames, rather than careless prototyping with stressful deadlines. I expect my team to be actually interested in the product they are working on - and I do dedicate myself to the job."

Greetings, and thank you for visiting my profile.
To save your time I will be brief.

I completed a Computer Science degree with the emphasis on systems programming. To build up my knowledge of this area and to gain additional programming practice, I implemented several non-trivial projects using Rust from corresponding domain.  

- A compiler for Java programming language. This is a sandard single-threaded single client approach with many moving parts. I wanted to better understand how object-oriented programming langauages work under the hood so I implemtned one myself. 
- An operating system for a Beaglebone device, am335x processor.  Just like compiler, it was build from scrach, which means that all the tools This project had a very heavy emphasis on baremetal programming. I really like embedded programming sand set of challegnes that I had to overcome helped me to develop. 
- An SQL database engine. 
- A distributed key-value storage engine.  

All of them were build from scratch and involved minimal use of Rust external libraries. Nevertheless I am quite familiar with the ecosystem and can use external library when it is needed, including declarative and procedural macros. 

If you intend to to look at projects to asses my skills and level of competency I highly recommend you look at my GitHub where I left slightly more detailed description of each. It should give you (hopefully) a very good idea on where I stand. 

In addition to Rust, I am familiar with C. Several of my unversity courses used this as a programmig language. Same goes for Java programming language, which is based on Principles of Object-Oriented Design course. Nevertheless, I acquired more. Additionally I should add JavaScript to the list as I have spent quite some time self-teaching myself in order to implement a few decision tooks for my brother in law. Finally I participated in EPAM C# course and I am vaguely familiar with corresponding programming language. 

Well, this is it. I am looking for internship or entry-level or maybe similar role where my skills would be a good fit. I think a conversation from the interview should give you a good idea on where I stand. 

Thank you for your consideration and looking forward to hearing back from you.

I have been working in IT industry since 2016. I was involved in a number of commercial software projects. I have solid knowledge of object-oriented programming and embedded systems. My strongest skills are C/C++ and embedded systems. I consider myself as a highly motivated person and always learn something new. I have great attention to details, logical and methodical approach to achieving objectives.

I started my journey in CS as a C/C++ developer. I've been studying in this direction, participating in courses, and even passed my first interview also as a C/C++ developer. However, somehow it happened that I had to work on my first job as a front-end developer using BrightScript language :)

After a year and a half of working as a front-end developer, I decided to return to C/C++. I moved to backend development, which is unusual for C/C++. Of course, we also had to work with SQL on the backend, namely with the PostgreSQL database. The project also used Common Lisp, so I worked with it for a while too.

After four exciting years in a product company, I decided to change the domain of work and moved on to a project in AI and deep learning field. I was working on the optimizations of low-level DNN operations using OpenCL and CUDA running on GPUs. It's a fascinating field, and I think I will still be working with it in the future.

But for now, I'm curious about trying myself in Rust. As a C++ developer, I'm a big fan of Rust. I started learning it not so long ago, but I have already, of course, read ""The Book"", passed ""Rustlings,"" and am currently at the final stage of our Ukrainian ""Rust Summer Bootcamp"".

Participated in Int20h hackathon (2019)

I've been learning English since the first-grade at school, can easily communicate with foreigners (B2+).
Warning! This description is WIP. I am currently not interested in hiring since I already have a decent full time job. Will get back to fixing this when needed. It's here from the times of me being a junior.

Young and passionate developer.

2+ years of personal development in Rust, C/C++, Typescript!

I am an active contributor to rust-analyzer, made some pet projects and university course works:

An interpreter of a custom C-like dynamically-typed language in ""C"".
Bluetooth guided flamethrower little automobile project made with C++ and Arduino Uno.
A client-server windowed application is written in C++ with Qt framework for real-time document editing (like Google Docs).
A bunch of websites with GraphQL API, Node.js, TypeScript, Angular and Docker.
Discord bot for music and other commands, written in TypeScript.

Commercial experience:
7 months as a Node.js developer (AWS microservices) at EPAM and was already promoted to Middle software developer.

I rapidly learn everything that interests me and Rust is one of my favorites!
Other topics of my interest: WebAssembly with C++ via emscripten (going to learn Rust tools too), graphics and game development, non-standard tasks and challenges.

I'd like to find a job to work with Rust. The subject area of its application doesn't matter too much, I am ready to learn new stuff and harness the newest technologies and approaches the modern world introduces. No mentors are needed (though not prohibited ;)), I am self-taught and can grow independently. E.g. I took the first place at Web DEV Challenge 2019 in Node.js nomination, though I didn't have any commercial experience with it at that time.

I am currently a 3-d year student at KPI and I live in a dormitory (moved from Sumy).
Product company. I don't want web frontend jobs (though I am proficient with Angular)."
