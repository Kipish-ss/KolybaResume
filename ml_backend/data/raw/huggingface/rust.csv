Lately worked a lot with WebRTC, GStreamer, mediasoup (co-maintainer) and Rust, built large-scale streaming/recording ecosystem of products/features from scratch (architecture, backend implementation and frontend SDK for the rest of the team to integrate with), mostly in Rust. Before that worked on modernizing/rewriting legacy PHP/JS/TS codebases for scalability, high availability, observability and increased performance (orders of magnitude lower latency or increased throughput).

Know PHP and TypeScript (and JavaScript, LiveScript, CoffeeScript) very well, but nowadays prefer Rust whenever applicable and will only consider PHP if it is being actively migrated from.

Know the basics of modern cryptography, interested in distributed privacy-centric systems (have built own special-purpose DHT from scratch).

Packing software into containers and running with Docker since 2014, before it was cool :)

Few notes about past experience:
* always worked on very custom projects that do not have of-the-shelf solutions
* can debug and fix complex code, occasionally even obfuscated if there is no other way around it
* strongly self-motivated engineer with ability to focus on the task and find solution without any supervision and guidance, will reach-out for help as needed
* not very skilled at motivating and managing others
* can and will argue about solutions that I think are more appropriate (simply because I'm working with team and focus on result, not participation), you should be ready and open-minded
* money is important, but product vision and team culture is even more important

rust,"I tried to include my accomplishments in the ""Work Experience"" section.
I have been working for 1,5 years at a company which creates a crypto exchange, which is now in closed beta. 90% of the code were written in Python. I had experience with such technologies as asyncio, SQLAlchemy, Tornado, Opentelemetry, Datadog, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, k9s (for k8s monitoring), S3.

Regarding my personal contributions:
- I have implemented distributed tracing for a distributed system using latest standards. I did some code profiling and made sure it adds no more than 3% burden on each module. It helped to discover and eliminate various problems within our code.
- I set up metrics for a various modules using Prometheus.
- While implementing tracing and metrics, I have learned how trading-system components work, including matching engine.
- I implemented and enhanced user authentication, using 2FA and Captcha verification.
- I implemented or worked on several microservices.
- I have implemented reconciliation process, which collects the data from various sources within the system and sends them to the matching software. I think the main challenge was to automate the process and make it failure-safe/idempotent, so that if it fails in the middle, it can simply be re-started without complex actions or manual clean-ups.

Up to this point, in my job, I have learned how to design reusable classes, how to design the software in the way that it requires less maintenance in the future, think about potential problems including race conditions, consider how various things affect system-level and module-level performance.

The workflow in my workplace included various clusters, such as local/dev, qa, staging, production. Also, we employed Agile workflow and used Jira.

Also, I have 2 internship experiences, each of which were 2-month long. There I tried some frontend coding, writing backend in Golang, designing DB schemas, writing communication module in Python's asyncio, etc.

I have studied OS, Networks, Systems Programming, Concurrency&Parallelism courses well in the university. I have graduated good school in Kazakhstan. Then I graduated KAIST with cum-laude.

I like singing, playing guitar, outdoor activities.
- I am not expecting to work in a crypto-related company. Any domain is fine.
- I want to work in a relaxed work environment. I would prefer not to have high expectations to avoid pressure.
- I want to have enough time to write high-quality code, which means it would be cool if we have clearly defined requirements for the project and no rush.
- I would like to always have an opportunity to make little-maintenance, readable, efficient code. Not just software that simply works.
- I would like to code in Rust, if possible. But that, of course, would mean I will need some time to learn in order to be able to write production-level Rust code.
- I would like to have days-off on Kazakhstani public holidays + 20-30 days of vacation + easy opportunity to take unpaid leave in case I have some problems or when I am sick.
- I would like to have flexible work-hours.
- I would NOT want to have colleagues which don't know English.
- It's a remote work. So I expect there will be almost no welfare; gears are also not provided. Thus given there is no stock options or stakes at the company, I would expect a good salary."

Now I would want to either find an interesting project in Python which will allow me to also use Rust for speeding up,
or to join Rust development team and get some commercial experience with it."

For the past decade or more my main specialization was Android (from phones to STBs to fully embedded devices). Most of those projects required good knowledge of the C++ language and later also Rust. From time to time I was also involved in Flutter projects and briefly React Native.

I have experience with many different technologies like WebRTC, video streaming / transcoding, 3D rendering (OpenGL to Vulkan to WebGPU), networking (from raw TCP / UDP sockets to gRPC / ProtoBuf to HTTP / WebSockets to WebTransport), Bluetooth LE, Jetpack Compose, JNI/NDK, Code Generation and many others.

One of the latest highlights is the implementation of multi language bindings generator for the Rust project. It was similar to Mozilla's UniFFI but was able to automatically create bindings to C, C++, C# (via C++/CLI), Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript (both CEF and Electron) languages by using procedural macros in Rust.

- 2 years of freelance. I worked as a full-stack dev, developing apps from zero to production. These apps mainly were focused on selling goods.

- 3 years of a full-time job at ScaleTools AG as a web developer. I was a part of a team working on a cloud-based app. My responsibilities were designing the internal architecture of apps, writing code, and supporting it. 
Later I was a leading developer responsible for several products that were parts of a microservice infrastructure.

I've decided to change the tech stack and switch to Rust. I wrote several rust-based pet projects such as a TUI bookmark manager, and a simple client-server GUI game based on a TCP connection. I'm interested in web3, blockchain, desktop, and system programming.

In addition to development, I can build effective distributed teams from scratch.

Key information

I have been working remotely since 2005. I am able to manage the technical process (implement continuous integration, automated testing and static code analysis), form the architecture of the project, motivate developers to improve their skills, train less experienced employees.

I am able, and I like to create modular systems. I prefer to work on a high-tech stack, but I can work with a legacy code base, changing it evolutionarily and leading to a more up-to-date state.

- Golang: 4 product projects with unit and acceptance tests
- Machine learning: vision, search + opensource
- PHP: Doctrine 2 ORM, Yii, ZF, Laravel, PHPUnit
- JavaScript: TypeScript, Angular, i-bem, Vue.js
- Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Reindexer, ELK
- Tools: terraform, helm, kubectl, linux, bash, git, vagrant, docker unit-testing, webpack, gulp, bower, composer, enb
- DevOps: Azure, GCP, PaaS, LAMP|LNMP and etc environments, kubernetes
- Learn if necessary: Haskell, Python, Archetype, Michelson, maybe C++

- Write code and code review
- Mentoring team and sharing knowledge
- Design architecture and manage product features
- Control and support SRE
I will consider it a bonus if your company uses open source and methodology OKR

Anticipation
I am looking for a job where, besides writing code and reviewing it, I can manage the process (performing continuous integration, automated testing and static code analysis), shape the project architecture and influence the product features, and have the opportunity to motivate developers to improve their skills.

I expect to see my efforts reflected in the overall success of the company and have the possibility of career development depending on the goals reached or the increased responsibility."
rust,"15 years in software development. 10 years developing cross-platform/Linux applications with C++, 1.5 years experience with Go, 0.5 years of commercial Rust experience (land non-commercial before that).

I have experience in solving different kinds of algorithm problems, optimizing and benchmarking heavy load tool, designing architecture.
Also I have an experience of being a Team Lead of a teams of up to nine members.
I've participated in developing various products using C++/Rust/Go/C# stack. My role was Senior C++/Rust engineer or Tech/Team Lead.
Currently I would prefer Rust rather than other languages but that strongly depends on the project.

The projects were in Blockchain, finance, big data optimization, GIS/LiDAR data processing, document processing domains.
I'm looking for a challenging project that requires solving sophisticated technical and algorithmic problems.
I'm NOT interested in developing car media applications, embedded development and gamedev.

rust,"
I have worked as a software engineer for more than 15 years. I have vast experience and took part in many projects: networking, automotive, audio processing. But now my main focus is backend development.
I like building complex scalable systems which serve millions of people. At the same, I can dive deep into individual components in order to understand how they work and if they match the system architecture.
I like learning the programming languages and frameworks because this allows looking at eternal technical challenges from a different angle. But my main principle is that engineering skills are more important than knowledge of particular technologies. This is the key to making things done.
I have team-leading experience. I believe that soft skills are equally important and try to develop myself in different directions.

rust,"Helped to solve relatively big problem with already-shipped devices in short amount of time, which prevented customer dissatisfaction and negative product reviews.
Introduced code reviews, code style convention, pull requests, GitFlow and repository branch naming convention to the back-end team. Also initiated migration to Jenkins.
Orchestrated functionality transfer from a buggy legacy back-end to the new one.
Worked on multiple embedded and IoT projects, as well as a back-end developer for various services. Most interesting ones:
1. Medical handheld device. I was responsible for development of settings storage and memory manager for the device, as well as the bootloader with OTA update support. The project was build upon strict coding standards (MISRA-C) and optimised for speed. Almost entirely written from scratch by the team. Technologies: C/C++, Redis, MQTT. Unfortunately, the project was closed due to lack of investments (there was an alternative solution on the market built on Android).
2. Indoor positioning system. Also a medical project for the same company. I was responsible for project prototyping (using Python on Raspberry Pi) and back-end development. Technology stack I worked with for the project: Bluetooth LE, Python, Redis, RabbitMQ, Grafana, Matlab.
3. Smart doorbell. Smart home device with features such as video calls, suspicious activity tracking and very long battery life (months of 24/7 work without charging). My tasks included complex bug solving, major code refactoring and development of a secure algorithm for certificate OTA updates on the devices. Technology stack: Embedded C, Python, AWS, Jenkins, various hardware debuggers and measuring devices.
4. Distributed control and tracking system. Complex distributed network application designed for extremely low bandwidth networks. Technology stack: Golang, C, Protobuf, RabbitMQ (MQTT and AMQP protocols), PostgreSQL, RESTful API. My tasks: system architecture, back-end technical leadership, development of internal tools.

All of the above projects were managed using SCRUM methodology, so I'm fairly experienced with that too.
I prefer small teams (6-10 people) in not-so-big companies. Currently interested in working for a product company. I want to work with a team of talented developers who know what they're doing.

Preferred languages — Rust and Golang."

Roci.fi
RociFi protocol is a DeFi primitive for permissionless under-collateralized lending. Built on Ethereum, RociFi will launch initially on Polygon. RociFi is reinventing credit to be more inclusive while increasing capital efficiency in DeFi by leveraging on-chain behavior and reputation to issue under-collateralized loans. As the protocol grows in adoption, it will function similarly to a Layer 1 whereby DeFi and TradFi firms can build new capital markets services atop RociFi, thus creating a decentralized credit economy.

rust,"Took the first place at Web DevChallenge 2019 in Node.js nomination.

Participated in Int20h hackathon (2019)

I've been learning English since the first-grade at school, can easily communicate with foreigners (B2+).
Warning! This description is WIP. I am currently not interested in hiring since I already have a decent full time job. Will get back to fixing this when needed. It's here from the times of me being a junior.

Young and passionate developer.

2+ years of personal development in Rust, C/C++, Typescript!

I am an active contributor to rust-analyzer, made some pet projects and university course works:

An interpreter of a custom C-like dynamically-typed language in ""C"".
Bluetooth guided flamethrower little automobile project made with C++ and Arduino Uno.
A client-server windowed application is written in C++ with Qt framework for real-time document editing (like Google Docs).
A bunch of websites with GraphQL API, Node.js, TypeScript, Angular and Docker.
Discord bot for music and other commands, written in TypeScript.

Commercial experience:
7 months as a Node.js developer (AWS microservices) at EPAM and was already promoted to Middle software developer.

I rapidly learn everything that interests me and Rust is one of my favorites!
Other topics of my interest: WebAssembly with C++ via emscripten (going to learn Rust tools too), graphics and game development, non-standard tasks and challenges.

I'd like to find a job to work with Rust. The subject area of its application doesn't matter too much, I am ready to learn new stuff and harness the newest technologies and approaches the modern world introduces. No mentors are needed (though not prohibited ;)), I am self-taught and can grow independently. E.g. I took the first place at Web DEV Challenge 2019 in Node.js nomination, though I didn't have any commercial experience with it at that time.

I am currently a 3-d year student at KPI and I live in a dormitory (moved from Sumy).
Product company. I don't want web frontend jobs (though I am proficient with Angular)."
