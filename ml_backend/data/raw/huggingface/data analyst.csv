There I have been making an analysis and predictions concerning the video advertisements. It involves retrieving data, using R, Excel and PowerPoint for calculating and visualizing the results, and presenting the results at conferences and meetings. Making templates and calculators for automating the processes. After the war started the media market fell and I was able to enter the United Kingdom team. Therefore, since May 2022 I have also been working as a Data Visualization Manager in “Dentsu Data Labs” in the UK. My goals there are Data retrieving (manual and automated), data transformation (using Trifacta or R), and data visualization (using Tableau). Moreover, I continue maintaining templates in the Ukraine office.
I expect to work with data in all forms of it. Retrieving the data, exploratory and further analysis, future predictions, data modelling, creating visualizations and insights."

Although I've been engaging in analytics for more than 10 years, it was only recently that I realized that the position of Data analyst was the most attractive to me. After mastering the necessary skills (SQL, Python (libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI), I was only convinced that I had made the right choice. 
        Now I'm working for an outsourcing company that serves a network of American online stores. I process various price file formats in MS Excel. I have extensive experience with Google Sheets and correspondence with the American side. In my previous job, I worked as an analyst in the sales department of a large supermarket. My main responsibilities were operational analysis, forecasting, and control of financial indicators. I worked in MS Excel, used SAP Business Objects and Power BI reporting. I think this experience will be useful in my new job as well. 
       I would like my new job to involve both data processing and analysis, as well as data visualization. I am considering moving to Data Science in the future.

data analyst,"I think it is stress resistance and the ability to find a way out of difficult cases. To be more specific, one of the most recent situations was a failure that occurred due to the human factor of one of our colleagues. This miscalculation led to an incorrect display of the estimated date and time of arrival of shipments in customers' express waybills. This mistake negatively affects the company's reputation in the eyes of the client, as it misleads them. Therefore, it was important to promptly identify the error in one of the transportation schedules and eliminate it, because a large logistics company creates a significant number of express documents every minute. After correcting the error, it was necessary to quickly select the entire number of express waybills with deviations and overwrite them, because if more than two hours had passed since their creation, the situation would not have been corrected.

Five years ago, I began my professional journey as a math tutor for standardized tests like SAT, GRE, GMAT, and YOS. Being a local Math & Physics Olympic Medalist, I possess a wide range of interests, from social sciences to technical science. After trying my hand at web programming and design, I realized that my nature is inclined more towards solving complex problems. In my previous job, I discovered the world of data science and pure data analysis. I developed a CRM system from scratch to collect and analyze data, and in the process, I learned how to direct my colleagues to collect clean data. Via my CRM system, all the departments of our company can work in harmony as our company group has large companies in different areas. I also developed various techniques to enhance our sales and employee performance and how to collect precise data. I regularly analyzed customer data and employee performances with my CEO. In this process, I started solving LeetCode and Project Euler problems alongside Ecole 42's Piscine C problems. I began my journey in Python and Data Science, starting with Data Analysis, as I possess technical knowledge, good mathematical and statistical knowledge, and good social observation skills as per my type (ENTP/INTP). Being a multidisciplinary learner, I enjoy researching concepts like ""why?"", ""how"", and ""what will happen."" I am keen to join a team where I can contribute my skills and learn from their experiences.

Competency: Web application developer
Hello :) Overall I have ~2.5 years of experience in IT. However, there is one small problem - it doesn’t match what I am looking for  

My latest experience is being Python SDET (a pretty not bad one). I was involved in 3 different projects, working in a team or alone, developing auto test frameworks from scratch or supporting existing codebase; being responsible only for the development or also participating in product meetings. (In order not to distract you from the important paragraph below, I leave the list of my projects’ for the CV).

However, I realized, that it’s not what I want to do and the job I’ve done is not what I am truly passionate about. In such hard times, I’m still looking for myself and now I am on the way to a career switch. I’ve decided to gain a degree in linguistics (I’ll be happy to tell you why at the interview ) and currently I am attending university classes. But I still know Python, I still enjoy it as a tool, and I like working with data and delivering valuable insights from it in the easiest and most efficient way. So, my perfect job would be some part-time project related to Text processing, with elements of NLP or at least with Text data, which I can have fun with.

Why do you need me?
- I have commercial (and not only) experience, I know how to work;
- I am familiar with technologies for data analysis: Python, Pandas, Jupiter Notebook, NumPy, SQL, Excel, etc.;
- I love learning, almost every project I had to learn some new technology and work with it, which I did successfully;
- I have tech education and I am familiar with math concepts; 
- I like working in a team, I don’t hesitate to ask questions and at the same time I can work independently pretty well;
- I care about the results I provide and the progress I do.

PS. I love learning, especially learning by teaching, so I’ve been mentoring newcomers, organizing Python courses for kids, and tutoring there.
What I expect:
- Part-time project (~20 hours per week or less);
- Work with data, perfectly if it is Text data and NLP technologies are used in the project;
- It can be an analytical job, some manual Text processing, but be ready that I will want to automate things that it’s possible to automate :)

My preference is a long-term cooperation, however, as a start, I also will be happy to work with some short-term projects. 

And that’s it. The only thing I want to avoid is a job matching my previous experience. 

Thank you for reading my profile, if you feel that we can be a match, I would be glad to start a conversation, though if not, I wish you a good day and to find a great candidate!"

To solve the problem of modeling the relationship between the parameters of the public debt and macroeconomic indicators, a model of simulative equations(SEM) and a Vector autoregressive model(VAR) were used. The econometric toolkit made it possible to compare the developed resume_classifier in terms of forecasting and to describe the nature of interaction through the main factors affecting the size of the domestic public debt. Some statistical tests were also applied.
3. Scientific work, which became the winner of the international competition of student scientific works on the basis of Mykhailo Ostrogratsky Kremenchug National University. I used and compared between each other the diskriminant analysis model, logistic regression model and simple neural network model for task of classification of debt sequrity of Ukraine based on dynamics of macroeconomics indicators.
4. I`m also tried to single out precisely the monetary managed indicators and their separate interaction, which affects the size of the domestic public debt. I applied and compared the Vector error correction model(VECM) and the autoregressive distribution-lag model(ARDL)

I managed full-stack web apps, websites, CRM systems, dashboards for the Business
owners, CEO, and CFO: profit analysis, revenue reporting, sales distribution, effectivity, and
financial metrics. I have conducted several market research (gathering data) and created
long-term prognoses, based on predictive analytics. For the team leads, I created reports:
on sales, client relations, communication, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
In one of the projects I managed the creation of a CRM system within the Oracle
environment for a big industrial company with a T-SQL database of 2000 clients with
contacts, interactions, and prospect data; summarized 20Gb data in reports on financial
results, departments, countries with multiple optioning; implemented data mining and
predictive analytics methods; optimized production plan according to the most profitable
sales prediction and workforce distribution - everything was based on complex queries. I
also worked in the Upwork internal system, which used Postgre SQL to operate billions of
rows with complex queries, joins, and access rights.


I am proficient in working in the Google environment (Google Cloud, Google Scripts,
Google Analytics) and data visualization tools like Google Big Query, Data Studio, Tableau,
PowerBI, and Excel Data Analysis pack, integrations of Salesforce, Priority, and
Woocommerce sales data into analytical dashboards (REST API, API integration, pipelines
to analytical dashboards (BigQuery, Data Studio).

"
data analyst,"
I have 2 years of experience, during which I have done all kinds of analytical tasks with help of Python, SQL and Excel, from just transforming datasets and gathering insights to constructing complex algorithms.

On my first job I was just completing technical tasks on processing and transforming data, mainly using Pandas and adding libraries as needed. For example, I have developed a script which takes geographical coordinates of any point on the US map and constructs a list of all postal zip codes around this point within specific distance, with data such as population, size and so on. Then I took these zipcodes and divided them into arbitrary number of clusters with similar size and population using ML libraries like scipy and TPOT. I have also completed tasks with calculating something in Pandas dataframes, pulling data from API and so on.

On my current job I've been processing and analyzing data on startup ecosystems. We construct rankings on startup ecosystems based on the proprietary algorithm with complex calculations and about 40 different parameters. Here I'm very involved with Python (Pandas, Numpy, requests, some data modelling), SQL and complex sheets in Excel and Google Sheets, constantly pulling data from the database and REST API.

data analyst,"I haven't had the chance to work on business projects thus far, but I do view my achievements in academia as a testament to my abilities. For example, I worked on a project, where I gathered neuronal activity data from millions of neurons within the visual cortex. The nature of this neuronal data was diverse so I utilized various tools, including a Python-based GUI, to clean and classify it based on correlations.

Subsequently, through extensive reading of scientific literature and active engagement with my mentors, I formulated a hypothesis that shed light on the mechanisms of neuronal activation. I used MATLAB and Python to handle substantial datasets. Utilizing statistical approaches, I unearthed patterns within the data and constructed visual representations that effectively communicated my findings. Ultimately, I successfully defended my thesis, marking an accomplishment.

data analyst,"
I have worked in the consulting domain for nearly three years, including 2,5 years for EY Ukraine. In general, consulting experiences got me to understand the best practices of running a different kind of business and how to interact with other people while working as a team.
During my advisory journey, I participated in projects, mostly both as a data and business analyst. I was responsible for the following tasks:
•	Developed automatic templates for the budgeting process using VBA, and Power Query for state energy company
•	Advised a solution to maintain an item dictionary and further editing in Power BI to fulfil budget forms smoothly
•	Created visualizations in Power BI to highlight analysis results
•	Generated insights for customers segmentation 
•	Advised how to improve performance in sales distributing policy based on sales data
•	Developed an algorithm for transforming data into usable information
•	Review the client's passage through the sales funnel
•	Communicated with the development team to meet the client's needs during the financial system implementation project
•	Held data migration process to a new financial system
•	Designed financial business processes, using BPMN, for a newly launched government healthcare agency
Due to the wide range of professional growth and my employer wasn't interested in my data analysis skills- and toolset development, I decided to take a gap year to get into data analysis deeply.
Over the gap year, I built a strong pillar using analytical instruments such as SQL(MySQL, PostgresSQL), Python(NumPy, Pandas, SciPy), and Power BI. Nowadays, I am improving my skills in statistics, including AB-testing and regression analysis. 
I tend to provide data-driven decisions and insights for a company."
data analyst,"Maximizing the power of data has always been fun for me and brings a sense of fulfilment — the challenge of using numbers to tell a story and convey an idea.
One remarkable period my resilience was tested, was getting Executives onboard for the data strategy project. It is a known fact that Executives play a crucial role in the crafting and realizing an organization’s data strategy and when Executives are yet to see the need for a data product, then the question of “How do we get management to agree that our organization needs to pivot into the adoption of this BI tool?”. 
I worked with a Data Scientist who at the time helped build resume_classifier which were impactful for detection and descriptive analysis, however stakeholders had not seen a reason to adopt the technologies necessary to deploy such a product.
So, I went ahead and scheduled a meeting with all necessary stakeholders, I went ahead and translated the insights into a dashboard using the free tool of Google Data Studio showing them the advantages of adoption. Some of this would be showing the Fraud team how the Machine Learning Model could help flag suspicious customers, the Client Experience Managers how the RFM model could help with the classification of customers and study behavioral patterns and reduce the customer churn rate from 40% to 15%. 
Although this took about 8 weeks of sharing actionable insights with stakeholders and strategic sessions, the organization eventually made the decision on the adoption of the BI solution.
I have worked on a number of projects which was beyond the tools but also about understanding the data and extracting important information. These projects covered the different dimensions of  analytics: Descriptive Analytics, Diagnostic Analytics, Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics. Some of the projects have conducted used data to improve revenue, launching a data-driven product, improve existing product offering, correlation analysis, market research.
For these projects I leveraged SQL, Python, PowerBi and code scheduler (for the automation and code scheduling).
"
data analyst,"
I have worked with Power BI (+Power Query), SQL, Alteryx, python, and API, working with Google Big Query and Data (Looker) Studio right now, and sometimes use Google Sheets.

I want to grow into Data Scientist some day, but for now I know that I have a lot to learn as an Analyst. I'd really like to try working in a startup
I want to work with a motivated team that I can learn from. Want to improve my skills and grow to a Data Scientist someday."
data analyst,"
I have working knowledge of advanced SQL, and I've had the chance to write SQL queries using SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL. In one of my projects, I used SQL Server to query a sales database, identified duplicate transactions and used windows functions on it. The resulting table was exported to Power BI for report visualizations.
I have also done Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Going forward, I hope to take on projects/work that require more of Python, SQL and BI tools.
"
data analyst,"At the age of 18, I launched my own project, BaBulochka, a social bakery that assisted senior and retired citizens in getting additional income. Moreover, every employed pensioner found relief from loneliness. The project won the ""Studway"" Award in the Category of Social Entrepreneurship and 4th place in the all-Ukrainian competition of social projects.

I published a book of short stories called ""Third person plural"", some of which are reflections of my journey across Ukraine.

I became a finalist in the marketing competition, the Unilever Future Leaders League.

My project, U4Ukraine, won a Paul L. Pfeiffer Student Startup Scholarship.

My last initiative was the ""U4Ukraine"" store in the state of Ohio and later an international project with over 45 sites around the world. These experiences have taught me the specifics of the global market.
I humbly believe that I have the necessary academic background to perform well at my apprenticeship, as during my university education I have acquired extensive knowledge in financial analysis and valuation, derivatives, econometrics, mathematics, and statistics. In addition, I have completed courses in Econometrics, Corporate Finance, Excel, and SQL, and currently I am improving my knowledge of Python by completing DataCamp courses.

My motto is: « If you want to learn something, the best way is to immerse yourself fully in the field and learn on the go from the best people in the team ». That is how I became the youngest intern at Dragon Capital, a leading Ukrainian investment management company, and worked in the compliance department. During my time there, I gained valuable experience in various aspects of investment banking, including financial analysis and market research. Moreover, I had the opportunity to work on several projects, such as partnership agreements, and prepare financial reports for the company's management. 

What is more, I worked at a Ukrainian’s government entity – CMU Reform Office – where I analyzed regional budgets on the subject of investment in local SMEs and science. I continued to work on this topic during my bachelor thesis by expanding the observation period and creating multiple econometric resume_classifier through Eviews to conduct comprehensive research.

Finally, I consider that I have acquired extensive hard and soft skills during my academic and professional experiences, which would allow me to easily integrate within your company. In fact, I am able to adjust to new environments with ease, as for the last two years I have lived in various locations and have had a number of cases where I had to live, work, and study in multicultural teams. For example, I moved to study economics and work in the US, which broadened my horizons and gave me a better understanding of international finance.

"
data analyst,"
Java Software Developer & Data Analyst seeking professional opportunities. I have one year of Java experience and expertise in Java Core, Spring, and Hibernate frameworks. Proficient in OOP fundamentals, I have implemented diverse Pet projects and handled tasks beyond the scope of my main projects. My current progress on Codewars is at 5 kyu, showcasing my problem-solving skills. With excellent communication abilities and fluent command of Polish and English, I am an effective team member. 
I will try to describe a bit of my Pet projects. I decided to implement a project named ""Taxi service app"" where I show my ability to work with Databases (MySQL: RDBMS). This app is a simple simulation that requires a registration or authentication process for access and includes necessary CRUD operations. There I show the ability to work with JSP pages. The next app, which is mostly based in Spring technology, is ""Cinema app"". I added the validation process that checks if the user was already registered or not. This app is dedicated to managing all processes with a cinema ticket system (e.g. registration, find movie, add to shopping cart, create order and so on).

The structure of both apps was based on N-tier architecture, which is the core idea and the core concept of building Java programs. It was a simple and quick review of my Pet projects. I should add that I also have experience with different tasks and technologies. So feel free to contact me for additional information.

In the field of data analysis, I have developed proficiency in:
Data Visualization: Utilizing tools like Tableau, Power BI, and matplotlib to create impactful visualizations that communicate insights derived from data effectively.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data using libraries like Pandas in Python, ensuring its quality and usability.
SQL Query Execution: Strong command of executing SQL queries to extract relevant data from databases, including writing complex queries to meet specific requirements.
Database Management Systems: Solid understanding of database management systems, their architecture, and functionalities. Skilled in storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.
Combining my Java development skills with expertise in data analysis, I offer a unique perspective and contribute effectively to projects involving software development and data-driven decision-making.

Over the past three years, I have gained valuable professional experience in two distinct roles: one year as a Business Development Officer and two years as a Junior Data Analyst. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set and a deep understanding of both business strategy and data analysis.

As a Business Development Officer, I played a pivotal role in driving growth and expanding the company's market presence. I was responsible for identifying and pursuing new business opportunities, conducting market research, and building strong relationships with key stakeholders. I developed effective strategies to generate leads, nurture client relationships, and close deals, resulting in a significant increase in revenue and customer base. Through my work, I also contributed to the development of innovative marketing campaigns and helped improve the company's competitive positioning in the industry.

Transitioning into a Junior Data Analyst role, I embarked on a new journey to leverage my analytical skills and contribute to data-driven decision-making. In this position, I worked closely with large datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and generating reports for key stakeholders. I applied statistical methods and data visualization techniques to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities that informed strategic business decisions. My proficiency in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools enabled me to streamline data processes, automate reports, and enhance overall data accuracy and efficiency.

Throughout both roles, I have honed my communication skills by collaborating with cross-functional teams and effectively presenting complex information to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

At the end of February of the year before last, I set a goal for myself: by the end of the year, I would devote more than 1000 hours to the theory and practice of data analysis. These include Python programming, SQL, Data Science, Machine Learning libraries, data visualization, Power BI/Tableau, math and statistics.

Finally I became a Data Analyst at CPA Network ClickLoop. This company promotes various applications.

My area of responsibility included collecting information on all resources, analyzing client data, searching for dependencies and correlations, as well as a robot using SQL
An environment that drives personal and professional growth. Data Science assignments are also interesting although my profile is closer to the Data Analysis domain."
data analyst,"
Previously worked as Support associate and support Data Analyst, created dashboards and visualizations for B2B, and supplied training and AM teams with interactive Dashboards for B2B interactions. Also created metrics and calculations and automatized support reporting, results, and processes monitoring.

Currently, work in Data Science (previously known as Risk Team) as a Data Analyst, where I do the following tasks:
- daily/weekly fraud detection scripts and alert creation
- users/clusters/locations investigations
- Kibana Dashboards creation for reporting purposes
- existing products analysis for further improvement
- data visualization

I do not consider working ONLY with such tools as Tableau or Power BI/Excel. If you have python/SQL-related projects, I will be happy to see the details
"
data analyst,"My first achievement was joining to clinical research company without experience in this field. In a short time, I adapted to the specifics of work in clinical research and significantly improved the capabilities of the team and the company in existing projects.
With just 6 months of experience, I became one of the key persons in the team and later received a leading position.

I have a lot of experience with risks and instant reactions to the project's risks. One of them is: the customer changed priorities of collecting biological samples for international shipment on aircraft with a fixed departure time one hour before the flight. My team was able to complete the task, I prepared all the export documents and satisfied the research timelines of the customer.

In clinical research, I have experience with all types of work: aliquoting blood into tubes, negotiations with the customer, the development of documents for the international shipment of biological samples, verification of an established oncological diagnosis, entering data into the database, revision the company's standard operating procedures in conducting audits. 
I work like nothing is impossible.

Despite working in the clinical research field, I am fluent in IT terminology and I have personal experience with several programs. For example, I prepared my CV in Figma, before that I tried to create projects in JS and Python.

I have a deep understanding of the nature of setting the rules, so even without reading the current one, I already know the boundaries of any operation.
Previous position: Head of Data and Logistics department (CRO, not IT) in 2020-2022 years.
Responsibilities:
- Provided leadership to Data Analysts, Supplies Managers, Logistics Managers, Office Managers, and Laboratory Staff
- Performed the training of the personnel in every team
Managed the projects from initiation to closure in the data part, solved project issues/queries
- Secured program resourcing and participated in the recruitment of project resources when required
- Created/edited/pre-approved the Project Documentation (Project Specifications, Standard Operational Procedure, Statement of Work, other)
- Created the forms of automatic tracking of the project status on a daily/weekly/monthly/annual basis
- Communicated with clients on a daily/weekly basis
- Investigated the risks related to project deviations

I was not only involved in the management and coordination of people because I had my own tasks and responsibilities as a logistics manager.

Four years of my work in numbers:
Projects I participated - 310;
Projects I took part in as head of department - 160;
Maximum number of projects I managed at the same time - 12;
Clients who asked specifically me to lead their projects and notify them in a planned way - 5.
"
data analyst,"Currently, the segment I work in is Support, and my recent achievement is a successful usage of the TFIDF model to predict the request type of a ticket/request coming from Email as a source (and containing no type identified, therefore). Based on the identified request type, the ticket gets directly assigned to the correct 2nd level agent, which helps us to reduce first-level support agents' overload. The implementation of my solution helped my team to achieve this goal.
Primarily, I analyze data with the R programming language. My current skill set includes data manipulation, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, reporting with R Markdown (interactive reports), building shiny dashboards of different levels of complexity. I have a strong knowledge of statistics. I also use SQL to query data from databases. In my current work, I combine all of the above to help my team make data-driven decisions.
I am on my way to becoming an exceptional data scientist, so do not expect from me a strong knowledge of machine learning. Right now, I am a true data analyst with a background in statistics. 

I prefer to work with the R programming language, exceptionally, so please do not captivate me with Python or Excel. I am also confident with working with BI tools and SQL, but it's important for me to use R studio in my work as well."

"
data analyst,"I have been able to help a fashion company keep one of its stores it intended to close open as a result of insight gotten from visualisation done based of the dataset they presented. The visaulisation made me critically think as to what caused other stores to pick up in sales and customer retention at different points in time, and why the store the client had wanted closed did not improve at all.

After some critical thinking and investigative analysis, I discovered the reason other stores picked up was because one of the employees had started investing her resources in developing her customer and sales skills and had influenced her other colleagues. She had built a sub-structure in the stores she had worked, these were the stores that were performing well.

The knowledge of this insight made the stakeholders in the business invest more in developing the soft and hard skills of their employees and also promoting the particular employee that was responsible for the ripple growth in their stores.

It is an accomplishment to me because i was not only able to help keep one of their stores open, my critical thinking and investigative analysis skills was able to give an employee a promotion.

data analyst,"Pivotal Role at Amazon: As the only Business Analyst in my department at Amazon, I undertook the immense responsibility of building in data visibility for the entire team. Through my initiatives, I successfully onboarded my team to the Business Intelligence (BI) System. This involved creating automated dashboards leveraging both internal and external data sources and extensively using SQL to offer data support.

Significant Cost Savings: One of the most tangible impacts of my efforts at Amazon was the realization of a substantial cost saving of €1.1 million. This accomplishment not only underscored the value of data-driven strategies but also highlighted my ability to harness data for tangible business benefits.

Rapid Skill Acquisition: Recognizing the importance of data analytics in the modern world, I embarked on a self-driven educational journey. Within just two months, I successfully completed over 20 online courses, focusing on analytics tools and programming languages. This not only reflects my dedication but also my ability to quickly grasp and master new concepts.

Certifications from Industry Leaders: To further validate and reinforce my expertise, I secured certifications from renowned industry giants like Google and Microsoft. These certifications not only bolstered my credentials but also provided me a competitive edge in the data analytics domain.

Transition into Data Analytics: Despite starting my career as a Civil Engineer, my profound interest in data analytics coupled with my strong foundation in mathematics allowed me to pivot into the data domain. I secured a role as a Data Analyst at Freedom Pay, marking my first professional foray into implementing data and analytics in business processes.
Projects and Tasks Completed:

At Amazon: As the sole Business Analyst in my department, I undertook numerous projects, including the onboarding of my team to the Business Intelligence (BI) System. I designed and developed automated dashboards leveraging both internal and external data sources.
At Freedom Pay: Transitioned from Civil Engineering to my initial role as a Data Analyst, marking my entry into practical data analytics within business processes.
At Micromasters from Georgi Tech: Created several individual projects using R and Python on Machine Learning Models with validated efficiency and accuracy.

Technologies Used:

In addition to tools and systems specific to Amazon, I extensively utilized SQL and BI Systems for data support and extraction, backed by Advanced Excel (Pivot, Macros, etc.) and programming languages R and Python. My skills are also reinforced by certifications from notable organizations like Google and Microsoft.

Current Role in the Team:

At Amazon, I was the only Business Analyst for my department. This position came with the significant responsibility of ensuring data visibility across the team, creating valuable data resources, and delivering critical data support to my colleagues, which ultimately led to significant cost savings.

Areas of Improvement:

While I have made considerable progress in the realm of data analytics, I am continually inspired by the ever-evolving nature of this field. Given the growing importance of data in today's world and my foundational background in mathematics, I aim to further enhance my expertise in advanced analytics tools and delve deeper into emerging data-driven strategies to magnify their positive impact on business processes.
Deep Application of Data Analytics: With the world's increasing reliance on data, I expect to be in roles that allow me to leverage my analytics skills to their utmost potential. My experience at Amazon demonstrated the profound impact of data-driven strategies, leading to substantial cost savings, and I anticipate further opportunities to optimize processes and influence strategic decisions through data insights.

Collaborative Environment: At Amazon, I was the only Business Analyst in my department, which, although rewarding, made me realize the importance of collaboration and collective knowledge sharing. I'm eager to be part of teams where there's mutual learning and where I can both impart my knowledge and benefit from the expertise of others.

Continuous Learning: The realm of Data Analytics is ever-evolving. My self-directed learning journey, which included more than 20 online courses in a span of two months, highlights my passion for keeping up with the latest trends and technologies. I expect roles that challenge me, pushing me to broaden my horizons and stay updated.

Areas I Prefer Not to Venture Into:

Monotony: Given the dynamic nature of my past roles and the rapid pace at which I've learned and adapted, I'd prefer not to be in positions that are too repetitive and don't challenge me to think out of the box or innovate.

Limited Scope for Growth: I am ambitious and always on the lookout for growth opportunities, both in terms of role and learning. Positions that have a narrow scope and don't offer room for personal or professional development are not in line with my aspirations.

Purely Theoretical Roles: My stint at Freedom Pay and Amazon underscored the importance of practical implementation. While theory is vital, I wish to steer clear from roles that are entirely theoretical and lack real-world application."

1) conversion of the ""Buy"" button in the product card (Mobile) was increased by at least +10%;
2) team efforts managed to achieve an increase in the conversion rate for viewing information about the seller in the product card (Desktop) by at least 15% while reducing the number of user complaints to support by about two times;
3) was avoided the implementation of an experimental variant that could worsen key metrics by at least 20-30%;
4) the creation and implementation of an advanced Tracker of ideas and A/B tests helped reduce the delay between the end of the previous test and the beginning of the following test by at least three times and, in general, highly increased the quality of the testing process.

My passion is using thinking potential at the maximum to find/produce valuable insights/solutions for significant improvements in the business (like maximizing profit, minimizing losses, internal processes optimization, etc.).

"
data analyst,"One of my significant achievements was earning a promotion from ordinary sales assistant to department manager in my previous role, becoming the youngest manager in 22 . Through dedication, hard work, and consistently taking more initiatives, I demonstrated my commitment to the company's success. This recognition not only validated my efforts but also allowed me to take on higher responsibilities and contribute to the growth of the team. 

Another achievement was the clear identification of my vocation within the professional sphere. Through self-discovery, continuous learning, and exploration, I honed in on my true passion and skill set. Being a Department Manager in a retail store I used to work with different Looker studio data dashboards and I understand that finding solutions and insights is something that I really like. This realization empowered me to pursue a career path that resonates deeply with my interests and strengths. So I decided to learn more about this sphere and started a Data Analyst course.  

I consider the act of making well-informed plans for the future as a significant accomplishment. After starting a Data Analyst course I set some goals for the nearest 5 years not only in a professional direction but also in other spheres of my life such as health, hobbies and family. By setting clear goals, charting a course of action, and outlining steps toward achievement, I demonstrated foresight and determination.
While learning Data Analysis I mastered all necessary technical skills for completing projects from scratch. First of all I covered more complicated MS Excel and Google Sheets functions, learned SQL and wrote complex codes to extract useful data and create new using different aggregation functions. I also got acquainted with main product and marketing metrics for better understanding of companies' needs. Then I started to get deeper into visualization by using BI tools (Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI) to create a story with the data.  Experience with GA4 and Big Query helped we to better understand Web and Product Analysis. 

Project Experience
1) Expenditure & Marketing Analytics
I created a Looker Studio dashboard that represents marketing expenditures and main metrics which shows results of each campaign. I used heatmap to visualize metrics such as CTR,CPC,CPM, ROMI and Total Spend by each marketing campaign using colors. On the top of a dashboard are displayed different totals. 

2) Onboarding Funnel in a Product Company
    As a data analyst I finished a project which involves creating a data visualization in Tableau that tracks and analyzes the process of users onboarding. The dashboard includes high-level metrics such as conversion rates between stages, number of user sign-ups, time-to-completion analysis and funnel visualization. 
While completing this project I used LOD expressions, date and aggregate functions, quick table calculations and parameters. 
This project will come in handy to improve the onboarding process by enhancing user retention and satisfaction.

3) Revenue Cohort Analysis in Tableau
     Using cohort analysis I showed how different groups of customers contribute to revenue over time. I also calculated New Monthly Recurring Revenue and Total Revenue Ratio to the previous month. The goal of this project is to uncover insights into customer behavior and revenue generation patterns, enabling companies to maximize revenue growth.

4) Revenue Analytics in Tableau 
Product Revenue Analysis dashboard introduces main revenue metrics in different cuts. It shows monthly Average Revenue Per Paid Users (ARPPU) and number of Unique Paid Users. You can also see there a heatmap which demonstrates Total Revenue by Products with different colors.
In my future role as a data analyst, I have several expectations that I believe will contribute to a fulfilling and successful career journey.
I look forward to continually enhancing my data analysis skills. As a passionate learner, I expect to engage with challenging projects that allow me to expand my technical proficiency, master new tools, and refine my problem-solving abilities.
I am excited about the opportunity for significant career growth. I anticipate taking on new responsibilities, progressing to more senior roles, and becoming a key contributor to the team's success.
I believe that learning is a collaborative effort, and I expect to be part of a team where mentorship and knowledge sharing are encouraged. I look forward to both receiving guidance from experienced colleagues and contributing my insights to help junior team members in the future. 
I hold company values in high regard, and I expect to join an organization that aligns with my principles. I look forward to working in an environment that emphasizes  positive workplace culture, work-life balance and diversity."

By conducting regular market research, I was able to identify potential growth areas and make recommendations on how to optimize our operations and improve our services to better serve our customers.

Another important aspect of my work was fraud control.

1. I systematized the organizational structure and made position coding for convenient use (e.g. during bencmarking of salaries or perfomance review).

I have worked at EY 3 years and during this time I've learned how to organize my time properly, how to work under pressure, when deadlines press on my throat; learned multitasking (although I don't really believe in doing several thing at once, but I think multitasking is the skill how to switch between your tasks quick).

data analyst,"I have been granted the opportunity to partake in the esteemed ""Data Skilled Bootcamp"" as a recipient of the Technest scholarship program, which is jointly organized by the Innovation and Digital Development Agency and Taskilled. During the ""Data Skilled Bootcamp"" within the Technest scholarship program, I am dedicated to expanding my proficiency in a comprehensive array of essential tools and concepts in data analysis. I am currently immersing myself in learning R, Python, Power BI, SQL, and statistics with R. These skills are integral to effectively analyze and manipulate data, visualize insights, build interactive dashboards, and extract valuable information from databases. By acquiring proficiency in these technologies, I aim to strengthen my analytical capabilities and gain a deeper understanding of statistical methodologies for data analysis. Through this bootcamp, I am confident that I will be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the rapidly evolving field of data analysis and contribute meaningfully to data-driven decision-making processes.
While working as Data Analyst Intern at GI Group, I have done the following tasks:
Developed a sales dashboard using Power BI to visualize sales data for the company.
Technologies used: Power BI, data sources (Kaggle).

Developed a database to manage employee information, including personal details, job information, and Salary details. Created tables for departments, positions, salaries, and link them with the employee table.

Technologies used: MS SQL.

While studying Data Skilled Bootcamp by Taskilled, issued by Technest Scholarship,
I have gained practical experience in a variety of tasks and projects related to data cleaning, visualization, and modeling. I have successfully completed data cleaning tasks using tools such as Power Query, R, and Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and transforming variables to ensure data quality. I have also utilized my skills in R and Python to create visualizations, leveraging packages like ggplot2 and Matplotlib/Seaborn, to present data insights effectively. In addition, I have utilized Power BI to create interactive dashboards, connecting to various data sources and implementing advanced visualizations and filters. Furthermore, I have experience working with MS SQL, creating tables, and writing queries to extract and manipulate data efficiently. On the modeling front, I have implemented regression resume_classifier including linear and logistic regression, and have even explored automated machine learning techniques like AutoML. For instance, I have applied these resume_classifier to housing and bank datasets to predict housing prices and classify bank customer behavior.

Self-employed , developing my own pet projects 2022 - till now
I conducted data analysis for Takflix, an online video streaming service, focusing on two key metrics: customer loyalty coefficient and gift coefficient.
Through this analysis, I provided Takflix with insights into the loyalty of their customers and the effectiveness of their gift program. These findings can help inform strategies for customer retention and loyalty-building initiatives, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the online video streaming service.

I developed a module for finding the best machine learning model.
The module I created employs techniques such as grid search CV to explore different combinations of hyperparameters for each model. By systematically evaluating the performance of various resume_classifier and their respective hyperparameter settings, the module identifies the model that yields the best results for the given data.

I performed time series analysis on data from retail stores, specifically focusing on using ARIMA resume_classifier and studying the data for stationarity.
In my analysis, I utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) resume_classifier to capture the patterns and trends in the retail data over time. ARIMA resume_classifier are commonly used for time series forecasting and can effectively model the dependencies and variations in sequential data.

In my analysis of YouTube trending data, I explored various aspects of the videos, including view counts, likes, dislikes, and comments. I conducted sentiment analysis on the comments to gain insights into the overall sentiment expressed by viewers towards the videos. Additionally, I employed clustering analysis to identify patterns and group similar videos based on their attributes. By combining these approaches, I obtained a comprehensive understanding of the popularity, sentiment, and categorization of the trending YouTube videos.

For example, I wrote code for SQL queries where I joined and unioned 2 tables in a CTE to extract the needed data, used aggregation functions to structure the data, counted marketing metrics (particularly, ROMI), and then extracted only the data that matched certain conditions.
In another project, I used 3 parallel CTEs (each extracted certain data or transformed it into the needed format), used COALESCE and CASE functions, changed the date format, used window functions with the LAG expression, and counted marketing metrics (CTR, CPM, ROMI) and the percent difference of each metric month by month.
In one of my BigQuery projects, I counted conversions from session_start to purchase regarding certain dates and traffic channels. This query included examples of CTE, a CAST function, a JOIN function, and counting of unique user_sessions per each step, a certain date, and a cartain traffic channel.
All these SQL projects can be found on my GitHub profile.
Ideally, I would love to work on freelance projects or in the field of outsourcing / outstaffing. My oral English level is Upper Intermediate and my written English is closer to Advanced. I have great experience of working with the American, Canadian, British market (and practically anywhere around the world) in content writing regarding the traditional culture, so the international business culture is also appealing to me. The least favored job offers for me are those that require full-time work in the office."

During improving my knowledge of data analysis I’ve made several personal projects:

- AdCampaigns analytical overview:
The project focuses on analyzing advertising campaigns from Google and Facebook. To combine the data from several sources it was used various functions and operations in GoogleBigQuery such as CTE, join and union of tables as well as aggregation. Leveraging SQL and Looker Studio, this project extracts and analyzes data to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of ads. It includes metrics like spend, impressions, clicks, CPC, CPM, CTR, ROMI and their monthly distribution.

- Revenue analytical overview:
The visualization was made in Tableau and shows the main information about the revenue distribution in terms of products, locations, users, and periods. There is a box plot showing the main statistical measures of revenue such as minimal, maximal amount and median values for each region. This project helps to assess the Company’s sales and identify its weakness and growth. 

- Games metrics overview:
An analytical dashboard shows product metrics such as monthly average time per user, distribution of spent time among age bins, shares of users in battle pass activity. It helps to understand the groups of our target audience and define the most loyal to product users. An aggregation of data was made using calculated fields (string, date, type conversion, logical, aggregation functions), LOD expressions, quick table calculations in Tableau.
Seeking opportunities to join the friendly and open minded team to work on exciting and chalenging projects. As a Data analyst I want to make a meaningful impact to the Company growth and develop my skills and knowledge surrounded by the team of professionals."

data analyst,"Throughout my academic journey and practical experiences, I have amassed notable accomplishments that highlight my dedication, problem-solving abilities, and analytical prowess in the field of data analysis.
One of my most significant achievements was during my final year project, where I led a team of fellow students in developing a predictive analytics model for a healthcare organization. Recognizing the criticality of reducing hospital readmissions, we utilized classification algorithms to identify high-risk patients who were more likely to be readmitted. By integrating patient demographics, medical history, and social determinants of health, our model achieved an accuracy rate of 85%, aiding healthcare providers in implementing proactive interventions and reducing healthcare costs.
Throughout my academic journey and practical experiences, I have gained expertise in various aspects of data analysis, including classification, clustering, regression, data mining, and deep learning using TensorFlow.
I possess a good command of SQL and have utilized it extensively to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from relational databases. 
In addition to my technical skills, I have a foundation in algorithms and data structures. Through coursework and personal projects, I have developed a deep understanding of fundamental algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work collaboratively in diverse team settings during my academic projects. These experiences have honed my communication and teamwork skills, allowing me to effectively contribute to group discussions, share insights, and work towards common goals. Moreover, I have demonstrated my ability to work independently by successfully completing several data analysis projects on my own.
As I contemplate my future career as a data analyst, I have certain expectations and aspirations that I hope to fulfill in my professional journey. In seeking my first job as a junior data analyst, I am excited to contribute the knowledge and skills I have already acquired while also embarking on a path of continuous learning and growth to become a specialist in my field.
Furthermore, I have a strong desire to expand my experience and expertise in the field of data analysis. I am enthusiastic about working with seasoned professionals who can guide and mentor me, allowing me to learn from their expertise and gain insights into best practices.
In addition, I hope to be part of a team that encourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and open communication. By working in a supportive and collaborative environment, I believe I can make valuable contributions while also benefiting from the collective expertise of my colleagues. 
However, what I do not want is to be confined to monotonous or repetitive tasks that do not allow for personal growth and intellectual stimulation. While I understand that certain routine tasks are integral to the data analysis process, I am looking for a position that offers a balance between foundational responsibilities and opportunities for exploration and innovation. I believe that a diverse and stimulating workload is crucial in keeping me motivated and allowing me to develop as a professional."

I had experience in developing different types of chatbots, such as Linear Chat Bot, NLP Chat Bot and ML Chat Bot during my university internship at Samsung R&D Institute Ukraine(SRK). To achieve our goals, we worked in Python and used tools and libraries such as: PyGithub, Stanford NLP, LiberAI/NSpM, DBpedia, and SPARQL queries.
From July 1 to September 30, 2022,I was an intern at SoftServe and worked in Database Development direction. 
During the internship, we worked according to the SCRUM methodology, so I had the opportunity to try myself as a ScrumMaster for our team for a while. We held daily stand-up meetings, created tasks and subtasks and updated their status in Jira and documented the work in Confluence. During this time I gained experience in creating databases in MS SQL Server, creating stored procedures, functions, views, triggers and working with different types of data. I generated random data for our database using stored procedures. I also got acquainted with the ETL and Data Warehousing process and created an SSIS package in Visual Studio. At the last stage of the training, I made an ABC analysis of our product sales in SQL, transferred this report also to SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and made several dashboards and visualized cohort analysis in PowerBI.

data analyst,"One notable project I led was the analysis and optimization of a key game feature. Through extensive analysis and implementation of insights, I improved the pricing policy and designed intuitive dashboards to track key performance indicators. As a result, we achieved a 15% increase in revenue and stabilized the feature's performance over five iterations.

I have also worked closely with the Localization and Support teams to enhance and accelerate dashboards using SQL and Tableau. This collaboration resulted in improved workability and convenience for team members, enabling them to make data-driven decisions more effectively.

Furthermore, I developed over 10 SQL-based alerts using a proprietary tool to monitor the purchasing behavior of top spenders. This initiative led to more considerate and attentive player support, timely attention to player needs, and a reduction in churn.
In my previous role as a Junior Product Analyst in the mobile gaming field, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and tasks that have allowed me to utilize my skills in data analysis, SQL, Tableau, and my understanding of the gaming industry. I have been actively involved in collaborating with the LiveOps team, providing in-depth analysis of in-game event participation and players' purchasing behaviour. This analysis has generated actionable insights and recommendations to improve player engagement and revenue.

I have effectively utilized SQL and Tableau to create complex queries, design visually appealing dashboards, and present comprehensive reports. Additionally, my adaptability, teamwork, proactivity, problem-solving skills, and strong communication abilities have allowed me to work collaboratively with other departments and effectively communicate complex data to non-technical stakeholders.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue growing in my role as a Product Analyst, honing my analytical skills, and expanding my knowledge of Python and other analytical products to apply it to real-life projects. I aspire to contribute to the development of innovative data-driven product or service. Additionally, I am keen on leveraging my multilingual abilities to effectively collaborate with international teams and users.

By ""cleaning"" the data and conforming a large part of it to a unified system we were able to extract user insights that were previously underserved. On top of that we are creating a KPI system to measure optimal use of content.
Result: Phase 1 of the project, which includes:
 documentation of analytics for more than 1000 user flows,
 QA testing,
 100+ bug reporting and fixing,
 the new PRD setup for missing events.

Jan 2020- Nov 2021- Monetization Data Science Team Lead, Picsart
Project: Picsart Formula
Challenge: The GEM (grow, engage, monetize) formula had become stale and outdated and required a revamp. As the monetization data science team lead I was responsible to manage the entire project to restructure the KPI system for growth, engagement and monetization. Summary: The approach we took was purely data driven. We were able to measure the impact of each component of the formula (growth, engagement and monetization) on revenue. Tying in revenue impact as the key metric for each of the business units was crucial to the project's success.
Result: As a result the “butterfly effect” took hold and each unit better understood their impact of total revenue. Collaboration between revenue driving teams became frictionless. The quarter after the implementation of the new Picsart Formula our revenue grew by 10%.

Project: Monetization Dashboards
Challenge: Having multiple data sources and multiple teams working off of monetization data streams was extremely messy. There was a need for a unified data structure and managerial reporting.
Summary: Back in the days the business model was different and there was a separate Tableau dashboard for each Monetization KPI. As the company grew, there was a need to create an all in one dashboard that would be developed with a logic chain, and migrate from Tableau to Looker. Initially we worked with backend developers to clean the data and fix the bugs, then did some code/job adjustments.
Result: In a 6 months period we achieved a unified dashboard for all Monetization KPIs.
I have spent most of my professional life at Picsart (a high flying unicorn) overseeing a team that deep dives into data, translates those data points into insights and collaborates with different business units to implement strategies and tactics based on those insights. 
Although Picsart is very close to my heart but it's time to make a step to new challenges by gaining new skills and experience that will help me in my career advancement."

I currently make up the entire art of speaking the language of data: from mining data for meaningful insights,  to creating impactful data visualizations, to immersive storytelling, to driving action with data-driven decisions, to creating stunning communications that will leave a lasting impression on an audience and get results.

Some highlights:

1. Built reporting infrastructure. I built out and improved the data analysis and reporting infrastructure from ground up to provide real-time insights into the project KPIs. The process covered all stages of  analyzing 20+ projects for preparing KPI list, detecting anomalies by using SQL, consulting different levels of management with data related challenges, collaborating with stakeholders on metrics standardization, leading a team for creating 100+ Tableau dashboards (and some Superset reports), conducting user acceptance tests and presenting final outputs to stakeholders with Tableau Server. 

2. Automated 90% of periodic project performance reporting. With the team, we prepared comparison dashboards and presented them with insights and predictions, periodically. For finding reasons behind increase/decrease and offering solutions to challenges, we followed market, project development plan, project challenges and etc.

3. Helped different levels of management for data driven decision making. Examples: 
How to increase the number of registered users? Were current campaigns effective?  How did the COVID-19 pandemic effect the systems? Different tools (SQL, SPSS statistics, Python, Tableau) and wide range of data both inside and outside organization were used. 

4. Helped 3+cross-functional departments to implement data analysis, to drive insights and consulted them on data mining technics.

5. Tried making society more data driven. As a trainer guided 200+ data enthusiasts turn into job ready data analysts. Founded education company to inspire school children to explore magical world of data science. And to propagate importance of bringing data to life, I delivered several speeches and participated in TV and radio programs.
