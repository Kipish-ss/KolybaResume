hr,"I'm working in HR since 2007.
Throughout my professional experience I’ve had a chance to deal both with operational and strategic types of work.
Working at my first IT companies I had a role of HR Generalist and was in charge of all HR processes. I’ve acted more like Administrative Expert with executing recruiting, onboarding and adaptation, professional development, termination procedures. That type of work gave me general IT background and experience working with different stakeholders.
During my later working history I also was in charge of Lviv office regarding Talent Management practices. The main achievement while working there was keeping very low attrition level (during 2012-2013 the yearly attrition rate for Lviv location was about 5-7%). It was reached by forming favorable conditions and acting more in the role of Employee Champion by being close to people and their management.
In my next company (1500+ people) I could feel how quickly organization can grow, how fast environment and demands can change and how rapidly internal processes needed re-think and transformation. As HR manager I worked in the areas of retention and onboarding. I’ve provided global initiative Onboarding for Newcomers with the C-level participants. Also I’ve developed a framework for working with Employee’s Satisfaction metric.
After being promoted to Head of People Partnership, I became responsible for the number of strategic initiatives and processes connected to Talents Retention. I’ve re-designed Company’s termination process in order to make it more data oriented. Data Driven approach is one more thing that I’ve tightly worked with in the scope of Employee Experience unit. We provided full Analytics for almost all HR processes (Onboarding, Employee risks evaluation, Employee Satisfaction, Attrition, Termination etc). I’ve designed and implemented the project related to Retention cases management that helps all stakeholders to effectively work with Employees in a high-risk zone in order to retain them. Besides I have tightly worked with Senior Managers being a strategic partner and a change agent for providing different kinds of changes and audit existing processes.
Additionally to that I was managing the team of People Partners and that experience helps me to gain my knowledge of people management practices. It was a team of 14 People Partners in 4 locations.
Currently, I'm working as HRD and is responsible for all HR strategic initiatives and projects in the company
- design and implementation of Employee Attrition Risks project
- termination procedure redesign
- People Partners team managing, growth and development (from 0 to 14 employees in 4 UA locations)
- Providing Data Driven Approach within HR function
- full digitalization of recruiting and onboarding processes
I like my future engagements would be in the scope of HR strategy and talent programs development.
Working with strategic initiatives with close collaboration with business stakeholders are those things I would like to deal with."
