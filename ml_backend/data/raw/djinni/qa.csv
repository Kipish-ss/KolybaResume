qa,"A software tester who is not afraid of challenges and will always find a bug - here you go!) Finding bugs is my hobby, passion, and love)). When I'm not testing programs, I'm looking for bugs in my own code and have come to the conclusion that many problems can be solved (avoided) by friendly communication and mutual support. I organized a volunteer movement in my current location, established connections with public organizations and government agencies. My IT project, which I was fascinated by, is coming to an end, so now I am looking for a job where I can test the programs, skills and knowledge I have acquired.
Thanks to my meticulousness and attention to detail, I found bugs that were questioned by the developers and not reproduced by other testers. I was able to convince them and insist on the importance of fixing these bugs. As a result of a more detailed study of the problem with ""implicit"" bugs, 15 more errors were found that could lead to problems in the future and were difficult to see at first glance. This significantly shortened the product testing period.
I dream of joining a friendly and creative team.I am looking for a project where I can improve my software skills and collaborate with colleagues who share my motivation and passion for work."

1. Onboarding process: suggested improvements and updated the onboarding smoke checklist to streamline the onboarding process, enabling newcomers to get to know the product faster with minimal supervision.
2. Estimation: implemented a new approach - PERT with confidence level and more detailed decomposition. This has led to a more realistic understanding of the time and resources required for testing, that all of the necessary items are being considered and has helped to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
3. Smoke testing: documented a unified smoke testing approach, that helped the test team to understand its goals, when to perform it, and what checks to include to reduce time and improve effectiveness of smoke testing.
4. Regression testing: optimized the regression testing scope by combining tests for effective testing. This helped to reduce the number of redundant tests, and to decrease the time required for regression testing.
Initiated the definition of business criticality by Product Owner to prioritize checks in regression testing from a business perspective.
5. Requirements: implemented early-stage requirements testing by the testing team prior to development.
This involved introducing a new test activities structure that incorporated a requirements testing phase.
- Test activities structure led to improved planning analysis, visibility into the test phases and what those phases include. It also helped to track the time spent on tasks and analyze the accuracy of estimates.
- Requirements testing has led to a decrease in the scope of some features, preventing possible bugs before the development stage, reducing the amount of bugs, root cause of which are requirements.
6. Analytics: analyzed what approaches and algorithms were needed for the environment we were going to integrate with to get all the data we needed, and I developed a strategy for test data preparation in advance, also a method of how to maintain it. I created test data in a timeframe and with a quality that allowed me to obtain data that was not available before.
