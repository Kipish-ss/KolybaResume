flutter,"At the moment, I have more than 2.5 years of experience in Android/iOS development. Previously, I used to exclusively work on commerce projects and freelanced. From a simple activity tracker to complex computing applications. Mini games, educational and examination applications e.t.c.
I recently developed a game based on the board game ""Um, Actually"". It was necessary to create an interface where the entire Text was displayed, and by clicking on a specific word, the system had to determine whether that word was redundant or not.
Also, I developed an application for learning English. Specifically, an application consisting of simple tests, tasks with filling in the blank fields, choosing options in order, and an exam. The application consisted of several levels, each of which had different types of tasks and interfaces. There were many fill-in-the-blank tasks, each with a different number of blanks. It was also necessary to detect each empty field separately.
I confidently use state managers such as BloC and Provider, packages Dio/Freezed, Sqflite, SharedPreferencess.
I want to improve team skills."

flutter,"I’m a passionate and results-driven Frontend Developer with strong production experience in React, React Native, and Flutter.
I’ve been building responsive, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces across both web and mobile platforms, helping startups and established businesses bring their ideas to life.
I started with multi-page websites and landing pages for various clients, which helped me develop a solid understanding of frontend fundamentals and UI/UX design principles. Over time, I realized that static HTML/CSS no longer challenged me. That’s when I discovered the power of JavaScript frameworks, particularly React.js.
After mastering React, I quickly picked up React Native, expecting it to be the same — and while JSX is familiar, building mobile apps introduced new architecture patterns and performance considerations. I’ve since delivered several commercial apps using React Native and contributed to startup projects with clean, maintainable React codebases.
I also explored Flutter, appreciating its performance and flexibility for cross-platform development, and completed several mobile apps with it as well.

flutter,"1. An application for scanning documents, the following functions are available in the application:
- authorization by QR code
- photographing a document, detecting edges and transforming (OpenGL)
- document editing (rotate, contrast, white point, crop with edges auto detection/ manual shape edit)
- rearrangement of documents using drag&drop
- uploading documents to the company server
I am especially pleased:
- fixed a bug from another developer, which was related to detecting edges and updating the cached image in the ui:  the application specification required a one-time image cropp. Sometimes a bug was reproduced, due to which the scanned page could be saved as a white image. A couple of months later, a new technical specification arrived, in which it was necessary to add support for multiple cropp, and this problem arose every time.
- optimized the work of the overlay edit panel (removed input lag and freezes)
- added the ability to edit auto-detected edges on a document (trigonometry again). It took remake almost half of the already implemented features

flutter,"I am a Software Developer with over 6 years of experience in IT, specializing in Dart/Flutter and Java.
Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Swift and Python, both of which I have already used in production environments.
I possess a solid understanding and practical experience in full lifecycle development, continuous integration (CI), and the maintenance of complex projects. My applications are built on Flutter with back ends utilizing serverless solutions like Firebase, Supabase, and PocketBase, as well as complex infrastructures deployed on Kubernetes in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
I also have experience in lead and mentor roles, demonstrating a strong grasp of SOLID principles and design patterns. My relevant skills include CI, DevOps, and AI.
I began my career as a Java developer, building numerous microservices using Spring Boot and Rapidoid for back-end development. Most of these services feature REST APIs and interact with technologies such as PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Redis, Solr, Pub/Sub, Kafka, and Spark.
I have been working with Flutter since 2018, amassing about 5 years of expertise. I started in a small company where there were limited Java tasks but ample opportunities for developing MVPs of mobile applications with Flutter. My passion for Flutter drove me to focus on mobile development, and I am eager to spend more time creating mobile applications than working on back-end services.
I have experience in project development from the ground up, including requirements analysis, architecture establishment, risk minimization, and development time estimation.
I have worked on a variety of projects, including a social network, healthcare app, language learning app, travel app, restaurant app, IoT app for controlling billboards, CRM app, and a marketplace app for students, among others.
Notably, I contributed to several significant projects, including the geolocation-based social network ""PLESION,"" the innovative healthcare application ""HeadacheCalendar,"" and the travel app ""Circuit Secret."" These projects have been published on both the Play Store and Apple Store, where they remain available for users.
It would be great to work on interesting project.

flutter,"I've completed several educational and entertainment applications. My list contains applications not for only smartphones, but for smart tvs too. I've used flutter framework  all the time and used swift sometimes when I needed the native feature, but I don't know swift that cool. Most of my apps are made on cubit state management. I used bloc, but not much, because it slows down the process and there is an alternative which was built on bloc which is way more easier to use and that's cubit.
For network, I use Dio, I love its interceptor ability. I used retrofit, but I switched to dio after I've made a very comfortable network service myself which depends on dio.
I use clean architecture as an architecture, I always try to separate the code and make it simple and readable. I've read S.O.L.I.D. principles and I try to use it in my projects.
I know Isolate, but I only used it for background processing.
Some of my apps, now have a well user-base.

flutter,"Independently developed applications for 30+ screens, designed application architecture and relationships. Used GraphQL to communicate with the backend, but sometimes REST. There is experience in working with Google ML, for example, recognizing QR codes. Worked with Google Maps, Open Street maps, and developed chats on Socket.IO. I can immediately lay the possibility of scaling the application, as well as adding several themes.
Developed 7 commercial applications, the domains of which are: e-commerce, health, corporate applications, dating, and education. Based on the experience gained, I developed my template, which includes localization, working with storage, and databases, changing the design theme, working with the Intern, et and much more. I always stick to deadlines and often still have 30% extra time.
My expectations:
Ability to work on complex and interesting projects
Ability to work with innovative technologies.
The opportunity to work in a team of talented and dedicated developers.
Opportunity to learn and develop.
Here's what I don't want to do:
Working on projects that are not interesting to me.
Working in a team that does not encourage creativity and cooperation.
Working in a company that does not strive to create innovative and quality products."

Flutter Dev since 2018.
Full Stack C#.NET since 2011.
I frequently use Firebase, Appwrite, or Supabase when a backend is needed. I use BaaS to save time on development, avoid reinventing the wheel, use the established stability and performance, etc.
Lead the development of a mobile application (Android and iOS) with a team of developers and launched successfully early this year with over a million downloads so far. Before that - cut costs of a nonprofit that onboarded me by over 80% and tracked down encoded malicious code hidden semi dormant in the codebase. I architect, develop, oversee, and maintain the entire stack from the ground up all the way to production.

Finger Sizer: Це додаток для вимірювання розміру кільця з використанням AR. Я займався дослідженнями для покращення користувацького досвіду та реалізацією нових функцій.
Моя роль у команді:
У команді я активно беру участь у код-рев'ю, дотримуюсь найкращих практик для забезпечення високої якості коду. Я намагаюсь бути командним гравцем, який заохочує обмін ідеями та співпрацю.
Перспективи розвитку:
Я планую продовжувати розвиватися у напрямку крос-платформної розробки, поглиблюючи знання у Flutter та вивчаючи нові технології, пов'язані зі штучним інтелектом та машинним навчанням. Моя мета - стати експертом у цих технологіях і впроваджувати їх у практичні рішення, які роблять життя користувачів комфортнішим і функціональнішим.

flutter,"I have been using Swift to develop iOS applications since 2015. My career began in the banking sector, where I worked on a secure P2P transfer app.
Following that, I gained experience creating applications for aggregating sports news and analytics, as well as providing real-time Text broadcasts of sporting events.
Later, I joined a startup, where I developed an iOS client for a social networking platform that featured voting systems and personal ratings.
After that, I was fortunate to work with a major retail chain, where I created an application that allows users to conveniently pay for purchases using QR codes integrated with an international payment system, manage receipts, view promotional information, earn loyalty rewards, and place online orders for home delivery. This app significantly reduced wait times and queues, effectively increasing customer throughput across the entire supermarket network. I wrote this application from scratch and later led a team of iOS developers as the team grew. I remain grateful for the opportunity and invaluable experience I gained. The app now boasts several million downloads and consistently ranks among the top downloaded applications in the Ukrainian App Store.
Subsequently, I moved to a British startup focused on developing a travel application. It bears functional similarities to TripAdvisor or Google Map Reviews but significantly expands on original ideas in the realm of social communication.
My next position was also with a startup, centered on social connections, where users can seek new acquaintances based on shared interests and hobbies. Unlike my previous experiences, I worked on the backend for this project, utilizing Golang. I organized Docker management with microservices, set up CI/CD, and established a private container registry using self-hosted GitLab.
My most recent project involved developing a casual card game for both Android and iOS.
I used Flutter, allowing for a unified codebase across multiple platforms. Unlike many similar games in the App Store and Google Play, this application features a unique function that no one else currently offers. In this card game, users can customize the face of any card with photos from their media library, creating a unique deck using images of friends, family, and celebrities. Themed sets can be made based solely on one’s imagination. Through this project, I also enhanced my skill set by working with paid subscriptions on both platforms and integrating AdMob ads
- Developed an application for a major retailer, achieving over one million downloads. It was the first in Eastern Europe to integrate QR payment with MasterPass Wallet.
- Experienced in configuring GitLab CI/CD and Docker deployment and orchestration.
I'm looking to work on a challenging and engaging project that will help me enhance my technical skills while allowing me to make a valuable contribution to the organization's success. I'm seeking a role where I can have a positive impact and continuously grow as a developer."

Під час роботи над цими проектами я використовував різноманітні технології разом із Flutter. Наприклад, Firebase для хмарного зберігання даних, аутентифікації та управління сесіями користувачів, HTTP-запити для взаємодії з зовнішніми API, SQLite для локального зберігання даних та багато інших.
У деяких проектах я був відповідальним за архітектуру додатку, включаючи розробку гнучких та масштабованих архітектурних шаблонів, таких як BLoC (Business Logic Component) або Provider, для забезпечення ефективного керування станом та розділення рівнів додатка.
Зараз я працюю в команді мобільної розробки як розробник Flutter. Моя роль включає в себе розробку нових функцій, оптимізацію продуктивності, виправлення помилок та участь у процесі обговорення та прийняття рішень з технологічних питань.

flutter,"Ive been working as Flutter developer for 4+ years. Through this period of time I`ve built  several applications, mostly for European market.
1. One of the biggest was  Price comparison App. The project was built from scratch and was designed to get the best price for a desired product. My part was communicating with the clients team (backend dev and pm ) and implementing functionality and ui requirements.
The app used such features as:
- Provider state management solution,
- Email and Social logins,
- Clustered google maps,
- FCM push notifications,
- Various kinds of charts and graphs
- Various kinds of slivers
2. Another interesting app was Astrology forecast application designed to give users different kinds of astrology predictions.    Despite not a big number of pages it carried such technologies:
- Bloc state management
- Different kinds of charts grouped by months and years
- Consumable  Inapp Purchases and Subscriptions
3. I've also took part in building/ fixing an app for European University. The case was the following. The client came with a self designed app for teachers and students where students had to take exams remotely. They need to record they answers  in video and audio format and send it to the teachers.
Originally the app was buggy as all the code was written in one file without any state management solution. I had to refactor the architecture and applied Provider to organise business logic. Ive applied flutter plugin for automatic microphone enabling in the background(was one of the clients requirements) and added a time tracker for each exam.
4. One more project was for different kinds of summits, where users could register with Email or phone number, communicate with each other, create meetings for a certain date and get push notifications. The stack was the following
- Firebase/Firestore,
- FCM notifications
- Remote config
- Firebase Crashlytics, etc.
5. There are several more projects i've worked on. Currently Im diving in generative AI engineering, and learning about Large Language Models. Im working on prompt engineering, installing LLMs locally and creating servers to reach data. So far ive created several chat apps with Ai backend both from ChatGpt API and local like Ollama, LM studio and Genkit.

flutter,"Я маю багатий досвід у розробці програмного забезпечення, працюючи над різними проєктами, зокрема: e-learning платформи, онлайн магазини, додатки для пристроїв безпеки, проєкти з AI та додатки для знайомств. Мої завдання включали розробку мобільних, десктопних і веб застосунків на Flutter, а також розробку бекенду на Kotlin (Spring Boot) і Python (Flask). Додатково, я займався менторством, інтеграцією CI/CD, тестуванням, аналізом, написанням unit та integration тестів.
Для реалізації цих проєктів я використовую широкий набір технологій, серед яких Flutter, Dart, Swift, SwiftUI, Python, Flask, Kotlin і Spring Boot. У проєктах, що відповідають моєму стеку технологій, я, як правило, займаю роль техліда та головного розробника.
Зараз я фокусуюсь на підвищенні продуктивності та якості розробки, прагнучи створювати красиві та швидкі застосунки з меншими витратами часу.
Ефективність релізів: Як головний розробник, я забезпечив стабільний вихід кожного проєкту без затримок і критичних багів, навіть у масштабних розробках. Завдяки прозорим робочим процесам та організованій документації, процес розробки був максимально зрозумілим для замовника та команди.
Оптимізація та архітектура: На проєктах з високими вимогами до швидкодії та складними UI, які потребували частого оновлення, я створював ефективну архітектуру та оптимізував продуктивність, що значно підвищило стабільність і швидкість роботи застосунків.
Лідерство: Моя робота як техліда отримувала позитивні відгуки від команди, створюючи мотиваційне середовище, де кожен був зацікавлений у співпраці. Це допомагало досягати високих результатів при збереженні робочої атмосфери та згуртованості команди.
Швидкість і якість: На одному з проєктів, де я був єдиним мобільним розробником, вдалося успішно завершити розробку за 3 місяці, хоча інші оцінки були 5+ місяців. Завдяки цьому застосунок швидко набув популярності, зібравши понад 100,000 завантажень лише за перші 10 днів після релізу, що свідчить про його стабільність та високу якість.
Я очікую стабільності та конкурентної заробітної плати, яка відповідатиме рівню моєї експертизи й досвіду. Бажаю працювати в середовищі з постійним завантаженням проєктами, де є можливість зосередитися на конкретних задачах без перебування на ""бенчі"". Важливими є також мотивована команда та гнучкі процеси, що дозволяють налаштувати робочий ритм для максимальної ефективності."

flutter,"I'm not saying this to make you feel sorry for me, I just want to explain. I've been looking for a job for so long, and I'm really keen to work. I need a job to go to Thailand for my education.
I'm really interested in working with Flutter, and I'm open to any position. I want to start working as soon as possible."
flutter,"Релевантний досвід:
Мій комерційний досвід поки що обмежується стажуванням у компанії Flai Analytics. Моєю основною задачею було самостійно розробити мобільний застосунок із нуля:
- спроєктувати та налаштувати базу даних,
- створити сервер для REST API,
- розробити клієнтський інтерфейс.
До цього, на початку повномасштабного вторгнення, я почав вивчати Python і SQL через онлайн-курси, але з часом переключився на Java. Пройшов навчання в Epam Campus, після чого вирішив спробувати себе в мобільній розробці на Flutter. Це й привело мене до стажування у Flai Analytics.
Окрім цього, самостійно працював над pet-проєктами, де:
- написав програму Розумна підписка  - підписується на людину в соц мережі, якщо вона не відповідає взаємністю через певний період то людина додається в чорний список і від неї автоматично відписуються (Python + Selenium, свого часу мені потрібно було підняти кількість підписників в соц мережі),
- написав базовий голосовий помічник для Windows (розпізнає голос, вмикає, вимикає компʼютер, відкриває названні застосунки),
- розробляв легкі сервери на Python Django,
- виконував тестові завдання від компаній Ajax та InForce (тестування через Apium та ETL pipeline).
Прагну розвиватися у напрямку мобільної розробки та бекенду.
Нерелевантний досвід:
Розпочав кар'єру на сімейному підприємстві з міжнародних вантажних перевезень, де пройшов шлях від вантажника та слюсаря до молодшого механіка, а згодом — заступника директора.
Мої обов’язки включали:
закупівлю та облік ремонтних запчастин,
системне адміністрування (оновлення конфігурацій 1С, створення резервних копій бази даних, оновлення ПЗ, вирішення hardware/software проблем),
роботу з первинною документацією,
участь у тендерах та пошук заявок на Ларді Транс,
координацію ремонтів вантажівок (DAF XF 105).
У підлітковому віці працював копірайтером для трьох видань:
будівельного блогу,
онлайн-журналу про життя та технології,
одеського магазину електроніки QWERTY Shop.
Також у певний період поєднував роботу в сімейному бізнесі з роботою в мережі магазинів Траш.
Після звільнення пробував себе в різних сферах: працював експедитором та customer support у американській компанії.
Горджуся тим, що зміг самостійно створити мобільний застосунок майже без зовнішньої підтримки, а також:
- самостійно навчився грати на піаніно,
- вступив на бюджет до найкращого коледжу свого міста,
- потрапив на стипендію,
- писав статті для сайту коледжу,
- у 20 років власноруч збудував фронтон будинку (15 кв. м, на висоті 9 м).
Хоч ці пункти і не стосуються напряму IT, демонструють мою здатність до самостійного навчання та досягнення цілей.
Я усвідомлюю, що для сучасного IT-ринку в Україні мій досвід ще недостатній, тому шукаю компанію, де зможу себе проявити та розвиватися як спеціаліст.
Мені важлива:
можливість навчання та професійного росту,
команда, з якою приємно працювати,
чітка організація процесів.
Після досвіду роботи в сімейному бізнесі для мене must-have – це прозорі робочі процеси та стабільність. Не хотів би опинитися в ситуації, коли робочий графік хаотичний: то немає роботи по кілька днів, то доводиться працювати без вихідних.
Буду радий знайти компанію, де мої навички та прагнення до розвитку будуть цінуватися!"

In my role as a software engineer, a big win for me was switching our retail app from React Native to Flutter. It was a tough job that needed me to understand both technologies well and learn fast.
Using my Flutter skills, I found ways to make the app better and faster. The switch to Flutter went smoothly, and the new version of the app is not only more efficient but also easier to take care of.
Moving an app from one tech to another is tricky, and I'm proud of doing it well. It shows I know my stuff as a software engineer and can quickly pick up on new technologies.
