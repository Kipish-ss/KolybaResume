c++,"Projects: Windows Utility Applications
Product-oriented development of performance and system optimization tools for Windows. All apps were built from scratch using modern C++ (C++17/20) and cross-platform Sciter UI. Actively contributed to core feature design, optimization
Technologies: C++, Sciter Reactor, Python, Steam API, GPU/CPU/RAM overclocking modules, WinAPI, SQLite, Git, JSON, CI/CD pipelines
PC Cleaner – System Cleanup & Registry Optimizer
A utility tool for cleaning residual files, optimizing the registry, disabling unneeded startup items, and improving overall system responsiveness.
Responsibilities:
- Designed and implemented scanning engine for detecting junk files, invalid registry entries, and unneeded temp data.
- Refactored file scanning logic to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
- Created cleanup rules and exclusion filters for sensitive system areas.
- - Built Python automation scripts to simplify workflows (e.g. repo synchronization, projects template generation, localization).
Impact: Improved scan time by 2–10×; product successfully released and contributes to millions in annual revenue.
Driver Updater – Driver Management Tool
Scans the system for outdated or missing drivers and updates them from a driver repository.
Responsibilities:
- Conducted competitor analysis through reverse engineering to understand market features and strengths.
- Implemented logic for detecting hardware, matching drivers, and updating with user consent.
Game Buff – Game Performance Booster
A desktop tool focused on improving gaming experience by freeing resources and optimizing hardware usage.
Responsibilities:
- Implemented features for safe overclocking of CPU and GPU.
- Improved RAM cleaning functionality (5× efficiency improvement in memory freeing).
- Added “Task Optimization” system to suspend heavy background processes and resume them after gameplay.
- Integrated Steam API to fetch games list, check compatibility with system specs
One of my most notable achievements has been the automation of routine processes, which significantly improved my team’s efficiency. In particular, I developed Python scripts that reduced the time required for software localization from a full day to just about 30 minutes. I also managed to significantly enhance the performance of several features. For example, the effectiveness of the RAM Boost feature in the Game Buff application improved approximately fivefold. Additionally, I optimized the scanning speed in the PC Cleaner utility, achieving performance increases ranging from 2x to 10x depending on the scenario. I created a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a driver scanner and updater and conducted reverse engineering of competitor products, which helped identify areas for improvement in our own solutions.
These contributions had a tangible impact on the success of the products and the development of the team. I directly contributed to the successful release and monetization of 2 products that have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the company. Additionally, I mentored new engineers, helping them onboard quickly and start contributing to the project productively
In my next role, I aim to join a team of proactive, honest, and professional individuals and contribute to modern projects that utilize up-to-date technologies. A flexible work schedule and a transparent system for regular salary reviews are very important to me.
At the same time, I would like to avoid working with outdated legacy code or in a toxic team environment. Repetitive, monotonous tasks are not a good fit for me. I also strongly oppose excessive control practices, such as activity trackers that take screenshots or monitor mouse movements, as I believe trust and autonomy are key components of productive work."

The main platform is Linux.
The quality of my code can be verified on many of my open-source projects, some of which are about fifteen years old. (see my GitHub profile).
I have experience in developing all kinds of servers and application layer protocols, MMO projects (servers/partly_game_logic/RMI/RPC/IPC/replication), high-speed trading, game bots, mining optimization, distributed mining, profiling and application optimization, cryptography (symmetric/asymmetric, key exchanging/derivation/revocation), video streaming, video processing, video multiplexing/de-multiplexing, v4l2, gstreamer, Mavlink, UAV, remote control system for UAV.
My technology stack:
- C/C++
- Cоde gеneration, PP-way, pre/post -way
- STL, boost, boost.asio, Qt, wxWidgets
- Networking, tcpdump, Valgrіnd/Callgrіnd
- RPC
- TCP/UDP

- UAV
- In 2010 I was the first to implement multi-threading support for MinGW-W64.
- In 2012 I implemented serialization for C++, which until recently was the fastest.
- In 2017 I added to that serialization the ability to ""construct"" objects for serialization, this became the basis for static reflection of objects, followed by serialization in JSON format. At the time it was the fastest zero-copy serialization of C++ objects as JSON.
- also in 2017 I was the author of the implementation for GCC compiler of std::filesystem support for Windows. (MinGW-W64)
- In 2013 I started working on a hobbyist task of an interface generator for RPC using only the C++ Preprocessor. (really! =)) The result was a self-contained RPC project (with client/server skeleton) that is now used by several companies.
- In 2019 I successfully implemented and integrated a UDP video stream demultiplexer for streaming video from a UAV over several GSM channels, with multiplexing on a server side for the company's field to cloud infrastructure.
- In 2021 I implemented a lossless UDP channel for video streaming, which became possible to use to send UAV control commands in both directions.

Starting with the REST API on lua, ending with the debugging of the wifi driver and the kernel in order to find the cause of the deadlock. Since it is an openwrt based system, the C language was used the most.
I am developing, both in networking and in any other areas that are interesting to me.
At 13, being in the 7th grade, I participated in the 11th grade Olympiad in IT technologies, taking 1st place for 2 years in a row.
I'm studying computer engineering and I'm in the top five of the best students according to the rating, despite the fact that I've already been working full-time on a commercial project for part of the time.
With no particular experience, I got into a new project that was in an active stage of development, where time played a very big role, so it was sometimes interesting (and usually not easy) to fix bugs that had veryyyy strict deadlines.

Designed an automatic watering system for the flowerbeds. As a programming language I used C++. The system was created on the basis of esp8266 microcontroller, also MQTT server was used. NodeRed & Blueprints/JavaScript was chosen for the user interface. The system supported connection of many controllers from any point that had access to WI-FI, as well as support for pump control, plant lighting.
Specifically now I am developing a submarine, based on microcontroller stm32g474ceu6, with ApisQueen motors, the developing own board in Kicad, and 3d project in Fusion 360.
I am looking forward to working on a real and interesting project with a strong team, getting to know more experienced people and gaining experience myself."

c) Ceph as a storage system,
d) Postgres and MongoDB as databases.

3) Current project. Continuous Integration and Development team. Creating CI test suits for residential gateways
During trainee training, I wrote on a C/C++ mix HTTPS server for Linux, a WiFi scanner for Linux OS, and a custom OpenWRT module for configuring SSH on the router.
On the first project, I worked with cable modems. Updated modules for it, implemented new features, like distinguishing speed of Ethernet port. Improved read/write mechanism when BadBlocks are present on the dedicated partition. Worked with WiFi Mesh extender. Fixed pairing problems after migration to the latest kernel.
The latest project work involves porting existing OpenWRT-based firmware to the OpenSource hardware platform BananaPI BPI-R3. Researching existing build systems, hardware-specific points, and boot systems. Created configuration for the new platform and investigated and updated image creation for the new platform.
Current project. Work as C/Python software engineer. Working on the implementation of API for automating the test of the hardware. In this case, we have equipment that is connected to the router and uses AT commands to communicate with it. Creating an API that allows the use of Python code to autotest this equipment."
