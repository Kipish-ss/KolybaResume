c++,"Currently, I am working on a temporary unpaid IoT project (a full monitoring system for refrigerators and more) for my friend’s father’s company, “Hlad Service.” I have implemented sensor data monitoring, local data storage on an SD card, and data transmission to a server via an ESP32 board with a built-in SIM800H module for GPRS connectivity. The ESP32 runs robust C++ code that accounts for challenges specific to Ukraine (such as power outages), RTC module startup issues, AT command instabilities, etc. On the server side, I developed the backend using Golang, with TimeScaleDB employed for storing time-series data. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in managing real-world projects and interacting with clients—understanding their needs, delivering tailored solutions, and developing viable alternatives when direct implementation wasn’t feasible.In terms of hard skills, I significantly improved my proficiency in C++ programming for microcontrollers, learned how to effectively work with controllers and modules (e.g., SPI, I2C), resolved conflicts between the SD card module and the SIM800 module, and deepened my understanding of AT commands for mobile internet connectivity. I also enhanced my knowledge of esp32 multithreading, Golang programming, and working with SQL/NoSQL databases like TimeScaleDB and Prometheus.
Worked as a Python and SQL programming tutor at a young coder school. This role provided extensive experience in explaining complex concepts in simple terms, communicating with people of all ages, and resolving interpersonal conflicts. Over the nine months I worked there, most of the children I taught developed a strong understanding of basic programming concepts, Python features, and the fundamentals of coding. This job greatly contributed to the development of my soft skills."

c++,"I have over 20 years of experience in developing different types of software - desktop, embedded, mobile, mainly safety, responsible, high-loaded, replicated applications for industry (Windows, Linux, QNX).
Main programming language: C++. Beginner-level in Python
The most valuable and interesting development for me was a ""programmable logic"" from my first job. It was a special program layer between a device's physical and logical inputs/outputs also included a top-level software for configuration. A top-level user had a possibility to  write some equations of dependency between physical an logical signals using logical elements AND, OR, XOR and timers and triggers. It provided great configuration flexibility and the user could create additional logic. Nobody believed that it was possible to integrate this feature to the device, but it was done and still works today 20 years later.
I would prefer a work schedule that is not too strict and not too many meetings. For example, in my current project, meetings take 3-4 hours 3 times a week, it’s too tiring."

c++,"I worked on two projects. The first was for my university assignment in databases. I worked in a team as a backend and, particularly, a frontend developer. Our idea was to create software to help lawyers with case management. My task was to create a functional UI (without styling, just the elements) and connect it with the API manager.
In the second project, our team developed software for small businesses. The main idea was to replace 1C and provide a user-friendly UI. For the most part, I was a backend developer and, in part, a frontend developer.
In both projects, I used C++ with the Qt framework. The build system was CMake, and version control was managed through Git/GitHub. In the last project, we used Linux.
I significantly improved my skills in C++ and the Qt framework, gaining a deeper understanding of Git and CMake. However, the most valuable achievements were the development of my teamwork, adaptability, and communication skills, which have proven essential in collaborative environments.
I expect to work on engaging C++ projects, preferably outside of embedded systems, where I can apply my knowledge in C++, Git, CMake, Make, and the Qt framework."

- In 2010 I was the first to implement multi-threading support for MinGW-W64.
- In 2012 I implemented serialization for C++, which until recently was the fastest.
- In 2017 I added to that serialization the ability to ""construct"" objects for serialization, this became the basis for static reflection of objects, followed by serialization in JSON format. At the time it was the fastest zero-copy serialization of C++ objects as JSON.
- also in 2017 I was the author of the implementation for GCC compiler of std::filesystem support for Windows. (MinGW-W64)
- In 2013 I started working on a hobbyist task of an interface generator for RPC using only the C++ Preprocessor. (really! =)) The result was a self-contained RPC project (with client/server skeleton) that is now used by several companies.
- In 2019 I successfully implemented and integrated a UDP video stream demultiplexer for streaming video from a UAV over several GSM channels, with multiplexing on a server side for the company's field to cloud infrastructure.
- In 2021 I implemented a lossless UDP channel for video streaming, which became possible to use to send UAV control commands in both directions.

One of my most notable achievements has been the automation of routine processes, which significantly improved my team’s efficiency. In particular, I developed Python scripts that reduced the time required for software localization from a full day to just about 30 minutes. I also managed to significantly enhance the performance of several features. For example, the effectiveness of the RAM Boost feature in the Game Buff application improved approximately fivefold. Additionally, I optimized the scanning speed in the PC Cleaner utility, achieving performance increases ranging from 2x to 10x depending on the scenario. I created a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a driver scanner and updater and conducted reverse engineering of competitor products, which helped identify areas for improvement in our own solutions.
These contributions had a tangible impact on the success of the products and the development of the team. I directly contributed to the successful release and monetization of 2 products that have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the company. Additionally, I mentored new engineers, helping them onboard quickly and start contributing to the project productively
In my next role, I aim to join a team of proactive, honest, and professional individuals and contribute to modern projects that utilize up-to-date technologies. A flexible work schedule and a transparent system for regular Salary reviews are very important to me.
At the same time, I would like to avoid working with outdated legacy code or in a toxic team environment. Repetitive, monotonous tasks are not a good fit for me. I also strongly oppose excessive control practices, such as activity trackers that take screenshots or monitor mouse movements, as I believe trust and autonomy are key components of productive work."

c++,"I'm Khachatur, a C/C++ developer with over 15 years of experience.
I have worked on several projects, primarily in C/C++. One of the key projects was the development of a financial application that collected data from various sources using multiple communication protocols. The system performed financial processing and communicated with different external hosts to ensure timely and accurate data exchange.
In another project focused on low-latency network traffic, I implemented a custom load balancer and developed a high-performance handler for processing real-time data received over the network. This involved working with protocols such as TCP/IP and UDP, using raw sockets, and implementing multithreaded data handling to ensure optimal performance and minimal latency.
Throughout these projects, I have extensively used technologies such as STL, Boost libraries, and multithreading. My current role involves designing and implementing core components, ensuring stability and reliability. I also collaborate closely with team members on architectural decisions and conduct code reviews.
Looking ahead, I am eager to further improve my skills in modern C++ (C++17/20/23)

Також я приділяю велику увагу алгоритмам та їхній ефективності. Я знайомий з класичними алгоритмами сортування, пошуку та структурами даних, такими як хеш-таблиці, черги та стеки. Це допомагає мені розробляти продуктивні рішення та оптимізувати роботу програм.
Я навчаюсь у Київському політехнічному університеті імені Ігоря Сікорського за спеціальністю 122 – ""Комп'ютерні науки"". Протягом навчання я активно розвиваю свої навички програмування та роботи з сучасними технологіями.
Я маю досвід роботи з мовами програмування C та C++. Мене цікавить розробка програмного забезпечення, і я вже працював із середовищем Qt, створюючи як графічні, так і консольні додатки. Окрім цього, я впевнено володію Git."

In 2017 I've joined an outsource company as as Middle C++ Engineer, promoted to Senior C++ Engineer in a few years. The project was one of the world's most famous video editing systems.
Initially I joined a team which was developing a microservices-based solution for distributed processing. I was mainly working on design and implementation of a microservice which performs highly loaded media processing operations (effects processing, reencoding, etc.).
Then I started to work on a media processing library, used in a number of client’s products. This was a huge piece of software, very complex and extremely multithreaded with a bunch of legacy code.
I took an active part in design and implementation of several new features: replacing obsolete IO libraries with a new plugin system, adding support for audio decode/encode, adding a new file export system, etc. I made the main work on the player side to support all this functionality, implemented a new IO subsystem, created several dialogs for related UI changes in the editor.

Do you believe that senior developers who can't pass coding interviews are incompetent? What is your argument for or against coding interviews?
I think the entire Software Engineering interview process is completely broken. When I hire, I throw the process on its head, and I have the candidate test me. I write the code, and we talk about it.
I have passed this technique on to others, and I have yet to hear of it failing anyone. This is often how development works in proper collaboratively driven environments, and if they are senior it is safe to say that with the right support, they can step up and perform well - given the right tools.
To directly answer the question, no, they are not incompetent. In fact, they might be great. When I used to do Coding Interviews, I found myself using it as a tool, and devaluing its value over time. I hired a staff level developer, after he flopped on the test, because his oral presentation of the problem and solution (minus code) was spot on. He went on to be one of my favorite developer humans of all time.
Some of my worst hires aced coding tests. In fact, thinking back, every dev I had to let go was great academically, but was just not a fit and could not collaborate - and incidentally often caused issues.
The code interview, hacker ranking, all of that is useful, but as low brow tooling, imo. I don’t mean to diminish them, but you need to be clear what you are looking for in the process and in a candidate.
Also, we are hiring people, not developers. If I hear a manger call a developer a “skillset” on more time, I am going to lose it."

c++,"У своїй діяльності я впевнено використовую C/C++ з глибокими знаннями ООП та STL, що дозволяє створювати оптимізовані програми. Маю досвід роботи з Qt, QML та JavaScript для розробки кросплатформних користувацьких інтерфейсів. Щоб набути практичних навичок розробив власний пет-проєкт ""Щоденник"".
Diary — універсальний щоденник, що об'єднує функціональність записника, планувальника та нагадувань. Головна мета проєкту — створити зручний та багатофункціональний інструмент для організації особистих справ, записів та подій.
Для реалізації проєкту я обрав C++ із використанням фреймворку Qt і QML для створення інтуїтивного інтерфейсу. Як базу даних для зберігання даних обрав SQLite, яка забезпечує надійне локальне збереження без складних налаштувань.
У рамках мого досвіду роботи з Windows API я розробив проект ""Науковий калькулятор"" — функціональний та ефективний інструмент для виконання різноманітних математичних обчислень. Цей калькулятор пропонує інтуїтивно зрозумілий інтерфейс, який забезпечує зручність використання для користувачів. Він підтримує широкий спектр функцій, включаючи тригонометричні та логарифмічні обчислення, а також дозволяє працювати з різними системами числення, що робить його ідеальним рішенням для студентів, інженерів та всіх, хто потребує потужного обчислювального інструменту.
У проєкті використовуються як динамічні, так і статичні бібліотеки, що дозволяє оптимізувати використання пам'яті та підвищити швидкість роботи програми. Використання Windows API надає можливість створювати адаптивний інтерфейс, обробляти події користувача та інтегрувати функціональність на низькому рівні.
