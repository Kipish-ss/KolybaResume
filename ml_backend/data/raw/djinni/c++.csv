- UAV
- In 2010 I was the first to implement multi-threading support for MinGW-W64.
- In 2012 I implemented serialization for C++, which until recently was the fastest.
- In 2017 I added to that serialization the ability to ""construct"" objects for serialization, this became the basis for static reflection of objects, followed by serialization in JSON format. At the time it was the fastest zero-copy serialization of C++ objects as JSON.
- also in 2017 I was the author of the implementation for GCC compiler of std::filesystem support for Windows. (MinGW-W64)
- In 2013 I started working on a hobbyist task of an interface generator for RPC using only the C++ Preprocessor. (really! =)) The result was a self-contained RPC project (with client/server skeleton) that is now used by several companies.
- In 2019 I successfully implemented and integrated a UDP video stream demultiplexer for streaming video from a UAV over several GSM channels, with multiplexing on a server side for the company's field to cloud infrastructure.
- In 2021 I implemented a lossless UDP channel for video streaming, which became possible to use to send UAV control commands in both directions.
