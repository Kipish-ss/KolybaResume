Developed a full-stack CRM application using Django as the backend and Nuxt.js as the frontend framework. This has given me some understanding of how applications are built, how to read code, and where to find relevant information when needed.
Played a key role in developing a dynamic Jenkins environment for multiple development teams. The main goal was to enable developers to create their own Jenkins instances with minimal effort and in the shortest time possible.
Developed an almost fully dynamic EKS environment for a client, with cost-efficiency as the primary goal. Spot instances (or, if unavailable, on-demand instances) were created, removed, and managed by a Karpenter Node Pool configured to provision the desired instance families. Pod allocation to these nodes was managed by a custom Kubernetes scheduler, which allocated pods to nodes with the highest resource usage, ensuring optimal resource utilization. Once the workload was completed, the instances were immediately terminated."

devops,"•	Migrated legacy CI/CD to GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
I replaced outdated Jenkins pipelines with GitOps-driven CI/CD processes, cutting down deployment time, increasing reliability, and reducing pipeline maintenance. I’ve worked closely with dev teams to introduce reusable, secure pipelines integrated with Docker builds, Kubernetes deployments, and IaC checks.
•	Optimized AWS usage to cut cloud costs by 35%
At one client, I helped bring their AWS bill down from $25,000/month to $16,000/month by switching to Graviton processors, spot instances, reserved capacity for RDS and ElastiCache, and right-sizing EC2 workloads — all while maintaining availability and performance.
•	Built automated infrastructure with Terraform & Terragrunt
Using Terraform and Terragrunt, I designed modular infrastructure stacks for staging and production environments. I implemented reusable patterns, enforced environment consistency, and used Atlantis to fully automate pull request–based deployments, disabling direct AWS access for engineers.
•	Designed disaster recovery and high availability strategies
I implemented cross-region backup, replication, and failover policies for business-critical systems. This included testing recovery procedures and setting up monitoring to ensure systems could handle failure scenarios gracefully.
•	Managed container workloads with Kubernetes & Helm
I’ve deployed and maintained microservices on Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts, handling configuration, autoscaling, and rolling updates. I also integrated deployments with GitLab CI and used Prometheus/Grafana to track performance and cluster health.
•	Established full-stack observability
I set up and maintained real-time monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and OpenSearch. These tools gave dev and ops teams deep visibility into their systems, speeding up incident response and enabling proactive troubleshooting.
I am a young, highly motivated DevOps engineer with a solid background in cloud technologies and a desire for ongoing learning. I started working as a DevOps at age 17. I have achieved 7 AWS, 1 Azure, and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

Last project
The main task was to migrate applications from virtual machines to microservice architecture and to deploy them on AWS EKS/ECS. To implement this I've designed and planned a new infrastructure in the cloud using IaC principles, which ment deploying via Terraform. Also, I migrated a number of services from on-premise to the cloud and implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and applications deployment. In general, completing those tasks helped to improve reliability and scalability, reduce costs, to have zero-downtime rollouts and continuous deployment. While working on the project, I investigated a number of proof concepts and implemented some of them for the project's improvement. I took part in cost optimization processes and preparation for the company's audit regarding the AWS DevOps and AWS Migration Competency certification. I conducted technical interviews for DevOps positions and facilitated onboarding processes for newcomers.
Project in the telecommunication domain
The main task was to deploy infrastructure on a private cloud and on-premise/dedicated servers using Terraform and Ansible; Kubernetes clusters were the core infrastructure. Also, the main requirement from the customers' side was to store source code and docker images in non-public repositories, which required deploying GitLab local service and MinIO isolated storage service on dedicated servers. After investigating a number of proof of concepts our team implemented optimal ways of completing the task. As a result, we had automatical infrastructure and applications deployment using AWS Cloud and dedicated servers on the OVH datacenter.

devops,"As a professional in DevOps and Cybersecurity, I undertake a range of tasks to optimize software delivery processes and secure IT environments. In my DevOps role, I focus on building and maintaining efficient workflows by designing CI/CD pipelines to automate code integration, testing, and deployment. I work closely with development and operations teams to enhance system scalability, reliability, and performance. My responsibilities include infrastructure setup, container management, orchestration, and monitoring deployed applications.
In Cybersecurity, I protect systems and data by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security controls, and responding to potential threats. This includes conducting risk assessments, configuring secure access policies, performing penetration tests, and analyzing logs to detect anomalies and ensure compliance with security standards.
For DevOps, I extensively use Jenkins to automate CI/CD pipelines, enabling seamless integration and deployment of code. I rely on Git for version control, managing repositories, and collaborating with teams on codebases. To handle containerization, I use Docker to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. For orchestration, I leverage Kubernetes to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications across clusters, ensuring high availability and resilience. Additionally, I utilize ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous deployment, allowing declarative configuration management and automated synchronization of Kubernetes resources with Git repositories.
Beyond these, I work with cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, and monitoring solutions such as Prometheus and Grafana. In Cybersecurity, I use tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Splunk, alongside scripting languages like Python and Bash, to automate tasks and strengthen security postures.

devops,"Over the past six years, I have gained extensive experience with Google Cloud Platform, including Google Kubernetes Engine and many other services, as well as Terraform.
I've undertaken projects from the ground up - definitely.
I've managed migrations from other cloud services - absolutely.
Certified  GCP Cloud Architect
Looking for engaging part-time opportunities on GCP. I prefer to avoid tedious six-tier interviews.
Additionally, I am not interested in AWS or Azure."
devops,"I’m a Junior DevOps Engineer with 1+ year of hands-on experience working in a remote, async team. My responsibilities include Linux server administration (CentOS, Ubuntu), automation with Bash and Python, and managing application servers like Tomcat and Nginx. I monitor infrastructure using Zabbix and Grafana, and I’m actively involved in improving system stability and visibility.
I work with Docker and custom Dockerfiles to containerize internal services, and I have initial experience deploying applications in Kubernetes test environments using Helm. I manage version control with Git (GitHub, Bitbucket), and configure Jenkins pipelines for internal automation tasks. I also support MySQL databases and basic Percona replication.
In backend collaboration, I’ve worked with simple Go-based REST APIs and have basic knowledge of Java (Spring Boot) and FastAPI project structures. I’m organized, independent, and reliable — always delivering tasks on time.
Currently, I’m focused on growing into a Mid-level role with stronger skills in CI/CD, IaC (Terraform), and cloud platforms like AWS. I’m seeking a team where I can learn, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a DevOps professional."
devops,"I'm unstoppable when it comes to getting the job done.
I've worked with a lot of different technologies and mastered many of them to get results that are: 1. simple, 2. cost-efficient, 3. secure, and 4. reliable.
I started my career as a technical support engineer in the networking field around 8 years ago. That role gave me a solid understanding of customers' needs and behavior, as well as strong Linux fundamental skills.
Since then, for the past 6 years, I've mainly focused on observability at massive scale. I've become a key player in my team, and our work has become a core part of the business. I feel a personal responsibility for success of this project, and I work hard to help the team achieve it.
For years, I've worked with AWS and GCP clouds. I started with AWS but I'm an expert in GCP. Physical servers and VMs have also been a big part of my work, along with tools like Ansible, Terraform (and even AWS CloudFormation at some point :D), and Python, of course.
Automation is what really drives me. I don't dream of a magic ""make it cool"" button anymore, but I'm happy to reduce human intervention wherever possible. Kubernetes is one of my favorite tools whether it's GKE, EKS, K3s, or bare-metal Kubernetes - I love it.
I'm also experienced with Kafka, and Kubernetes has been especially helpful for automating Kafka and related tasks. Developing Kubernetes Operators (aka custom controllers) is another passion, which has helped me automate complex workflows and, thus, optimize operational management for teams working with the system.
I also use GitOps methodology, particularly with ArgoCD/Flux, to create easily replicable cloud/bare-metal infrastructures. Making Git the single source of truth has been the backbone of many of my infrastructure projects.
My programming experience is mainly with Python, plus some Go. From Jenkins scripts to self-sufficient apps for observability collection, to APIs that cover access to services, etc.
Lastly, I take security seriously. I have broad experience with HashiCorp Vault, which I've used to keep sensitive data secure and ensure that our systems are well-protected.
I'd thrive in a community that's ambitious, motivated to improve every day, and passionate about taking over the world with their solutions.

Not just DevOps but en enjeneer.
DevOps is a part of my life, the part i have most expensive with. After all challenges I faced last years i consider myself as an Engineer. The guy who is going to solve problems. My goal is to identify where the real issue is and propose a solution.
What is DevOps for me? It's not just set up a CI/CD or something. It's boring, any junior engineer can do it after realising that everything is written in documentation. DevOps is more like to see whole project, find the weakest parts and fix them. It's to take the responsibility for slowing issues that other team members can't fix and find a solution.
What is engineer for me? It's like to take a new, unknown technology, study it, become an expert in it and lead a leam building application based on this technology.
