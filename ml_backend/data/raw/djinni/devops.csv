devops,"За останні кілька років я працював над масштабними проектами, такими як міграція OLAP-систем на AWS, створення Kubernetes-архітектури для мікросервісів, а також автоматизація DevOps процесів у багатохмарному середовищі. Основні технології, з якими працюю: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GCP. У команді я виконую роль технічного лідера, займаюся архітектурою та впровадженням інноваційних рішень, а також допомагаю іншим інженерам розвиватися. У майбутньому планую поглиблювати знання у сфері MLOps та DevSecOps, а також працювати над покращенням масштабованості та безпеки хмарних рішень.
Серед ключових досягнень я б виділив наступні:
Провів міграцію Hadoop-базованого OLAP-софту до AWS, що дозволило знизити операційні витрати на 25% і суттєво підвищити продуктивність системи.
Впровадив автоматизовану CI/CD-платформу для serverless-додатків, що зменшило час деплою з кількох годин до 20 хвилин.
Розробив високодоступну хмарну архітектуру на AWS з використанням Kubernetes та Fargate, що забезпечило 99,99% uptime.
Координував команду DevOps-інженерів для впровадження DevSecOps-практик, що дозволило знизити кількість вразливостей у коді на 50%.
Навчив команду з 50+ розробників використовувати Kubernetes та Docker, що сприяло швидкому старту нових проектів.
Від роботи очікую цікавих завдань у сфері хмарних технологій, автоматизації інфраструктури та DevOps. Хочу мати змогу впливати на технічні рішення, працювати у команді професіоналів і розвивати свої навички, зокрема в MLOps та DevSecOps. Ціную гнучкість у роботі, прозору комунікацію і можливість вчитися новому.
Щодо того, чого я не хочу: це робота без чітких цілей і перспектив розвитку, відсутність автоматизації процесів та середовище, де немає підтримки і командної взаємодії."

devops,"•	Migrated legacy CI/CD to GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
I replaced outdated Jenkins pipelines with GitOps-driven CI/CD processes, cutting down deployment time, increasing reliability, and reducing pipeline maintenance. I’ve worked closely with dev teams to introduce reusable, secure pipelines integrated with Docker builds, Kubernetes deployments, and IaC checks.
•	Optimized AWS usage to cut cloud costs by 35%
At one client, I helped bring their AWS bill down from $25,000/month to $16,000/month by switching to Graviton processors, spot instances, reserved capacity for RDS and ElastiCache, and right-sizing EC2 workloads — all while maintaining availability and performance.
•	Built automated infrastructure with Terraform & Terragrunt
Using Terraform and Terragrunt, I designed modular infrastructure stacks for staging and production environments. I implemented reusable patterns, enforced environment consistency, and used Atlantis to fully automate pull request–based deployments, disabling direct AWS access for engineers.
•	Designed disaster recovery and high availability strategies
I implemented cross-region backup, replication, and failover policies for business-critical systems. This included testing recovery procedures and setting up monitoring to ensure systems could handle failure scenarios gracefully.
•	Managed container workloads with Kubernetes & Helm
I’ve deployed and maintained microservices on Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts, handling configuration, autoscaling, and rolling updates. I also integrated deployments with GitLab CI and used Prometheus/Grafana to track performance and cluster health.
•	Established full-stack observability
I set up and maintained real-time monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and OpenSearch. These tools gave dev and ops teams deep visibility into their systems, speeding up incident response and enabling proactive troubleshooting.

devops,"I have experience working with international customers for approximately 9 years with experience of leaderships in IT company.
I have been working in DevOps direction for more than 8 years and love it. I will know such technology as CD (Ansible, CloudFormation, Terraform, Helm), CI (Jenkins, Bamboo) system of version control (GitLab, Git, GitHub, BitBucket), different AWS services like EC2, RDS, VPC ECS, etc.
And many more specific things that, I could describe in my CV but not here.
I've developed and built from scratch operational processes for multiple customers. I automated a large amount of Kubernetes platforms. So I have a solid knowledge and clear understanding of What kind of common mistakes can appear and how they should be resolved.
Professional growing, Hard tasks, Curious projects."
devops,"I've been working in DevOps for 7 years with about 20 years in the industry overall.
I started as the small office's system administrator managing a FreeBSD server, never stopped learning new methodologies, approaches and software.
Growing the knowledge and projects' complexity, leveraging the power of automation such as Ansible, bash scripts and Puppet and virtualization such as KVM, Xen and VMWare, reduced routine operations and made more time for projects' needs: bringing value instead of just being tech.
I switched from bare metal computing to cloud computing, starting from GCP and moving on to AWS which is my main cloud provider. Moreover, I took projects using the third major cloud provider, Azure.
When containers emerged, it provided a tremendous boost to working process efficiency, combined with virtualization and pay-as-you-go cloud providers' model allowed me to implement these technologies and methodologies and take yet another step towards operational excellence and focusing on business values.
Having a background in network and system administration, I feel confident both in creating infrastructures and automating workflows from scratch as well as importing existing ones into code, making infrastructure management easy and reproducible.
Also, I always work with security in mind, shifting left whenever possible and leveraging the idea that it's always easier to foresee and prevent than to fix.
Virtualized existing physical servers and allowing centralized virtual server (VMWare vSphere) management and flexibility.
Designed and implemented a ransomware-protected centralized backup system.
Developed and built project network infrastructure including VPN connections from branch offices and remote workstations, on-prem and in the cloud depending on the project.
Created automated workflows, and refactored inefficient/outdated ones.
Reworked legacy code using modern solutions.
Imported project's infrastructure into code (Terraform) and automated change management and monitoring
Set up or improved monitoring systems (Datadog, Grafana stack, ELK stack) depending on the project.
Created layered infrastructure using Terragrunt for multi-tenant and test environments.
Designed the organization's security policies both for cloud infrastructures and Kubernetes environments
Mentored colleagues and adjacent teams to increase awareness of the project's components
I'm seeking new challenges in building modern and secure infrastructures and workflows, making use of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence."

Developed a full-stack CRM application using Django as the backend and Nuxt.js as the frontend framework. This has given me some understanding of how applications are built, how to read code, and where to find relevant information when needed.
Played a key role in developing a dynamic Jenkins environment for multiple development teams. The main goal was to enable developers to create their own Jenkins instances with minimal effort and in the shortest time possible.
Developed an almost fully dynamic EKS environment for a client, with cost-efficiency as the primary goal. Spot instances (or, if unavailable, on-demand instances) were created, removed, and managed by a Karpenter Node Pool configured to provision the desired instance families. Pod allocation to these nodes was managed by a custom Kubernetes scheduler, which allocated pods to nodes with the highest resource usage, ensuring optimal resource utilization. Once the workload was completed, the instances were immediately terminated."

devops,"Маю значний досвід у ролі Linux системного адміністратора та DevOps інженера, зокрема в роботі з хмарними технологіями та автоматизації процесів. Протягом кар'єри я реалізував численні проекти, що охоплюють налаштування інфраструктури, автоматизацію завдань, розгортання додатків та підтримку високої доступності систем.
Основні досягнення:
Архітектура та оптимізація інфраструктури: Спроектував та впровадив нову архітектуру для внутрішньої поштової системи в CITRUS, що покращило ефективність обробки запитів. Перевів внутрішні сервіси на контейнерну архітектуру, що дозволило спростити масштабування та знизити витрати ресурсів.
Автоматизація та управління інфраструктурою: Впровадив практики IaC (Infrastructure as Code) за допомогою Ansible та Terraform, що зменшило час на деплой і оновлення сервісів. Створив пайплайни для автоматичного збору снепшотів та оновлення конфігурацій інфраструктури.
Хмарні технології: Працював з GCP як основним хмарним провайдером, налаштовував VPC мережі та взаємодію між віртуальними машинами. Розгортав кластер Cassandra для зберігання даних з високою доступністю та налаштовував веб-додатки (NGINX/Apache) для клієнтів.
Адміністрування серверів і підтримка інфраструктури: Адміністрував мережеве обладнання (роутери, комутатори), оптимізував SQL бази даних, підтримував платформу 1C:Enterprise, налаштовував бекапи на AWS для критичних систем та виконував апаратну діагностику офісної техніки.
Ключові навички:
DevOps: Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, CI/CD
Облачні технології: GCP, AWS
Контейнеризація: Docker, Kubernetes
Адміністрування: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), NGINX, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL
Моніторинг: Prometheus, Grafana
Мережі: Cisco, MikroTik
Серверы: Dell, Lenovo
Моя мета — застосовувати свої навички для оптимізації процесів, забезпечення стабільної роботи інфраструктури та автоматизації рутинних завдань для підвищення ефективності компанії.
Автоматизація інфраструктури: Впровадив практики IaC (Infrastructure as Code) за допомогою Ansible та Terraform, що значно зменшило час на деплой та оновлення внутрішніх сервісів. Розробив автоматизовані пайплайни для збору снепшотів віртуальних машин та оновлення конфігурацій.
Модернізація інфраструктури: Перевів внутрішні сервіси компанії на контейнерну архітектуру, що дозволило покращити масштабованість і знизити витрати на ресурси. Розгорнув кластер Cassandra для високодоступного зберігання даних.
Хмарні технології: Працював з GCP для налаштування VPC мереж та взаємодії між віртуальними машинами, а також налаштовував моніторинг та збір метрик з робочих середовищ клієнтів.
Підтримка інфраструктури: Адміністрував SQL бази даних та налаштовував бекапи на AWS для критичних інфраструктурних компонентів. Керував 1C:Enterprise, здійснював регулярні оновлення та підтримку систем.
Комунікація з клієнтами: Встановлював та підтримував безпосередній контакт з клієнтами для уточнення технічних вимог та забезпечення належної підтримки розгортання та налаштування інфраструктури.
Прозорі процеси та відсутність теневих взаємодій: Хочу працювати в компанії, де всі робочі процеси чітко визначені, комунікація є відкритою, а всі рішення ухвалюються прозоро. Важливо, щоб не було неформальних угод або ""теневих"" взаємодій.
Удалена робота: Пошук можливості працювати повністю в удаленому форматі, що дозволить зберігати баланс між професійним і особистим життям.
Надання робочої техніки: Я вважаю, що безпека і ефективність роботи залежать від використання корпоративної техніки. Тому важливо, щоб компанія надавала необхідне обладнання для виконання робочих завдань.
Адекватний анбординг та інтеграція в команду: Очікую на добре структурований процес анбордингу, що включає знайомство з компанією, проектами та командою, а також надання всіх необхідних доступів для ефективної роботи з першого дня.
Інтеграція в загальний контекст проекту: Важливо, щоб нові співробітники мали повний доступ до актуальної інформації та ресурсів, що дозволяють швидко увійти в курс справи і почати продуктивно працювати на проекті."

Automation of various processes was a common practice, accomplished through the development of Bash and PowerShell scripts. Our database infrastructure relied on PostgreSQL, seamlessly integrated into our SRM system.
Working with diverse technologies, I have adeptly handled Active Directory, Windows Server, VoIP, freeIPA, VPN, and SSH. Proficiency extends to configuring networking equipment such as Mikrotik routers and implementing web server solutions like Nginx. Additionally, I have successfully utilized cPanel as a mail server. Deployment of servers was streamlined using Docker on dedicated Debian servers, fostering a containerized approach for enhanced efficiency. I am always ready to learn new technologies and find effective solutions to complex problems in the field of IT technologies."

First and most important, the team/people. I'm an easy going person who loves to meet new people, learn from them and teach them as well. I love sharing, I truly believe that it's something that should be address at all levels, in your daily life, with friends and of course on your job.
Money is important as well, but I will never work on something that I do not like just for the money!"

Last project
The main task was to migrate applications from virtual machines to microservice architecture and to deploy them on AWS EKS/ECS. To implement this I've designed and planned a new infrastructure in the cloud using IaC principles, which ment deploying via Terraform. Also, I migrated a number of services from on-premise to the cloud and implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and applications deployment. In general, completing those tasks helped to improve reliability and scalability, reduce costs, to have zero-downtime rollouts and continuous deployment. While working on the project, I investigated a number of proof concepts and implemented some of them for the project's improvement. I took part in cost optimization processes and preparation for the company's audit regarding the AWS DevOps and AWS Migration Competency certification. I conducted technical interviews for DevOps positions and facilitated onboarding processes for newcomers.
Project in the telecommunication domain
The main task was to deploy infrastructure on a private cloud and on-premise/dedicated servers using Terraform and Ansible; Kubernetes clusters were the core infrastructure. Also, the main requirement from the customers' side was to store source code and docker images in non-public repositories, which required deploying GitLab local service and MinIO isolated storage service on dedicated servers. After investigating a number of proof of concepts our team implemented optimal ways of completing the task. As a result, we had automatical infrastructure and applications deployment using AWS Cloud and dedicated servers on the OVH datacenter.
Project in e-commerce, online education
I’ve implemented CI/CD on a few small projects, which helped deploy and update the website’s content faster. This solution is used on other projects as a template.

devops,"I’m a Junior DevOps Engineer with 1+ year of hands-on experience working in a remote, async team. My responsibilities include Linux server administration (CentOS, Ubuntu), automation with Bash and Python, and managing application servers like Tomcat and Nginx. I monitor infrastructure using Zabbix and Grafana, and I’m actively involved in improving system stability and visibility.
I work with Docker and custom Dockerfiles to containerize internal services, and I have initial experience deploying applications in Kubernetes test environments using Helm. I manage version control with Git (GitHub, Bitbucket), and configure Jenkins pipelines for internal automation tasks. I also support MySQL databases and basic Percona replication.
In backend collaboration, I’ve worked with simple Go-based REST APIs and have basic knowledge of Java (Spring Boot) and FastAPI project structures. I’m organized, independent, and reliable — always delivering tasks on time.
Currently, I’m focused on growing into a Mid-level role with stronger skills in CI/CD, IaC (Terraform), and cloud platforms like AWS. I’m seeking a team where I can learn, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a DevOps professional."
devops,"I'm unstoppable when it comes to getting the job done.
I've worked with a lot of different technologies and mastered many of them to get results that are: 1. simple, 2. cost-efficient, 3. secure, and 4. reliable.
I started my career as a technical support engineer in the networking field around 8 years ago. That role gave me a solid understanding of customers' needs and behavior, as well as strong Linux fundamental skills.
Since then, for the past 6 years, I've mainly focused on observability at massive scale. I've become a key player in my team, and our work has become a core part of the business. I feel a personal responsibility for success of this project, and I work hard to help the team achieve it.
For years, I've worked with AWS and GCP clouds. I started with AWS but I'm an expert in GCP. Physical servers and VMs have also been a big part of my work, along with tools like Ansible, Terraform (and even AWS CloudFormation at some point :D), and Python, of course.
Automation is what really drives me. I don't dream of a magic ""make it cool"" button anymore, but I'm happy to reduce human intervention wherever possible. Kubernetes is one of my favorite tools whether it's GKE, EKS, K3s, or bare-metal Kubernetes - I love it.
I'm also experienced with Kafka, and Kubernetes has been especially helpful for automating Kafka and related tasks. Developing Kubernetes Operators (aka custom controllers) is another passion, which has helped me automate complex workflows and, thus, optimize operational management for teams working with the system.
I also use GitOps methodology, particularly with ArgoCD/Flux, to create easily replicable cloud/bare-metal infrastructures. Making Git the single source of truth has been the backbone of many of my infrastructure projects.
My programming experience is mainly with Python, plus some Go. From Jenkins scripts to self-sufficient apps for observability collection, to APIs that cover access to services, etc.
Lastly, I take security seriously. I have broad experience with HashiCorp Vault, which I've used to keep sensitive data secure and ensure that our systems are well-protected.
I'd thrive in a community that's ambitious, motivated to improve every day, and passionate about taking over the world with their solutions.

- Refactored and designed a new allowlist automation for multiple platforms (Jira, AWS, Datadog, Github, Snowflake), serving as a single source of truth. I designed the IP file structure, architecture for different services using YAML files. I implemented automation for Jira, AWS, Datadog and CI/CD pipelines with parallel deploy to multiple AWS accounts & integrations via Github Actions.
- Integrated SonarQube for a GitHub organization with 1000+ repositories. (Created reusable workflows to be called in child repositories, triggering SonarQube; enforced branch protection for SonarQube checks in repositories during pull request reviews.)

DevOps is a part of my life, the part i have most expensive with. After all challenges I faced last years i consider myself as an Engineer. The guy who is going to solve problems. My goal is to identify where the real issue is and propose a solution.
What is DevOps for me? It's not just set up a CI/CD or something. It's boring, any junior engineer can do it after realising that everything is written in documentation. DevOps is more like to see whole project, find the weakest parts and fix them. It's to take the responsibility for slowing issues that other team members can't fix and find a solution.
What is engineer for me? It's like to take a new, unknown technology, study it, become an expert in it and lead a leam building application based on this technology.

devops,"I'm a DevOps Engineer with a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, automation, and containerization. After 15 years in the automotive industry, where I developed strong skills in optimization and process management, I dedicated myself to DevOps, motivated by a passion for creating efficient and scalable systems.
My technical stack includes Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, and Grafana. I’ve completed several hands-on projects, including:
- Dockerized ToDo List Application: Built a containerized version of a Django web app.
- Kubernetes Deployment with Helm: Created Helm charts for deploying web applications on Kubernetes.
- CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions: Developed a robust pipeline that automates Docker image building and pushes to DockerHub, with matrix testing across multiple Python versions and OS types, plus customizable workflow inputs.

attitude.
I had an interesting experience working on many projects. In most cases, this applies to IoT in Cloud or on-premises environments.
One of the interesting projects was built on the VMware platform and with Haproxy and Kubernetes configurations was able to support 1 million parallel MQTT connections used by devices.
Frankly, there were fewer active devices, but the tests showed phenomenal results  =)
I probably couldn't list everything even if I wanted to.
It would be interesting to continue working with clouds (AWS/GCP). It will be a great pleasure if the project uses Kubernetes because I believe that this orchestration system is the best that is available at the moment and the future is based on it but of course, everything depends on the needs of the project."

devops,"Projects and Tasks Completed:
I have successfully contributed to multiple projects across cloud infrastructure, full-stack application development, and DevOps automation. Notable achievements include designing and deploying scalable cloud architectures, developing custom enterprise applications, and implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment processes.
Technologies Used:
My work spans various technologies, including AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, JavaScript (React, Node.js), PHP, and MySQL/PostgreSQL. I have also worked extensively with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and Ansible and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Current Role in the Team:
As a junior team member, I collaborate with other team members, ensuring project goals align with strategic objectives. I collaborate with cross-functional teams and learn fast from my senior colleagues' implementation of best practices in coding, security, and deployment.
What I Want to Improve:
I aim to deepen my AI and machine learning technologies expertise to incorporate smarter features into cloud and application solutions. I am also focused on further refining my leadership and project management skills to drive greater efficiency and innovation within teams.
One of my key accomplishments was to play a major role in the migration of a large enterprise application to the cloud. I designed the architecture using AWS services like EC2, RDS, and S3 and implemented Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, which reduced deployment time by 50%. I also automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
Another significant achievement was spearheading the development of a custom ERP system. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to define requirements, developed the backend using Node.js and PostgreSQL, and created a dynamic front end with React. This project improved operational efficiency by 40% and earned client praise for its scalability and user-friendly design.
I value a collaborative and innovative environment where I can grow my career in cloud engineering, DevOps, and full-stack development to create impactful solutions. I’m seeking opportunities to work on challenging projects that push the boundaries of technology, especially in cloud-native architectures, automation, and scalable applications. Professional growth and learning are important to me, so I look for organizations that encourage training, knowledge-sharing, and continuous skill improvement.
What I Don’t Want:
I prefer to avoid workplaces with poor communication, lack of clear goals, or outdated processes that hinder productivity and innovation. I also seek environments where technical expertise is respected and where team efforts are valued over siloed or overly competitive dynamics."

devops,"Memory updated
To emphasize your transition from a backend developer and AI integrator to focusing more on DevOps, here's how you can modify your description:
I initially worked as a backend developer and AI integrator, gaining experience in integrating machine learning and deep learning models into various applications. Over time, I began shifting my focus towards DevOps, working with automation, containerization, and orchestration to streamline the development process and AI model deployments.
My technical experience includes:
Backend Development: Java, Go, C#, Python
Frameworks: Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, MVC, Web API
ORM: Hibernate, MyBatis, Entity Framework Core, JDBC
Databases: PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server
Messaging & Data Storage: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch
Containers & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes (K8s)
Other Tools: OpenCV, Gstreamer
DevOps: Strong focus on Linux environments, CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and managing infrastructure as code.
This transition allows me to integrate my development expertise with DevOps practices, creating a more efficient and scalable workflow for building, deploying, and maintaining applications.
I take pride in having streamlined the workflow for AI engineers in my last project by automating the environment setup for computer vision tasks. This involved configuring tools such as CUDA, OpenCV, and other essential libraries. Additionally, I deployed the application using Docker Compose, ensuring that it was easily scalable and maintainable. To further optimize the system, I designed a custom communication protocol, akin to a binary protocol, to ensure efficient data transfer and processing between services.
I expect constant work on new projects, as I want to improve my skills. I would like to work with projects where microservices need to be implemented. Mostly Fintech"

- IaC: Terraform (4+ years), Terraform Cloud (2+ years), Cloudformation (2+ years), Crossplane (1+ years),
- Kubernetes (~4 years), Helm (2+ years), Kustomize (2+ years)
- GitOps: ArgoCD (2+ years), FluxCD (1+ year),
- CI/CD: Gitlab (4+ years), Jenkins (2+ years), GitHub Actions (1+ years)
- Scripting: Groovy (3+ years), Python (2+ years), Bash
The most relevant DevOps projects:

2. Healthcare web app. As a single DevOps engineer, I was planning and implementing all of the DevOps activities from scratch. Creating a multi-account AWS Org structure fully automated using terraform and Terraform Cloud and implementing CI/CD process using Gitlab and ArgoCD.
Tools: Terraform Cloud, AWS Organizations, AWS SSO, AWS Transit Gateway, EKS, Gitlab, Kustomize, ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, Loki/Prom stack, etc.
3. Blockchain lending app. As a single DevOps engineer, I was working on the creation of a new multi-account AWS platform from scratch.
Tools: Terraform Cloud, Sentinel, AWS Organizations, GitHub Actions.
4. Fintech project. Being a part of a small DevSecOps team with a primary focus on resolving any security-related issues as well as improving and automating internal processes.
Tools: AWS, EKS, Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, GitLab, Helm, FluxCD, SecurityHub, GuardDuty, AWS Config.

devops,"Я DevOps-інженер з чималим досвідом у проєктуванні, впровадженні та підтримці інфраструктури для високонавантажених систем. Моя експертиза охоплює управління VPS-середовищами, автоматизацію розгортань, CI/CD процесів, оптимізацію продуктивності та забезпечення стабільної роботи серверів та ресурсів.
Протягом кар'єри я впроваджував рішення для моніторингу, логування, резервного копіювання, масштабування сервісів і підвищення надійності інфраструктури. Особливу увагу приділяю автоматизації рутинних процесів і впровадженню кращих практик DevOps — від IaC до повної автоматизації життєвого циклу застосунків.
Маю глибоке розуміння принципів системної інтеграції, безперервної доставки та віддаленого керування інфраструктурою. Впевнений у роботі з сучасними інструментами й технологіями, постійно вивчаю новій та знаходжу нові шляхи для вирішення питань чи проблем,  завжди орієнтуюсь на ефективність, стабільність і масштабованість рішень.
Шукаю можливість долучитися до технічно сильної команди та працювати над викликовими проєктами, де можу застосувати свій досвід для побудови надійної DevOps-інфраструктури.
- Керував масштабною VPS-інфраструктурою: розгортання, конфігурація, оновлення програмного забезпечення, моніторинг систем для забезпечення стабільності, продуктивності та безвідмовної роботи.
- Автоматизував процеси розгортання та обслуговування серверів за допомогою Ansible, GitLab CI/CD, Bash-скриптів — що дозволило значно скоротити час на рутинні операції та зменшити простої.
- Оптимізував витрати на хостинг та серверну інфраструктуру: аналіз провайдерів, впровадження економічно ефективних рішень без шкоди для надійності.
- Інтегрував Telegram-ботів для автоматизації DevOps-процесів і моніторингу серверів у режимі реального часу.
- Працював із Nginx, Cloudflare, системами кешування та балансування навантаження для досягнення високої доступності й швидкодії сервісів.
- Розробляв внутрішні інструменти для спрощення DevOps-операцій, масштабування середовищ і оптимізації щоденних процесів.
- Додатково впроваджував AI-рішення для автоматизації рутинних завдань, зниження залежності від платних сервісів та підвищення ефективності — включно зі створенням простих AI-асистентів та інтеграцією LLM у робочі процеси.
Я ціную можливість працювати в динамічному середовищі, де є простір для розвитку, навчання та впровадження нових технологій. Мені важливо, щоб компанія прагнула до інновацій та підтримувала ініціативність, надаючи можливість розширювати свої компетенції та застосовувати нові підходи на практиці. Ціную командну роботу, відкритий обмін знаннями та можливість виходити за межі стандартних обов’язків для пошуку оптимальних рішень."

As a result, manual testing time was reduced by 40%, and the overall reliability of test results was significantly improved.
3. Successfully reanimated and maintained a bare-metal GitLab server that was frequently showing 500 errors, running an outdated major version, and had disks with bad clusters and insufficient storage space. Working only during off-hours to avoid disruption, I mount-ed the disks, created a full backup, umount-ed the disks, set up the same old version on a new server, remounted the disks, and then systematically updated the server through all major versions, ensuring uninterrupted CI/CD processes for over 50 developers.
What I Want: I prefer to work with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Ansible and Terraform to automate and manage infrastructure. This approach minimizes human error and allows for efficient automation and consistent deployment.
What I Don’t Want: I want to avoid high-stress situations that require manual fixes in production, such as emergency reanimation of old servers. I am more interested in environments where infrastructure is modernized and automated to prevent such issues.
My Perspective: Before addressing whether I know the infrastructure, it's important to consider how long it would take to restore all resources in the event of a complete failure."

Production Engineering Manager, Google, Looker February 15, 2020, Herman managed Denys directly Denys was supporting my group in Google as a contractor devops/release engineer and i am truly impressed with his abilities to quickly learn new systems and then deliver implementation. He showed focus, drive, great organization, and independence in execution. Denys had a task to create dynamic dashboard that shows (to development and release teams) the issues that affect releases as they get discovered.
Denys independently clarified requirements, find out which internal systems are useful and can be re-used, worked with partners on design and code review.
As a result he was able to implement the dashboard in rather short time, and it is in used daily by several teams. One of the first things i look at the morning.
Working remotely, Denys kept me updated about state of the progress in the daily reports and weekly meetings, where he was always come prepared with his status and was clear if anything he needs from me to get unblocked. With Denys being remote i had initial reservations if the arrangements will work out. I was positively surprised how good our partnership and project worked out at the end I highly recommend Denys as technically strong, independent and focused on execution devops/ release engineer."

2024 — 2025
Проєкт 1: Інфраструктура на AWS
Створив базову інфраструктуру для сайту на AWS: EC2, S3 Bucket, CloudFront, RDS, ElastiCache.
Налаштував Docker та написав docker-compose для деплою додатка.
Реалізував CI/CD пайплайн через GitHub Actions — автоматизована збірка Docker-образів і деплой на EC2.
Проєкт 2: Інфраструктура на AWS з Terraform
Створив хмарну інфраструктуру на AWS з використанням: ALB (Application Load Balancer), ECS (Elastic Container Service), ECR (Elastic Container Registry), RDS, ElastiCache.
Написав Terraform-код для створення та управління всіма ресурсами, та інфраструктурою загалом, автоматизував процеси розгортання.
Налаштував CI/CD пайплайн: збірка Docker-образів, пуш до ECR та автоматичний деплой на ECS.
Включив базове логування серверів із системою алертів для моніторингу стану сервісів.
Результат:
Обидва проєкти успішно працювали — це були тестові сайти, де кнопки Test RDS і Test Redis відправляли запити до відповідних сервісів для перевірки їхньої роботи, в першому випадку frontend сервіс є статичним в другому випадку динамічним.
Оптимізував деплой: налаштував CI/CD пайплайни, що скоротили час розгортання з 30 хвилин до 5 хвилин (автоматизація через GitHub Actions / Terraform).
Покращив надійність інфраструктури: налаштував автоштабування та аларми, які запобігли відмовам при пікових навантаженнях.
Знизив ризики: завдяки Docker-образам та Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), спростив відтворюваність середовища й мінімізував людський фактор.
Розгорнув хмарну інфраструктуру з нуля: за допомогою AWS (ECS, ECR, ALB) та Terraform створив повністю автоматизоване середовище для тестового сайту.
Отримати практичний досвід у реальних DevOps-процесах, працювати з сучасними інструментами та хмарними сервісами, бути частиною команди, де можна зростати, навчатись і ділитись досвідом, брати участь у побудові стабільної, безпечної інфраструктури

As cloud providers i have experience with AWS(more) and GCP(less), more or less worked with non top providers like DigitalOcean/Vultr, Hetzner, etc.
From the technology and tools perspective I've work with various toolsets, for example if we talk about relational and non-relational databases it would be - MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL, MySQL as well.
For providing principles of the CI/CD I've used different tools, a few of them is Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Travis, Github-actions, and others, also for the CD part and k8s there also used GitOps approach with ArgoCD and FluxCD.
In most cases automation was done with Shell/Bash.

devops,"I have led several projects that span on-premises systems, AWS, and Azure. Here’s a brief overview in plain language:
1. Cloud Infrastructure Automation:
On-Prem: I automated the setup of VMware-based clusters using tools like Terraform and custom scripts, making it easier to provision both physical and virtual machines.
AWS: I used CloudFormation and Terraform to build complete environments. This involved configuring core AWS services such as EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, Fargate, VPC, Route53, ELB, IAM, Direct Connect, S3, EBS, EFS, Glacier, RDS, DynamoDB, SSO, WAF, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, and Parallel Cluster to ensure robust, scalable, and secure deployments.
Azure: I built and managed pipelines in Azure DevOps using ARM templates and Terraform, ensuring that our cloud resources were efficiently provisioned and could work seamlessly with our on-prem systems.
2. Container Orchestration & Kubernetes:
I designed and maintained Kubernetes clusters on both AWS and Azure, ensuring our containerized applications run smoothly.
By using GitOps practices with ArgoCD and tools like Helm charts and Istio, I made our deployments more consistent and easier to roll back if needed.
3. Monitoring & Logging:
I set up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana across our on-prem and cloud environments. This allowed us to catch issues early and keep our systems running smoothly.
For logging and diagnostics, I implemented the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to provide a centralized view of our system performance and logs.
4. CI/CD Pipeline Modernization:
I built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Drone CI, and Azure DevOps. This helped streamline our build, test, and deployment processes.
I migrated older deployment processes to modern GitOps workflows, which improved version control, increased deployment speed, and reduced errors.
5. Security & Compliance Projects:
I played a key role in FedRAMP compliance projects, ensuring our AWS and Azure deployments met strict security standards. This involved aligning our processes and tools with the necessary security and compliance requirements.
In my current role as a Senior DevOps Engineer, I work closely with cross-functional teams to keep our systems efficient, secure, and innovative. I'm always looking for ways to improve our processes and adopt new technologies that can make our infrastructure even more reliable and scalable."
