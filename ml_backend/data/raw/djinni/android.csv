9 years in Android development
I have a diverse range of experience, from working on one-man projects from scratch to being a team lead in a small team of 5 developers, including myself. This includes both product-based and service-based companies. My current role is more of an outstaff position than outsourcing, as I work directly with the customer in an international team.
I inherited a broken project from a previous developer, fixed it, refactored the code, and made it maintainable.
I managed to catch up to, and even surpass, the iOS team in 3 months, despite having only one junior developer on my team.
I also persuaded the customer to migrate to Jetpack Compose, and after two years, I finally got approval—oh, the bureaucracy!
First of all, I'm interested in projects that don’t use an obsolete tech stack and in working with teams where I can find open-minded colleagues. I prefer product-based companies, but that doesn't mean projects in service companies are boring—it’s the bureaucracy that kills all the excitement."

Collaboration with designers, testers, and backend team: I closely collaborated with testers to identify and fix application issues. Furthermore, I actively engaged with the backend development team to optimize the client-server interaction.
Participation in discussions for new features: I actively participated in discussions with the development team, business analysts, and project managers to define and understand requirements for new features. My contributions included proposing ideas, analyzing technical feasibility, and providing suggestions to enhance the functionality of the application.
Assisting team members: I provided assistance to other members of the development team, particularly to newcomers, in their development tasks. I also mentored one of the new team members.

android,"I have been working as an Android developer for over five years. During my career, I had experience teaching Android development while I was at my university. It is very interesting to help your students discuss some of the nuances of the development and implementation of a particular technology. After training, I came to a project that required both the support of legacy projects and the development of new functions, adherence to our project's architectural rules, and communication about implementation with the people responsible for it. Also, out of personal interest, I volunteered to support an outdated project, since I have not yet worked with the technologies that are used there. In addition, I had experience in developing a project from scratch and in direct communication with the customer. Sometimes I did non-trivial development tasks, but more with the hardware of the device.
It is always interesting for me to learn something new, I do not hesitate to undertake any task, actively communicate with the management, often solve problems directly, which speeds up the result of my work.
In the future, I am interested in getting the opportunity to try myself as a team lead because I can communicate with people in addition to development. I know how to tune people to the right wave and enter the position of anyone to solve the problem as quickly as possible.
Graduated from the university with honors
Taught Android development
Implemented a new launcher for the international exhibition, due to which the product was sold more efficiently
Implemented architectural solution for the old legacy system, and rewrote most of the logic while not changing whole flow, so product started to support multiple entities for authentication (I can describe details on tech interview)
Fully written AI feature to work with GPT3-API, and fully finished product without documentation and any architecture to release. Upgraded app perfomance by 30%

Хочу від роботи:
Бути частиною команди, де поважають думку кожного та підтримують ініціативу.
Працювати над цікавим і корисним продуктом, яким приємно користуватись і який не соромно показати.
Використовувати сучасні технології та підходи, не працювати ""на відчепись"".
Відчувати, що моя робота має цінність і вплив.
Розвиватися професійно: вчитись у команди, ділитися досвідом, відвідувати конференції, прокачувати скіли.
Адекватний work-life balance — без постійних овертаймів і ""горіння"".
Зрозумілі задачі, чіткі цілі й прозорі процеси.
Нормальний менеджмент без мікроменеджменту.
Здоровий колектив, де немає токсичності.
Можливість працювати віддалено.
Стабільність: компанія, яка розуміє, куди рухається.
Не хочу:
Робити абищо тільки “щоб було” або з мікроскопа робити танк.
Застарілий стек без можливості впроваджувати нове.
Постійного стресу, дедлайнів ""на вчора"" і хаосу в управлінні.
Відсутності зворотного зв’язку або байдужості до продукту.
Роботи в компанії, яка не цінує людей або не дбає про команду.
Токсичної атмосфери, де панує бюрократія, конкуренція або політика.
Проєктів, де відсутнє технічне бачення, а пріоритети постійно змінюються без пояснення."

android,"I’m actively developing in the field of Android development. I focus on learning modern approaches to building mobile applications, paying special attention to project structure, clean code organization, and understanding how the system works under the hood.
My learning process is practice-oriented — I regularly work on self-assigned tasks, implementing user interfaces, data handling, navigation, and logic. Every technical issue or bug I solve becomes an opportunity to improve and learn something new.
What drives me most is the moment when something finally starts working after a long debugging process — that feeling of progress confirms I’m on the right path.
Over the course of my development journey, I've gained a deep understanding of essential components and core concepts in Android development, from mastering the clean architecture layers to implementing features like local data storage using Room.
This experience has inspired me to create my own pet project — a mobile app about cats. The idea came from my love for cats.
Building this project helps me apply all the concepts I've learned, from managing data flow and UI interaction to handling navigation and lifecycle events. It reflects both my technical progress and personal inspiration, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing through it.
Based on the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired, I’m developing a robust and well-structured application that combines modern technologies with meaningful functionality. This project is a practical implementation of everything I’ve studied, and it demonstrates my ability to build efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly software from the ground up.
Tech stack: Kotlin, Clean Architecture, Room, Dagger 2, Coroutines, MVVM, Work Manager.
I'm looking for an opportunity to join a team where I can grow through real-world experience, collaborate with more experienced developers, and continue improving my skills. I’m fully ready to invest my time and energy into becoming a strong Android developer."

android,"За час моєї роботи як Android-розробника я брав участь у створенні кількох мобільних додатків для Android, працюючи з різними архітектурами та технологіями. Мої основні проекти включали розробку додатків, де я використовував такі інструменти та технології:
Kotlin — основна мова для розробки, з фокусом на використання корутин і Kotlin Flow для асинхронної обробки даних.
Android SDK — робота з бібліотеками Android, такими як Room для баз даних, Retrofit для роботи з REST API, а також використання Broadcast Receiver і Service для обробки фонових завдань.
Clean Architecture — застосування принципів цієї архітектури для легшого тестування та кращої масштабованості проектів.
Jetpack Compose — розробка інтерфейсів за допомогою декларативної бібліотеки, що дозволяє зменшити кількість коду і підвищити ефективність роботи.
Dagger 2 / Hilt — використання інструментів для ін’єкції залежностей, що знижує кількість помилок і спрощує тестування.
MVP / MVVM — створення додатків за допомогою архітектур, що відокремлюють логіку від інтерфейсу і дозволяють полегшити тестування та підтримку коду.
JUnit / Espresso — тестування: написання юніт-тестів для перевірки логіки і інтеграційних тестів для взаємодії з інтерфейсом.
У команді моя роль полягає в активному участі в проєктуванні архітектури додатків, а також у написанні і тестуванні коду.
Мої напрямки розвитку: Я планую продовжувати свій розвиток у мобільній архітектурі та дизайні інтерфейсів (UI/UX). Зокрема, я хочу глибше вивчити Jetpack Compose і вдосконалювати навички роботи з складними інтерфейсами. Також хочу розвивати досвід у створенні багатокористувацьких додатків і інтеграції з новими API.
З часом я прагну розвивати свої навички у управлінні командами та отримати більше досвіду у вирішенні складних задач архітектури та побудові масштабованих систем."

Project description
SmartDeviceLink (SDL) is a standard set of protocols and messages that connect applications on a smartphone to a vehicle head unit. This messaging enables a consumer to interact with their application using common in-vehicle interfaces such as a touch screen display, embedded voice recognition, steering wheel controls and various vehicle knobs and buttons.
The app library component of SDL is meant to run on the end user’s smart-device from within SDL enabled apps, as an embedded app, or connected to the cloud. App libraries allow the apps to connect to SDL enabled head-units and hardware through bluetooth, USB, and TCP for Android, and cloud and embedded apps can connect through web sockets, Java Beans, and other custom transports. Once the library establishes a connection between the smart device and head-unit through the preferred method of transport, the two components are able to communicate using the SDL defined protocol. The app integrating this library project is then able to expose its functionality to the head-unit through text, media, and other interactive elements.

ILegeni is a hardware-oriented project which was built to monitor health status of patients and launch a device for artificial ventilation of the lungs if need. It included hardware part developed by Hardware-Devs using C language and software part developed by me with Java language. There were also 3d-modelists, therapists and military guys that worked together to create MVP that suits all of the conditions.
MVP was developed during COVID time and consisted of a box on the chest connected to the lungs, a health-tracker bracelet on the arm, data transmitter and a server that collected and monitored the data of all patients and turned on the lung ventilation device if necessary. It had it own's server-rooms, data transmitters, arm-trackers and a software that uses certain security techniques to prevent data leakage or theft. On the last stages that project were modified and used for a military purposes also.

android,I'm a mobile app developer with about 2 years of hands-on experience. Super stoked about merging my existing skills with new ones and taking on the exciting challenges that come with it. Always up for learning and adapting on the fly!
android,"My passion for programming started in the fifth grade of school, when we started learning the basics of algorithms in computer science classes using Scratch block programming. Later we switched to Pascal, and it was then that I realized that programming was what I wanted to do and what I was really interested in.
At university, I was introduced to low-level Assembler language, which allowed me to understand how a computer works at the machine level. After a while I started to actively learn C++, which became my main programming tool. Thanks to this language, I learned to understand algorithms written in most programming languages (except esoteric ones).
In the process of learning, I realized many projects in different programming languages. These ranged from simple console applications, such as bubble sort and quick sort, to more complex programs on Windows Forms and web applications with databases. One of my accomplishments was creating a custom web application from the To Do category.
I then decided to try my hand at mobile development and chose native iOS development. I first created simple 1-2 screen projects in Xcode, and later I developed from scratch a contact management application with authoring solutions, fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem.
I am willing to discuss salary at the start of the job as experience is paramount to me. All of my current skills are based on solving software related problems on my own. I strive to constantly update my own biological firmware, so I am open to new knowledge. It is very important for me to work in a friendly team where there will be friends, not just colleagues."

Also, I can remember my first big struggle, which was migration to Valley HTTP library which took me around 2 weeks, during which I read all available information online, asked questions at StackOverFlow, read HTTPS documentation, and finally proved that mistake wasn't on Android but on API provider configurations.

The project consisted of a POS application (order processing and administration) and an application for restaurant orders. I dug through a lot of legacy code - first I transferred everything to androidX, then from java to kotlin. Additionally, LeakCanary was run to ensure stability and speed.
The second project was more fun, although it is also in Java with a lot of legacy code. It was a chat with increased attention to security, based on one open-source project. It started with a simple SQLCypher and ended with the fact that even the packets sent to the server were encrypted.
The third project is applications for last-mile delivery (driver and client). Everything was fantastic here - the project was written considering the latest trends (Kotlin, Coroutines, Android Jetpack). In the beginning, it was necessary to catch up with the iOS department, which always had a developer. in fact, I had to redo everything on the fly.

experience in developing advanced applications for the Android platform. My
main functions were the creation of projects both from scratch and the support
of existing ones, along with extensive experience in working with virtually all
technologies available in the market. Proficient in:
Jetpack Compose:
A modern toolkit for building native Android UIs using a declarative approach,
Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development. Its reactive
programming model allows developers to easily build and manage UI
components, enhancing productivity and reducing boilerplate code.
Coroutines:
A concurrency design pattern in Kotlin that streamlines asynchronous
programming. Coroutines simplify complex asynchronous code, making it more
readable and maintainable by using a sequential style of code execution while
handling operations such as network requests and database interactions
efficiently.
Retrofit2:
A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, Retrofit2 simplifies the process
of making network requests. It supports JSON parsing via converters, making
it easier to handle API responses, and integrates seamlessly with other libraries
like RxJava and Coroutines for managing asynchronous operations.

android,"As an Android developer, I’ve worked on several projects that use the MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose. It’s been a rewarding journey, full of challenges that have helped me grow and sharpen my skills with these modern technologies.
One of the things I appreciate most about MVVM is how it separates the presentation layer from business logic. This makes the codebase easier to manage and scale as projects grow. Using data binding and observable patterns also ensures the UI stays in sync with data changes, which is crucial for a smooth user experience.
Jetpack Compose, on the other hand, has completely changed the way I approach UI development. Its declarative syntax and composable structure make it easy to build complex interfaces while keeping the code clean and maintainable. It also simplifies state management and reduces boilerplate, which means better performance and less time spent on repetitive tasks.

I developed the app from scratch for android platform using clean architecture coupled with MVP approach.
Also, I fix bugs and perform testing, besides this I optimize app in every way, to increase performance.
Upwork
I performed several types of tasks. The first one is a simple bug fixing, where sometimes need to find the NPE
only. The next one is adding some features or modules to existed application, and it was also easy.
So I started to write the skeletons for the applications using mockups.

android,"I started learning Android development in September, 2022. It was a part of my studying in university. Although the teaching program in this course should have been changed to a newer one (as we were taught to write Android programs on Java), I really liked that experience and decided to improve my knowledge of Android development with nowadays technologies.
I chose Kotlin as a main language for Android development, because it's the most popular programming language in this sphere and it's really nice to write code with. The UI framework I learned is Jetpack Compose, as it's much faster and easier to develop UI with.
My projects:
- An Android application in Kotlin for browsing a list of films, that are popular right now.
- A university project that simulates a social network. It does not have any connection with API. A lot of work to improve this project can be done, as I was working on it when I only started learning Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- Another university project. Although it is not an Android project, but a Compose for Desktop project ,it is worth to be mentioned, as it is written on Kotlin and the same UI framework (Compose). Me and my group mate decided to create an application for studying RISC-V assembly. Although it can be seen that the application is not finished, a huge work has been done. This program allows to run some RISC-V commands, debug them and monitor value of each register.
- A Kotlin multiplatform project that I'm currently working on with the same friend that I developed the university project for desktop which I mentioned before. At the moment, there is almost nothing in it, but the work is in process. Our aim is to develop a better and finished version of our course project. In addition we want to develop Android and IOS version as well.
You may find all the links in my CV.
I am highly interested in developing new features for Android applications and improve the existing ones. I can also develop Spring and Ktor API's as well as Kotlin Multiplatform applications."

Why experience of the software engineer matters?
I gives ability to code faster?
No.
It gives another benefit - quality of solutions.
Every solution has its benefits and downsides. Most of them are not obvious and will come into play later, when the scale of your app becomes bigger.
That will be the time when the quality of initial solutions made by developer on early stages of the project will make a decisive impact on product's life.

android,"During my career I participated in 10 projects. I worked as a solo Android developer as well as in a team of 3-4 Android developers.
Those projects were quite different, but overall I was responsible for:
- implementing new screens and features
- refactoring legacy code (MVP to MVVM, RxJava to Coroutines, etc.)
- communicating with clients when they needed technical expertise
- uploading apps to Google Play Market
- fixing bugs
Technical stack I used:

In the current project I work in the team of almost 50 people, along with 2 other Android developers. I find working in a big team much more compelling than being a solo Android developer on a project. This way I can gain experience from fellow developers, share my own knowledge and improve my soft skills. I want to pursue my career further and eventually become a Team Lead.
One of the toughest challenges for me was to implement a demo version of a complex feature in two weeks and deliver it to the client. The client wanted to present this feature to potential app buyers. This demo version had to at least mimick all the real life use-cases.
To implement everything perfectly was virtually impossible, so I had to decide which parts of the feature to expose and which to hide, where to use API calls and where to use mock data, where to simplify UI etc.
Being a perfectionist I hate to have something only halfway done. But with such tight schedule I had to sacrifice my perfectionism and implement as much as I could with the best result possible. Also all the QAs were busy with the release happening at the same time. So I had to test this feature myself and recheck everything thoroughly.
Eventually I delivered the feature to the client, he presented it to his clients and they loved it! We got a green light for adding this functionality to the future release and I was happy to implement it in full."

android,"I have built a number of commercial mobile projects, starting as a Native Developer and then switching to Flutter, integrating Native functionality when needed, with both Swift, Java, and Kotlin. My working domains include IoT, music (player app), custom Utility apps, and monitoring systems (dashboards), with all of them in both App Store and Google Play. I was responsible for publishing and maintaining releases in the Developer consoles.
I love UI, both Design and implementation, building components on screen, or figuring out algorithms and bug solutions, trying something new and bringing it to the working and then clean condition.
All my projects are available on Behance and GitHub (excluding those under NDA).
For State Management I have relied heavily on SetState for years, but this year I have learned Bloc, Riverpod, and Provider, with Riverpod making it to the commercial level, while others - hobby projects with a commercial-grade architecture.

In terms of Databases, most of the time I used SQLite (sqflite), but I know GraphQL, Drift, and have test projects with Firebase
In terms of RestAPIs, I have used it in the commercial environment, utilising Dio client(dio) and serialised models (json_serialisable), but some time ago our team used Mqtt for all networking, so I have experience with it too.
I have a good knowledge of DRY and SOLID/OOP principles, which I apply regularly to my code to ensure its readability and effectiveness. And I am also reviewing old libraries from time to time to get them up to the standards.

android,"I have no real experience in commercial mobile development with Java/Kotlin and am studying Computer Sciences at Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics (KhNURE).
During my studies, I have already worked on projects:
1. Messenger Project
Technologies used: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Spring WebFlux, WebSocket, Retrofit, MVVM
- Created a messaging application with custom backend using Spring WebFlux and WebSocket;
- Designed and implemented database schema using PostgreSQL;
- Developed real-time communication between Android client and server using WebSocket;
- Built responsive UI with Jetpack Compose and Material3 design principles.
2. Banking Application
Technologies used: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Firebase, MVVM, Flow;
- Implemented user authentication using Firebase Auth;
- Developed functionality for displaying payment cards and transaction history with Firestore;
- Created a modern UI using Jetpack Compose and Material Design principles;
- Used MVVM architecture with Flow.
3. Social Network Project (MBaaS)
Technologies used: Kotlin, XML, Backendless, Jira
- Developed an application using Backendless as a BaaS;
- Designed and implemented UI layouts using XML;
- Gained experience in cloud-based backend integration;
- Used Jira for project management and team collaboration.
4. GraphQL Project
Technologies used: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Apollo GraphQL, MVVM, Hilt
- Implemented data retrieval and management using GraphQL, working with an existing API;
- Integrated Apollo Client to handle queries;
- Used Hilt for dependency injection for the first time, gaining experience in improving code modularity and testability;
- Developed a responsive UI with Jetpack Compose;
- Optimized GraphQL queries to reduce network load and improve app performance;
- Applied MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
Throughout these projects, I've continuously learned and applied new Android development concepts, from basic app creation (as was the case with the Social Network App) to implementing more complex architectures and modern UI frameworks. I've gained valuable experience working with real-time data, integrating third-party services, and handling various aspects of modern Android development.
As I have no real experience in commercial development, my achievements have been both university projects and those I have worked on independently during my studies (so-called pet projects).
Initially, I started with learning Java and creating simple layouts in XML, implementing them, and creating basic application logic. Then, I moved on to Kotlin. Although I continued using XML for my projects at first, I gained significant experience with cloud services, such as Backendless and Google Firebase. Now, I can (almost) confidently use Jetpack Compose to build modern and efficient user interfaces.
I am eager to start my career as an Android developer, where I can apply and further develop my skills.
I am looking for a role that offers opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth, where I can work on challenging projects and collaborate with experienced professionals. I value an environment that encourages innovation, knowledge sharing, and creativity."

Projects:
The app on  Google Play – LexiVerse - Dictionary RU/EN (07.2023 - 09.2023)
I participated in the project as a developer focusing on user interface (UI/UX) design. Through collaboration a fully functional application was created and successfully published on Google Play. With this app users can learn foreign languages using dictionaries, translations, voice recordings, flashcards, and tests.
I was responsible for the development and support of the 'Learning Together' module, which included knowledge assessment features through tests and progress charts.
I handled the configuration and maintenance of the application's multi-modular architecture.
Professional Development (as part of training at GeekBrains) (04.2023 - 06.2023)
I independently developed a foreign language dictionary application. The goal of the project was to use external, free APIs to obtain translations.
I applied modular architecture and used Retrofit, RxJava, Dagger, Coroutine, and ROOM to implement word translation functions and manage favorite items.
One of the key elements of the project was the use of multi-modularity (Multi-Module). Thanks to this approach, the code was organized into independent modules, which provided a more flexible creation and support of the project.
Pressure diary (09.2022 - 11.2022)
During the project development I implemented features such as working with time (date), theme switching (light/dark), user authentication, data grouping for specific screens, using Floating Action Button (FAB), menu handling, sending messages through the bottom menu (app sharing), using enum classes, subscribing to changes and adding real-time data, working with graphical representation of measurements (charts), working with font styles, and integration with a cloud service.

android,"Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to engage in a vast array of projects, task types, kinds of teams within various organizational approaches and methodologies.
Most of my career has been spent in mobile development for Android. The first version of Android I started working with was 2.1. I had the opportunity to trace the entire evolution of the OS from a programmer's perspective, starting from the times when AsyncTask seemed like a good idea, and real-time image processing required writing code using the NDK, to the advent of Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform. It would be correct to say that I have worked with all the paradigms that have ever been widely used for Android.
I have tackled a very broad spectrum of tasks, from complex algorithmic problems, apps with sophisticated client-side data processing, to ""layout development"", high-load multithreaded applications, and of course, animations, animations, and a bit more animations. My experience includes designing architecture from scratch as well as gradually integrating new architecture into very large projects along with writing features. Also covered the entire spectrum of code testing approaches, from projects without any testing to those that applied a comprehensive range of tests (unit, integration, hermetic, and even units for Activities & Fragments). And, of course, there was a lot of code review.
I have extensive experience working with teams of 1 to 50+ members, both remotely and in-office, in product and outsourcing settings.
Programming Languages: Java, Kotlin, Dart, C++
Technologies and libraries: Android SDK, Flutter SDK, Material Design 3, widgets, JSON, SQL, REST, Gradle, MVP, MVVM, Retrofit, RxJava, Mockito, Robolectric, Espresso, Dagger 2, Data binding, Clean architecture, RxJava, Dagger/Hilt. Understanding of OOP principles, knowledge of design patterns, data structures, multithreading and synchronization principles, SQLite and ORM, performance and memory optimization skills, big experience in developing client-server applications, code review and quality analysis, UI animations, data transfer protocols, knowledge of json and xml formats, knowledges in image recognition methods, extensive knowledge in data compression.
I want to describe a few of my successful and interesting cases:
- My first experience in non-commercial programming involved developing data compression algorithms and their implementation. At the beginning of my professional career in a department specializing in image recognition, I was charged with developing a proprietary barcode format and to be able to recognize and encode data in it (at that time, QR codes were not yet represented on mobile devices).
- GrubHub project, which adhered to extremely high standards of code quality and control including tests of all types, stringent coding standards and very detailed code review processes.
- Some of my own projects that I am currently working on. Without disclosing the details of the projects, I can say that a special emphasis was placed on design and a convenient, consistent interface. This required a very detailed study of the subject area and analysis of the last two versions of Material Design.
Choosing a project the following criteria are important for me: Interesting project, good team, salary level."
