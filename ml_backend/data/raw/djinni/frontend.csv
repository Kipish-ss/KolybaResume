- deepen my knowledge of the backend side of the development process;
- Created (chose the technology stack, built an ""architecture"", was the main contributor to the codebase) the client side of a rather big administration platform designed to administer, score and report on the extensive range of occupational assessments and solutions.

frontend,"Over the past two years, I’ve been working on personal and team-based web development projects that helped me grow as a strong junior Vue.js developer. One of the key projects I’ve built is a custom CMS system using Vue.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The system allows users to create, edit, and manage content with authentication, markdown support, and user roles. I implemented RESTful APIs, component-based UI with Vue 3 + Composition API, and styled it with TailwindCSS. On the backend, I used FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and JWT for secure login and data handling. The codebase is modular and follows clean architecture principles.
In other projects on my GitHub, I’ve also explored building a restaurant table booking system and a gift list tracker — both using Vue.js and integrating third-party APIs. My current role in teams has usually been as a frontend or full stack developer, responsible for implementing UI, connecting APIs, debugging, and improving UX.
I am currently focused on improving my testing practices (unit and e2e), performance optimization in Vue apps, and deepening my backend knowledge in FastAPI and databases. I enjoy building real-world apps and always strive to write clean, scalable code and contribute actively to team discussions and architecture planning."

Our team created a publishing platform that consists of 10 websites with 9 million monthly users, focusing on efficient monetization while prioritizing user experience and performance metrics. Additionally, we developed an all-in-one admin panel with essential publishing tools for maintaining this platform.
During this time, my main responsibilities included migrating the websites from Jquery to Next.js and TypeScript, creating architecture for increasing the number of sites from 3 to 10 with custom designs, researching and evaluating new technologies and practices for performance improvement, and creating a solution for an all-in-one admin panel with the ability to independently deploy each part of it. I also wrote Node.js services on the admin panels, such as a WebSocket service for providing online article editing for multiple users.
In addition to my technical responsibilities, I also managed a frontend team of 5 members, creating personal goals for them that aligned with our overall business goals., managed their skills and career growth, and participated in decompositions and estimations in close communication with stakeholders and other team leads.
Before joining this team, I worked on e-commerce, healthcare, and recruitment projects using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Redux, Jquery, and even custom frameworks. This gave me experience with other Frontend technologies and business models.

Recently I had a nice experience in working with AJAX on WordPress. The task was to make a page with custom posts. ""Nothing is easier!"", I thought. And really, displaying posts with pagination using WP_Query() and paginate_links() is not a rocket science. But! The matter was that according to design, I had to display different amount of posts on different width of the screen. So, that's why I needed to implement AJAX into my work: I calculated the amount of posts according to the screen width and made a request to the server to get the appropriate amount of the posts. To make the pagination work, I made a request to the page number (not a link!), so when the user clicked on the page, the server responded the number of the page with the relevant posts, without reloading the page.

frontend,"Я студент, поки що не працював у компаніях і не займався фрілансом, проте маю досвід роботи над двома навчальними проєктами.
Перший проєкт я створював із використанням 3D-бібліотеки. Мені сподобався цей досвід, адже він дав змогу попрактикуватися з інтерактивною графікою, але я вирішив зосередитися на звичайній фронтенд-розробці без використання подібних бібліотек. Під час роботи над проєктом я паралельно вивчав основи HTML, CSS і JavaScript.
Другий проєкт — це сайт на тему космосу, у якому я заглибився в адаптивний дизайн, анімації та створення інтерактивного контенту, працюючи з HTML, CSS і JavaScript.
Зараз я прагну розвиватися у фронтенд-розробці, вдосконалюючи свої знання JavaScript і вивчаючи сучасні інструменти, зокрема Angular і React. Моєю метою є отримання практичного досвіду в реальних проєктах і розвиток як професіонала у командній роботі.
- Завершив два навчальні проєкти, які допомогли закріпити знання HTML, CSS, і JavaScript.
- Самостійно освоїв основи веброзробки, включно з HTML, CSS і JavaScript, та планую в майбутньому заглибитися у вивчення сучасних фреймворків Angular і React.

frontend,"In my previous role as a Frontend Engineer, I worked on a variety of projects, primarily focused on building and maintaining large-scale Angular applications.
One of the key projects I worked on involved migrating a legacy Backbone.JS app to Angular 14. This migration required reworking major components, optimizing performance, and ensuring the app remained scalable as we added new features.
The key technologies used were Angular, TypeScript, RxJS,  with a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code.

frontend,"Learning platform – it’s a project for my work MAN (Small Academy of Sciences).
The educational platform allows you to create various tasks, attach educational materials to them, and set a due date for these tasks if you are a teacher. It also allows you to view the list of tasks, submit tasks, and view educational materials if you are a student.
I used HTML to create site blocks like class page, class blocks, tasks in those classes.
JS is the main programming language on my site, and because of it my site can react to the actions of the user. HTML cant react, for example when user pressing a button or sending a form, and this is exactly what I use JS for.
Thanks to the Nunjucks templater, I don’t have to create a new file every time, it allows to generate elements dynamically. In addition, on my site, the teacher generates classes and tasks, and I dont know how many there will be, so I need dynamic generation, which Nunjucks does wery well.
My website also has a design. CSS was used to write styles because the design of the site no less important than the content.
Databases are probably the hardest part of my site. Beacouse of databases, I can store data about the user, and it allow me to create a separation between the teacher and the student, and show the student one part of the site and the teacher another.  All tasks, assessments, information about students are also stored in the databases.

frontend,"Працюючи на останньому місці роботи, я отримав завдання кардинально переробити внутрішній веб‑додаток, який вже не відповідав сучасним вимогам компанії. Необхідно було створити новий веб‑додаток з нуля, який забезпечував би покращену оптимізацію, високу продуктивність та сучасний інтерфейс і функціонал. Переді мною постало завдання спроектувати повну архітектуру, розробити як фронтенд – з реалізацією нового інтерфейсу, так і бекенд – створити сервер та базу даних, і забезпечити інтеграцію з 1С. Це все здійснювалося завдяки тісній співпраці з дизайнером інтерфейсів та 1С‑програмістом.
Основні задачі:
- Бекенд. Розробляв серверну частину з використанням Node.js та Express.js на TypeScript, забезпечуючи ефективну обробку запитів і інтеграцію з базою даних;
- Фронтенд. Створював інтерфейс користувача на ReactJS з використанням Material UI для сучасного оформлення, а також використовував Redux Toolkit
для управління станом додатку;
- Дизайн. Дизайн інтерфейсу було розроблено професійним дизайнером. Я створював додаток згідно з наданим дизайном і активно обговорював його
деталі;
- База даних. Проектував базу даних на основі PostgreSQL.
- Інтеграція. Тісно співпрацював із 1С‑програмістом для організації взаємодії з базою даних 1С, що дозволяло отримувати необхідні запити для бекенду;
- Контроль версій та документація. Використовував GitHub для контролю версій, проводив тестування додатку з використанням Jest та створював
документацію з допомогою Swagger для підтримки процесу розробки;
Завдяки цілісному підходу до проектування архітектури, тісній співпраці з дизайнером і ефективному використанню сучасних технологій, вдалося досягти значного покращення продуктивності та якості розроблюваного веб‑додатку.
До початку цієї роботи 2 роки працював комерційно на фрілансі, та виконував різноманітні замовлення зі створення як фронтенду, так і бекенду для різних, не надто складних цілей. В основному проекти реалізовувались для студентів вузів та знайомих.
Очікування
Шукаю компанію з цікавими проектами, де зможу застосувати свої знання для вирішення складних задач та професійного росту. Хочу працювати дистанційно. Я готовий запропонувати свою повну віддачу і стати приємним і дружнім доповненням до вашої команди.
Чого не хочу
Не хочу працювати в середовищі з надмірною бюрократією, де процеси заважають швидкому та ефективному виконанню задач. Також не зацікавлений у проектах, які не передбачають можливості професійного розвитку та застосування сучасних технологій."

frontend,"My experience in project development comes from my time at RS School courses. We worked on a variety of projects, which didn't have strict execution guidelines, so we had to come up with solutions ourselves. As a result, all projects were unique and not copied from elsewhere. We initially used JavaScript as our tech stack, then transitioned smoothly to TypeScript, and concluded our final project using React. All my work is available on my GitHub.
There are no achievements in the field of web development yet, I’m just learning.
For now, I want to continue learning and growing. Over the course of a year of studying, I've come to realize that knowledge is constantly evolving, and one must not stop learning. Therefore, I desire a job that offers continuous development opportunities. I understand that beginners are often given simple and uninteresting tasks, but I wouldn't want to spend too much time refactoring legacy code."

frontend,"In my recent projects, I’ve focused on building fullstack web applications, with a growing emphasis on improving my frontend skills. One of the main projects is Birdie, a minimalist social network built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, where I explored modern UI patterns, responsive design, and accessible components using shadcn/ui. I also integrated features like authentication with Clerk and image uploads with uploadthing, deploying the application through Vercel.
Previously, I contributed to the development of a web-based educational tool for teaching Test Smells refactoring, where I worked with Vue.js on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. During my time as a fullstack developer at the Núcleo de Práticas em Informática (NPI), I was involved in several projects using React, TypeScript, and SQL, gaining hands-on experience in frontend development within agile teams.
Although I’ve worked across the stack, my current focus is on mastering frontend technologies, particularly in creating clean, accessible, and performant UIs. I'm also aiming to improve in areas like component architecture, design systems, and frontend testing to deliver more robust and polished user experiences.
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on impactful projects, contribute to published research, and build a solid foundation as a software engineer. I graduated with a degree in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), where I developed not only technical skills but also a strong problem-solving mindset.
During my time at university, I was a scholarship holder in a technological development program, where I collaborated on the creation of a web platform to teach refactoring of Test Smells. This work led to the publication of two research papers, marking a significant milestone in my academic career and reinforcing my ability to bridge theory and practice.
I also worked as a fullstack developer at the Núcleo de Práticas em Informática (NPI), where I participated in the development of real-world applications used within the university. This experience sharpened my skills in frontend and backend technologies such as React, TypeScript, SQL, and Java with Spring Boot, while applying agile methodologies and working collaboratively in a team environment.
Additionally, I’ve been actively building personal projects like Birdie, a minimalist social network built with Next.js, React, and other modern tools. These projects have allowed me to explore and apply cutting-edge technologies, deepen my frontend expertise, and improve deployment practices using platforms like Vercel and Docker.
Looking back, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made — from publishing research to shipping functional software — and I’m excited to continue evolving as a developer by working on challenging projects, learning from others, and staying up to date with the latest in web development.
In a work environment, I value clarity, collaboration, and continuous learning. I hope to be part of a team where people are open to sharing knowledge, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and working together toward meaningful goals. I appreciate transparency in communication, well-defined expectations, and a culture where curiosity and improvement are encouraged — both on a personal and technical level.
I look for a place where I can grow as a developer, contribute to real challenges, and feel that my work has impact. It's important to me to have space to experiment, propose ideas, and feel trusted to take ownership of tasks. A team that values clean code, thoughtful design, and a good user experience aligns well with the way I like to work.
On the other hand, I don’t thrive in environments with poor communication, excessive micromanagement, or a lack of direction. I also try to avoid workplaces where there's little room for learning, innovation, or where people are treated as interchangeable parts instead of professionals with potential and individual goals.
Ultimately, I want to be in a place where there’s mutual respect, room to grow, and pride in building quality software."

My academic background lies in robotics and mechatronics. However, I transitioned into software development, a field which I found to offer greater flexibility and the freedom to work remotely with minimal bureaucratic hurdles.
At the inception of my career, I was plunged into a substantial project with no prior documentation – an experience akin to navigating the vast ocean having only just learned to swim in a pool. This experience proved to be an invaluable catalyst in my growth as a developer. It fostered my proficiency in frontend development, and enabled me to gain a comprehensive understanding of architectural design. It also honed my skills in optimizing how an application is constructed and scaled. In addition to these, my professional journey has been enriched by my exposure to .NET Core development, SQL, and the MERN stack.
I am driven by my enthusiasm for engaging with emerging technologies within a project that champions robust and consistent architecture. My commitment to crafting clean, maintainable code enables me to not only deliver on project features, but to also build a well-structured, easily adaptable, and scalable framework. I meticulously strive to achieve low coupling and high cohesion, maintaining a clear separation of logic from views.
In my pursuit of contemporary and efficient practices, I consciously steer clear of jQuery and older versions of React that employ outdated patterns. I am equally discerning in avoiding architecture that mirrors the cluttered complexity of an unstructured environment. My goal is to always stay abreast of the latest advancements, ensuring I deliver the highest quality software solutions."

frontend,"I have worked on various innovative projects. One notable project was the development of a CLI tool to convert any file to a video and vice versa. I implemented this tool multiple times in different languages, starting with Python using Numpy and later in Rust for better performance. The Python version utilized the HFYU lossless codec, while the Rust version employed 8-bit GIFs, which included metadata frames to store the hash, frame count, and encoder version. This approach ensured file integrity during the conversion process and facilitated progress tracking and validation. Despite the inherent challenges related to video encoding stability and performance optimization, the Rust implementation significantly improved the tool's speed and efficiency.
In another significant project, I redesigned and optimized an existing PHP-based service request calendar for a corporate website. This involved creating a Rust wrapper to handle and parse HTML responses from the PHP server, which lacked structured identifiers. This task required extracting data from skewed tables and other unstructured formats. I am currently developing tests for this system, building a server to interface with the Rust library, and creating a React Native application to provide mobile access. These improvements have enhanced the user interface and performance, leading to a more efficient workflow for managing service requests.
Throughout these projects, I have utilized a range of technologies and methodologies, including Python, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Numpy, React Native, CLI development, HTML parsing, video encoding, test-driven development, performance optimization, and UI/UX design

I also appreciate a supportive work culture that encourages work-life balance, respect for diverse ideas, and professional growth.

I prefer to avoid a work environment that is rigid or lacks room for creativity and growth. I am not interested in roles where there is limited collaboration or where feedback and professional development are not prioritized.

З часом я зрозумів, що технології, якими я володію, стають нудними для мене, і я вирішив знову спробувати вивчити щось нове.
Я чув раніше про різні фреймворки, та бібліотеки для вдосконалення (Багато з них і для спрощення) роботи з JavaScript, React Js є однією з них, ну звичайно ж я почав її вивчати.
Після кількох місяців навчання, я вирішив випробувати також фреймворк React Native, дізнавшись, що він майже ідентичний, але як пізніше виявилося, що це зовсім не так, хіба що в плані синтаксису JSX :)
Згодом створив парочку комерційних додатків на React Native, і парочку стартапів на React`і

frontend,"Hi,
I am a Senior React/TypeScript developer with over 6 years of corporate experience. Also, I had a small project for a few years before I started officially in IT. Owning a product that gains money I obtained many valuable skills, such as leadership, negotiation with partners, contractors, and employees, conflict solving, strategy vision, and others.
As an official experience, I have a proven track record of leading development from idea to release, architecting scalable solutions, and driving business efficiency.
I developed expertise in optimizing performance, solving difficult problems, mentoring developers, and collaborating with stakeholders to deliver high-impact projects.
I seek a role to leverage my technical skills and leadership experience to drive team success and reach new heights.
My next goal is a Tech lead role, which I consider most preferable for my mindset, skillset, and expertise.
I built myself as a strong person packing with great soft skills, including leadership and responsibilities, valuable in leading positions. My vision is strong enough to be very proactive and initiate. And I started a lot of changes near me, like improving the time management of the team, creating growth plans for less experienced colleagues, tight team collaboration, and tools decisions.
My first expectation is a healthy environment in the team or the ability to make changes that way. The second one is a place where I can grow into a Tech Lead in the future, or the closest one."

frontend,"Since 8th grade, when I started attending the Regional Small Academy of Sciences, I have been introduced to programming.
What did I start with? A kid, who loves engineering sciences, picked C++ as its introductory language.
After a few years of learning, I attended the Lviv Polytechnic National University on the computer sciences faculty. There, I was introduced to other programming languages and learned algorithms, systems, approaches, and types of programming. When I realized that I was ready and that the material taught was not enough, I decided to attend EPAM courses. Have been attending those for 6 months, after which I earned the status of Trainee and started working, but the war has begun. My plans went sideways, and after a while, I realized that I couldn’t sit in despair and that I needed to grow, so I got a Trainee position in another company.
Here, I faced multiple challenges: I’ve worked with Angular, React, vanilla JS, worked with a plethora of projects ranging from CRM to game dev, migrated Ionic, supported existing projects, talked tet-a-tet with clients, solved different kinds of issues, but have realized that my current position does not cover my growth requirements now.
As a person who always strives to learn new things, I started feeling like I’ve started to stagnate and am looking for professional growth. I like teamwork, my soft skills are at an all-time high, there is no person I cannot have a conversation with. Open and honest relationships are my priority. I am proactive and easily adapt to changes. I have a lot of experience conversing with clients and a great conversational English level. And, most importantly, I have a can-do mindset.
Successfully developed two critical modules for the network portal, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement.
Implemented user interfaces following design specifications and wireframes, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams to understand project requirements and deliver solutions on time and within budget.
Proactively identified and addressed bugs, performance issues, and other technical challenges, reducing system downtime by 15%.
Provided crucial support for existing functionality written in AngularJS, resulting in a 30% improvement in system stability.
Developed new features in Angular using NgRx, enhancing overall system efficiency.
Designed and implemented algorithmic methods, leading to a 25% reduction in processing time for critical business processes.

frontend,"I have successfully completed two significant projects: developing a company website and a Back Office (Office Automation) application. In these, I was instrumental in designing the frontend user experience and ensuring seamless backend integration using technologies like Next.js.
In my current role, I lead frontend development tasks and collaborate closely with backend developers to implement features effectively. To broaden my expertise, I have started exploring backend development to deepen my understanding of server-side programming.
To transition into a full-stack developer role, I am actively learning additional backend frameworks and databases, to complement my frontend expertise. I also focus on enhancing my problem-solving skills and software architecture knowledge to tackle complex challenges across the full development stack, aiming to contribute meaningfully to all phases of the software development lifecycle. In addition I have experience  designing UI/UX in Figma and Adobe XD.
I accomplished several projects such as Company website and Office automation application and other group projects.
What I want from work is a dynamic and collaborative environment where I can continuously learn and grow as a developer. I value opportunities to work on challenging projects that allow me to apply and expand my skills, both on the frontend and backend. Additionally, I seek a supportive team culture where knowledge sharing and mentorship are encouraged, enabling me to thrive and contribute meaningfully to the success of the team and the organization as a whole.
Conversely, something I don't want from work is stagnation and monotony. I'm motivated by engaging tasks and a stimulating work environment, so I hope to avoid roles that limit my ability to learn and innovate. Additionally, I aim to steer clear of toxic work cultures that hinder collaboration and personal development. Instead, I aspire to be part of a team that fosters creativity, values individual growth, and embraces continuous improvement."

frontend,"I have worked on several projects involving both frontend development and team collaboration. One key project was building a responsive e-commerce website where I implemented product listing pages, shopping cart functionality, and user authentication. I was also involved in redesigning the UI for a company dashboard, focusing on improving user experience and accessibility.
For these projects, I primarily used:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript for structure and interactivity
* React.js for building reusable components and managing state
* Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
* Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
* Figma for working with design mockups
* Firebase for backend services like authentication and database
* Jira for tracking tasks and progress
As a frontend developer, I’ve focused extensively on self-training, working through projects that include building responsive websites and web apps using React, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I've gained practical experience with React Hooks, Tailwind CSS, and Version Control (Git). Additionally, I have mentored peers and newcomers in frontend technologies, guiding them through coding challenges and helping them understand best practices. This mentoring role has allowed me to strengthen my communication skills and solidify my own understanding of core concepts. I continue to challenge myself with new projects to improve my skills, with a particular focus on state management, testing, and performance optimization.
I am looking for a role that provides opportunities for continuous learning and growth, where I can apply my frontend skills while being challenged with more complex projects. I want to work in an environment that values collaboration, creativity, and mentorship, allowing me to expand my technical knowledge and leadership skills.

On the other hand, I would prefer to avoid roles with limited growth potential or those that lack a clear path for career advancement. I am also not interested in positions that focus solely on repetitive tasks with little room for innovation or skill development."

frontend,"Я маю значний досвід роботи в розробці веб-сайтів та веб-додатків, використовуючи сучасні технології та інструменти. Мої ключові навички включають роботу з HTML, CSS та JavaScript, а також з такими популярними фреймворками та бібліотеками, як React, Vue, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Vuex, тощо...
Я розробив безліч проектів, включаючи адаптивні веб-сайти та односторінкові додатки (SPA). У процесі розробки я використовую систему контролю версій Git/GitHub та працюю з менеджерами пакетів, такими як npm та yarn. Також я володію навичками роботи з дизайнерськими інструментами, такими як Figma та Photoshop.
Крім того, я маю досвід роботи з GatsbyJS, Netlify та Netlify CMS, що дозволяє мені створювати високопродуктивні та безпечні веб-сайти з динамічним контентом. Мій професійний досвід у веб-розробці налічує один рік роботи як фрілансера.
Я вмію створювати веб-сайти, використовуючи HTML та сучасний фреймворк React, що дозволяє мені розробляти як статичні, так і односторінкові додатки. Я глибоко розумію роботу з React та принципи роботи Redux. Крім того, я опанував Vue та Vuex, що розширює мої можливості як веб-розробника.
Мій практичний досвід включає інтеграцію веб-сайтів з популярною CMS WordPress та роботу з конструктором сторінок Elementor. Я виконував завдання, пов’язані з налаштуванням хостингу, підключенням до бази даних та забезпеченням коректної роботи веб-ресурсів.
Я зарекомендував себе як відповідальний та грамотний веб-розробник, здатний якісно виконувати роботу та дотримуватися встановлених термінів.
Мої численні досягнення відображають багатогранність моїх умінь, наполегливість у досягненні цілей та прагнення до постійного вдосконалення. Універсальність - одна з моїх визначних рис. Я володію широким спектром практичних навичок, що охоплюють ремонт електроніки, побутових приладів та обладнання промислового призначення. Сфера будівництва, сантехнічні роботи, монтаж стель та облицювання стін гіпсокартоном - це завдання, з якими я справляюся на достойному рівні, демонструючи високу кваліфікацію та оперативність.
Міцний фундамент моїх досягнень було закладено ще в шкільні роки, коли я отримав почесне звання ""Кращий учень школи"" завдяки активній участі в її житті та прагненню зробити її кращою. Також я захопився туризмом і разом зі шкільною командою займав призові місця на змаганнях з розбиття табору, подолання перешкод, водного туризму, в'язання вузлів, орієнтування за картою та компасом, а також розв'язування головоломок.
Творчість та акторська майстерність - мої великі пристрасті. У студентські роки я гастролював містами зі своєю театральною трупою, ставлячи різноманітні вистави. Наші вистави часто вигравали гран-прі та перші місця на конкурсах і фестивалях, які я також організовував. Я відповідально ставився до координації учасників з різних міст, забезпечуючи їхнє розміщення, супровід та проведення екскурсій.
Безцінний досвід я здобув, працюючи три роки інтерв'юером та беручи участь в організації екзитполів в Україні. Під час опитувань на політичні теми я навчився ефективно спілкуватися з різними категоріями людей - від адекватних до тих, чия поведінка значно відхилялася від загальноприйнятих норм. Незважаючи на непрості обставини, я завжди вмів отримати необхідну інформацію.
Програмування я опановую самостійно, долаючи труднощі зусиллями та наполегливою працею.
Хоча можуть бути прогалини у знаннях, я впевнений у здатності знайти рішення будь-якої задачі. Самовдосконалення та готовність до нових викликів - мої життєві принципи, що дозволяють мені досягати успіхів у різних сферах діяльності.
Нормальний, дружній колектив з хорошими взаєминами та здоровою атмосферою в команді. Щоб було комфортно працювати, панувала взаємоповага та підтримка.
Гідну оплату праці відповідно до навичок, досвіду та докладених зусиль.
Можливості для професійного розвитку та кар'єрного зростання. Цікаві проєкти, навчання, підвищення кваліфікації.
Гнучкий графік або віддалений формат роботи за потреби. Баланс між роботою та особистим життям.
А от чого точно не хочу:
Токсичної атмосфери, постійних конфліктів та непрофесіоналізму в колективі.
Завищених вимог та нереалістичних дедлайнів, що спричиняють стрес.
Рутинної, нудної роботи без викликів та можливостей для розвитку.
Жорсткого мікроменеджменту та контролю кожного кроку."

Performance Optimization and Quality Assurance"
frontend,"I’ve worked on various projects ranging from small websites to larger web applications. My tasks included developing responsive user interfaces, implementing interactive elements with React, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. I have experience using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Currently, I’m the sole frontend developer on my team, responsible for the entire frontend development process, from planning to deployment. I collaborate closely with designers and backend developers to ensure smooth integration and high-quality user experiences.
As for my career growth, I’d like to focus on deepening my expertise in TypeScript and Next.js while expanding my knowledge of backend technologies to become a full-stack developer.
One of my key achievements was significantly improving the performance of a large web application at my previous job. By optimizing the frontend code, implementing lazy loading, and reducing the size of assets, I was able to decrease the page load time. This resulted in a better user experience, especially on mobile devices, and contributed to higher engagement and retention.
My main expectation from a job is to work on challenging and meaningful projects that allow me to grow both technically and professionally. I’m looking for an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of TypeScript and Next.js, as well as to expand my skills in backend development to eventually become a full-stack developer. I value a collaborative team environment where open communication and knowledge sharing are encouraged.
On the other hand, I’m not interested in roles where there’s little room for growth or where I’m restricted to only repetitive tasks without the opportunity to learn new technologies or solve complex problems. I also prefer a healthy work-life balance and would rather avoid roles that demand excessive overtime or unrealistic expectations."

Idealy, I am expecting flexible working hours."
frontend,"HMI (Human Machine Interface)
This is a web application for drawing graphic shapes, diagrams, and charts directly in the browser using HTML5 Canvas. I worked on improving this project and fixed over 15 critical bugs to ensure everything runs stably and without glitches. The toughest challenges I tackled:
Created a custom color palette — I dug into Canvas JS to make the colors change dynamically and be easy to select.
Set up gradients via HTML5 Canvas — I had to tweak the settings to ensure smooth transitions without sacrificing performance.
Built a radio button shape — this was tricky because it required precise mathematical calculations for positioning and interaction with other elements.
Admin Panel (CRM for Phone Financing)
This is a system for managing clients, payments, and phone loans, which I built from scratch using React, Material UI, and Firebase. I designed the entire UI — it turned out clean and user-friendly. I made it responsive so it looks great and works well on both desktops and mobile devices: tables, buttons — everything adapts to the screen size. Plus, I set up the core logic: data saving, updating, and list filtering. I used Firebase for the database and real-time functionality.
Participated in code reviews — reviewed colleagues’ code, gave feedback, and improved my own code based on their suggestions.
Worked on optimization — sped up loading times and removed unnecessary elements so users wouldn’t have to wait.
Collaborated with the team, discussed tasks, and suggested ideas for improvements.
Quickly climbed the career ladder: after completing courses, I immediately found a job. The project was very specific and my first one on Angular. I managed to quickly learn everything and start tackling tasks. All the tasks in the project were at a middle level, requiring proper attention, mathematics, and optimizations. I migrated an existing project from a custom state manager to NgRx."

frontend,"Hi everyone!
I am a talented, detail-oriented and self-motivated Web Developer, with extensive experience (5 years) in front-end website building.
I have successfully completed 100+ projects and logged 3200+ hours on Upwork. I am grateful to all the clients who chose me, their gratitude is the greatest joy for me.
I enjoy spending my time helping others create their ideal WordPress / Shopify/WooCommerce customizations. Since early 2019, I have been granted various tasks of customizing websites that use WordPress / WooCommerce in some way, shape, or form. From the most intricate instances of code, to simple HTML modifications, there is seldom an issue that I cannot solve, or at least get you on the right track!
Being full-time supporting the needs and wants of my customers allows me to be creative and set the bar extremely high. Utilizing many resources, to include a design team of specialists, no matter the size of the task, let's talk about it and get you set up for success the right way.
My goal is to produce responsive and beautiful designs for the web while learning new technologies that allow me to develop unique and innovative websites
I'm a friendly guy and I am always open to challenges and ready to find solutions for a better web experience. Feel free to contact me!
In the contact section, you can find a link to my Upwork profile, where I have over 3200 hours of work and 100+ well-completed projects.
I will be happy to send you examples of projects I have created upon request
I expect that working for the company will not only be a source of income but also a place where I can develop my professional skills and personal qualities.
Corporate culture:
A positive corporate culture is important to me, where every employee feels valued and involved in the process. I like it when the team has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere, mutual respect and support.
Work-life balance:
I plan to work in a company that respects personal time and provides a work schedule or the possibility of remote work. I'm ready to work on weekends or outside of working hours when the client has changed the deadline or the designer has delivered the design late, but this should not become a habit.
Professional development:
I would be happy if the company provided opportunities for learning and professional growth, such as trainings, courses, and the opportunity to work on different projects. I like it when 20-30 percent of my work is star projects/tasks.
Compensation and benefits:
I expect a competitive salary that matches my skills and experience, a social package would be a nice bonus, but not a criterion for a user-employer.
Innovation and technology:
I would like to work for a company that has its finger on the pulse of its industry and follows the news, open to innovation.
Social responsibility:
It is important to me that valuable companies are in harmony with their owners. I appreciate when a company makes a positive contribution to society whenever possible.
Work should bring satisfaction and contribute to personal growth."

frontend,"During my work, I worked on the development of financial monitoring software for banking and non-banking institutions.
I actively interacted with the backend using the REST API.
I used such technologies as TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, React, AntDesign, axios, React hook form, and adaptive layout.
For communication, our team used: Trello, OpenProject, Google meet
Together with my friend who developed the design, we have created perhaps the first unique product that will help you and your friends to be always ready for new challenges, and that is “Be ready”.
“Be ready” is a project that offers a set of functionality such as:
- Adding friends
- Creating a list of necessary things in the campaign
- Predict situations in the style of “What if no one took a tent?”
You can create both your own list and one recommended by us. You can also save the list and use it in future trips, or you can simply share it with friends.
You can view which of your friends is taking this or that item and in what quantity.
All this is accompanied by a simple, clear and pleasant interface and fast usage.
When developing the technical part, I used the following technologies: TypeScript, React, TanSctack Query, Formik, React-router-dom, firebase, Vite, Vite-plugin-pwa.

I am a Junior Frontend Developer skilled in HTML, CSS, JS, and React, with hands-on experience following Scrum methodology while collaborating within a team. I excel in delivering high-quality, responsive websites and thrive in team settings, bringing ideas to life. Committed to continuous professional growth, I actively acquire new skills to advance my career.
Project Experience:
Pet projects:
- Todo list(React, Redux Toolkit, styled-componets)-In this project, I implemented task management features, including adding, deleting, editing, and marking tasks as completed. I integrated the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch tasks and added pagination along with local storage for data persistence. The application was styled using styled-components to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design.
- Phonebook - (React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI) - It features a user-friendly interface designed with a focus on user experience. The backend API handles CRUD operations for managing contacts, while third-party services, such as email notifications, are integrated for enhanced functionality. User authentication is implemented using JWT for secure access to resources, and the application supports fetching, updating, and deleting contacts through a RESTful API. The UI is styled using Material-UI components to ensure a modern and responsive design.
Team projects:
- Water Tracker (React Router, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI):
Website was developed with React Router for navigation and Redux Toolkit for state management. In the project I was responsible for developing a modal for user settings, a dark-light theme switcher, and a development server setup. Implemented routing between pages and components to ensure smooth navigation and a user-friendly experience.
- BookShelf (HTML, CSS, JS):
Website was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to easily discover and organize their preferred books. In the project I was focused on developing the shopping list section to help users add and manage books they wish to buy.
I have some achievements in study development:
- I have several own pet-projects demonstrating strong problem-solving skills, independent research, and the ability to integrate various web technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB;
- Creating responsive applications, according to the finished layout;
- Developed a basket for the ""BookShelf"" website with interaction with local storage and pagination;
- Acted as a Tech Lead on a team project, coordinating team efforts, reviewing code, and ensuring the project was completed on time and met the quality standards.
- Successfully created the Phonebook project, a full-stack application that allows users to manage contacts. Implemented user authentication using JWT, integrated MongoDB for data storage, and deployed the application on a cloud platform (Render).

Я виділю комплексну задачу, яка була в мене на етапі, коли я працював Full-stack розробником. У мене була задача створити кабінет зі складною системою аналітики. Необхідно було так зробити, щоб розрахунок проводився на основі даних з різних таблиць. Сам sql-запит включав в себе підзапити до різних таблиць. Також після цього інформацію необхідно було обробляти таким чином, щоб можна було зручно її сортувати по різним фільтрам. Калькуляція аналітики був складним і займав багато часу. І кожна зміна фільтру починала весь розрахунок заново. Необхідно було зробити так, щоб система видавала відповідь майже миттєво.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

frontend,"У 42 роки я прийняв рішення повністю зануритися у свою пристрасть до веб-розробки і ніколи не озирався назад. Після більш ніж 20 років роботи у сфері продажів, управління та розвитку бізнесу я переключився на новий і захопливий кар'єрний шлях - той, який пов'язаний з моєю довічною любов'ю до технологій.
Наразі я працюю позаштатним веб-розробником (фрілансером), спеціалізуючись здебільшого на розробці HTML/CSS, JavaScript і WordPress. Мої проекти варіюються від створення сайтів з нуля на основі специфікації дизайну до роботи з популярними конструкторами сторінок, такими як Elementor. Я завжди прагну дізнатися більше і бути попереду в цій галузі, яка швидко розвивається, тому зараз я занурююся в React, прагнучи перейти на роль React-розробника і, врешті-решт, на позицію MERN з повним стеком.
Мій професійний шлях до веб-розробки дав мені ключові сильні сторони: сильні навички розв'язання проблем, лідерство і глибоке розуміння бізнес-операцій. Від управління відділом продажів зі 100 співробітників до керівництва переворотом логістичних і торгових операцій цілого регіону, я послідовно забезпечував зростання та інновації. Я знаю, як мотивувати команди, оптимізувати процеси та досягати амбітних цілей.
Сьогодні я привношу ту саму відданість і прагнення у веб-розробку. Я пристрасно бажаю об'єднати свої технічні знання та досвід керівництва, щоб створювати цифрові рішення, які дійсно впливають. Я з нетерпінням чекаю нових можливостей для зростання як розробника і внесення внеску в динамічний, перспективний розвиток компанії."

frontend,"Story Book Application
Full-Stack Developer Role using Nodejs, Typescript, Express, MongoDB, Reactjs, Typescript, TailwindCSS, React Query, and Redux Toolkit.
Ideology: A client has expressed a vision for an online reading platform that enables users to access books for reading purposes. Each book is offered in both digital and hardcopy formats, with the digital price set at a lower rate than that of the hardcopy edition. Upon purchasing a digital book, users are permitted to read it online. Conversely, a purchase of the hardcopy version allows the user to download the book. Due to constraints in available resources, the client opted to prioritize the implementation of the digital purchase feature at this stage, with the intention of introducing the hardcopy option as a future enhancement. Consequently, the platform currently facilitates online reading exclusively for users who have purchased books in digital format. In Addition, an admin dashboard to upload books and their content and also keep track of users and their activities.
Project architecture: The proposed project encompassed the implementation of a comprehensive solution utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, React Query, and Redux Toolkit for the front end, alongside a robust backend developed in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Additionally, the project leveraged several third-party packages, including Google Auth for authentication, PDF Parse, PDF-Lib, Mammoth, and Tesseract.js. These tools enabled the systematic processing of PDFs uploaded by the administrator within the dashboard, allowing for the decomposition of these documents into chapters accessible to users. Furthermore, a manual authentication system was established, requiring users to log in using their email and password.
Challenges:
The client sought a comprehensive and modern software application solution while operating within limited resources. Given that the project involved handling images and the storage of substantial file content, particularly PDF documents, a typical approach would involve the use of an AWS S3 bucket for both image and file storage. However, in light of the budgetary constraints, I implemented an alternative solution utilizing Firebase for image hosting and employed Multer GridFS storage along with MongoDB for content storage. This approach effectively accommodated the client's financial limitations while still fulfilling project requirements."

frontend,"As a student, I developed myself in the field of Front-end development through participation in various educational projects and completing interesting tasks. One of my first projects involved creating a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned the basics of HTML to create the structure of web pages, CSS to provide styles, and JavaScript to add interactivity.
Later on, I started using the React library to build more complex and dynamic web applications. With React, I could effectively manage the application state and reuse components, which significantly simplified the development and maintenance of projects.
I also studied the Bootstrap framework for quickly creating responsive and stylish interfaces. Utilizing Bootstrap allowed me to rapidly prototype and ensure compatibility with different devices.
To improve the organization and styling of CSS code, I began using the SCSS preprocessor. It provided me with the ability to use variables, mixins, and nesting, which greatly facilitated working with styles.
Recently, I have been deepening my knowledge in the field of Node.js, which enables the use of JavaScript on the server-side. This opens up new possibilities for developing full-fledged web applications that leverage server-side logic and interact with databases.
In the future, I aspire to continue my development as a Front-end developer, focusing on expanding my knowledge in JavaScript. I plan to explore new technologies and development approaches to become an expert in my field and create high-quality and innovative web applications."

Team Leader
Senior frontend/software developer
Just looking for a product company where my skills and views on how to make the product better will come in handy. Interested in long-term project work and development."
frontend,"I have extensive experience in frontend development and team leadership, having worked across various industries and technologies. Most recently, I served as a Frontend Team Lead, then was promoted to Engineering Manager at qrder.io, where I managed a cross-functional team of frontend, backend, and QA developers. I led the project refactoring process, significantly improving code quality and ensuring successful releases. Previously, I worked as a React Native Developer at omo.systems and MadFish Solutions, focusing on mobile applications and blockchain integrations. My roles involved making key architecture decisions, enhancing application performance, and optimizing development workflows using tools like React, Redux, and Storybook.
At previous workplaces, I have been involved in a wide range of projects: implementing websites on WordPress, developing applications for TV set-top boxes, supporting OTT delivery projects, and implementing features on three Angular projects (versions 1.6/1.7). I also upgraded one project to Angular 1.7, integrated parts of Angular-written code into other products, and even partially rewrote applications from Angular to React. In addition, I developed React Native applications from scratch, working with complex drag-and-drop animations using Reanimated. I became well-versed in Expo, starting and managing projects, including ejection, and later realizing the benefits of staying within Expo’s ecosystem.
Beyond my technical work, I’ve also taken on mentoring roles, leading the development team for a personal project where I built the backend on Express.js. I was also an instructor at Beetroot Academy, teaching Basic Frontend courses, where I successfully graduated students who now write React/Redux applications. Currently, I’m running my own React/Redux courses from scratch, continuing my passion for teaching and mentoring the next generation of developers.
Also, i was participating in conferences back in the days. Before all hype on AI technologies, i was talking about NLP and implementing it in facebook chatbot
Additionally, I am deeply familiar with the Reanimated framework, which I utilized for building highly interactive mobile applications. My commitment to both technical excellence and knowledge sharing has defined much of my career, and I remain dedicated to contributing to the developer community.
When it comes to my expectations, I’m looking for an environment that fosters professional growth, where I can continually learn, improve, and take on new challenges. I thrive in non-formal settings that encourage creativity, open communication, and collaboration. I value working with adequate management and clear processes, where decisions are made logically, and workflows are designed to support both team efficiency and individual contribution. It’s also important to me that I work on product-oriented projects, not in an outsourcing environment, where I can be fully immersed in the development, ownership, and evolution of a product from start to finish."
frontend,"I have 2+ years of experience as a Front-End Engineer, specializing in React, TypeScript, and WebSockets. My background in marine engineering (10 years) has developed my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, which I now apply to software development.

frontend,"- Worked closely with product managers and backend engineers to deliver features that meet customer expectations and business needs, while suggesting tools like React Scan to improve code quality and following trends to ensure the stack remains up to date.
- Led initiatives including the technical solution for Dark Mode, upgrading outdated core packages, and migrating multiple products from CRA to Vite for improved performance.
- Since ready-made solutions were not available for browser extension, I made my own to send logs to DataDog, which helped to detect and fix existing flaky cases, and prevent possible problems.
- Added running the linter and prettier before creating a commit/push, which helped to find errors earlier, without running on the pipeline, which saved time and money on the launch.
- Migrated and upgraded critical stack components, such as updating Cypress from version 8 to 14 and regularly upgrading Vite and other build tools across 4 projects.
- Reduced backend load by 2-5% by migrating validation logic from the backend to the frontend, cutting API call volume by over 98% (from 1.5-2 million to 10-17k requests per week).

In my current role, I am part of a small team of developers and my primary responsibilities include coding new features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with designers to ensure the successful delivery of projects. I am proactive in seeking feedback from my peers and seniors to improve my skills and ensure the quality of my work.
I am eager to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the React ecosystem. Currently, I am exploring ways to incorporate GraphQL into my projects and learning about new front-end technologies, such as Gatsby, that can help me deliver faster and more efficient web applications. I am also looking to improve my skills in testing and continuous integration to ensure the stability and reliability of my code.
As a React developer, I am proud to have worked on several interesting and challenging projects that have allowed me to demonstrate my skills and experience.
One of my most notable accomplishments was leading the development of a city traffic camera management system. I was responsible for building a web-based application that allowed city traffic operators to monitor and manage traffic cameras in real-time. The application was built using React and integrated with multiple API's to provide live video feeds and traffic data.
I also implemented a feature that allowed traffic operators to view and analyze traffic data, such as average speeds, traffic flow patterns, and congestion areas. This helped the city to make informed decisions about traffic management and improve overall traffic flow.
The project was well received by city officials and has since been implemented in several cities across the country, making it one of my proudest achievements as a React developer.
As a React developer, I am eager to learn and grow in my career. I have a strong foundation in React and am comfortable working with modern JavaScript frameworks.
I am looking for a role where I can apply my skills and knowledge to build high-quality, user-friendly applications. I am also eager to learn and expand my skill set by working with new technologies and techniques.
In terms of what I do not want to do, I prefer not to work on legacy systems or technologies that are no longer in widespread use. I also prefer not to work on projects that are not aligned with my values or ethics.
Overall, I am looking for a dynamic and challenging work environment where I can continue to grow as a React developer and make meaningful contributions to the development of cutting-edge applications."

In this project, I was Frontend developer responsible for implementing the user interface and integrating with the backend through REST API.
Stack: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JavaScript, and React, React Route.
- Developed and implemented responsive layouts, ensuring compatibility with various browsers and devices.
- Created structured and semantic HTML documents,
styled them with CSS, and implemented modern CSS technologies such as Flexbox and Grid.
-  Developed engaging animations and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.
- Collaboration with Designers: Worked closely with the design team to implement layouts and UI/UX elements accurately.
- Used JavaScript for interactive elements, such as sliders, modal windows, and dropdown menus.
During the work, I encountered an issue in the JavaScript code where the image slider was working inconsistently across different devices. Users reported freezing and incorrect image display.
Solution:
I identified that the main problems were caused by overly large images that took a long time to load and by the slider events being processed too frequently. For the web pages, I implemented modern image formats like WebP, which provide better compression while maintaining quality. I added the loading= ""lazy"" attribute to the image tags in HTML. This allowed the images that are not in the visible part of the screen to be loaded only when they become visible. I rewrote the event handlers for the slider using the debounce technique. This reduces the number of function calls during rapid, successive events (such as scrolling or resizing).
After implementing these changes, the slider worked stably on all devices and browsers. Additionally, thanks to the optimization of images and events, the page load time decreased, and overall performance improved.

In the courses, and in the future at work, I will be able to prove myself even better, as well as become an even stronger programmer, and this is my goal.
I have over then two years of self-study under my belt, during which I have become proficient in HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript (ES Next). I started with front-end web development, using the BEM methodology. I often worked with a mobile-last approach but am also capable of using a mobile-first approach. Additionally, I have mastered the Angular framework, completing several test tasks and even developing a small application with it. After that experience, I decided to venture into React. I have my own small marketplace (without transactions) built using the React, NodeJS, and MongoDB stack. These are the skills I have been honing over time. Currently, I am learning MobX to further expand my knowledge.

frontend,"For over three years, I have been creating commercial web applications utilizing modern technologies, gaining extensive proficiency in Vue, React, and JavaScript/TypeScript. My experience encompasses creating SPA/SSR applications, improving and refactoring existing applications, UI components library creation, integrating third-party solutions, and supporting legacy codebase.
Throughout my career, I have tackled projects across various domains and platforms, including cryptocurrency (using ethers.js and tronweb), Chrome extensions, and Telegram web applications. Additionally, I have expertise in Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, and Laravel.
My commonly used and familiar tools include Vue (versions 2 and 3), Nuxt, React (with hooks), Typescript, state management solutions like Vuex, Pinia, and Redux, SCSS, UI frameworks such as MUI, Antd, and Bootstrap, build tools like Vite or Webpack, Docker, Axios, i18n and other.
Friendly with Linux/macOS, confident in using the terminal.
I have created a browser-based crypto wallet as a library, which I have used later for the implementation of multi-signature.
Have refactored a huge UI Component library shared across different teams, which significantly improved app performance.
I am enthusiastic about collaborating on a product with individuals who are passionate about their craft and eager to share their expertise. I welcome the challenge of non-standard domains, as I am committed to ongoing personal and professional growth as a curious and inquisitive individual."

It’s important to me that the company supports professional growth, especially in areas like application architecture and enhancing Web3 solutions.
What I’d like to avoid is an environment without clear strategy and communication, where priorities often shift without clear reasons. I also value a team culture that takes a constructive approach to feedback and task discussions, as this helps everyone work more effectively and produce higher quality results.

I'm now working to hone my AI abilities, especially in the areas of deep learning model optimization and algorithm efficiency.  My goal is to become more proficient in large-scale software development and help create technological solutions that have an impact."
frontend,"In my work experience as a frontend developer, I have successfully delivered several impactful projects and worked with a variety of technologies.
Current Role
As a Senior React Developer at Zarttech, I focus on enhancing user experience and operational efficiency. I developed an automated tool that increased productivity by 50%, optimized website performance for better user interaction, and boosted security. I also lead a team of junior developers, where I mentor them, conduct code reviews, and introduce test-driven development (TDD) practices.
Technologies Used
In my current and past roles, I have used technologies like ""React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Redux, Jest, Cypress, and Next.js"". For backend work, I've leveraged ""Node.js, Express, and Git"". I’ve also worked with libraries like ""D3.js and Apexcharts"" to integrate advanced data visualizations.
Project Accomplishments
At Fullgap, I developed a centralized page for freelancers to manage their agreements, implemented robust data protection measures, and led a testing strategy that significantly reduced bugs. In my earlier role at Cyberroot International Limited, I revolutionized the display of cybersecurity data using real-time technologies like ""WebSocket"" and strengthened user authentication with ""OAuth 2.0, JWT, and MFA"".
What I Want to Improve
Moving forward, I want to deepen my expertise in ""performance optimization"" for large-scale applications and improve my understanding of ""React server components"".
This combination of leadership experience, technical expertise, and a focus on continuous improvement allows me to contribute significantly to my team's success.
In my career as a frontend developer, I’ve achieved several notable accomplishments across different projects and roles:
1. Boosted Operational Efficiency (Zarttech)
I developed an automated tool that increased both client and staff productivity by 50%. This tool streamlined internal operations, reducing the time needed for daily tasks, and played a pivotal role in improving company-wide workflows.
2. Improved Application Stability (Zarttech)
Through comprehensive testing, debugging, and troubleshooting, I resolved 98% of reported bugs, making the application more stable and reducing customer-reported issues. I also enhanced the CI/CD pipeline, integrating automated testing tools such as ""Jenkins"" and ""ESLint"", which cut production bugs by 20%.
3. Enhanced User Experience (Fullgap)
I implemented a centralized contract management page that allowed freelancers to access all agreements in one place. This greatly improved user accessibility and led to positive feedback regarding the streamlined interface.
4. Strengthened Data Security (Fullgap)
By spearheading a security upgrade across the platform, I ensured advanced data protection measures were in place, securing user data from potential threats. This proactive initiative earned client trust and reduced the vulnerability risk by a significant margin.
5. Data Visualization Innovation (Cyberroot International Limited)
I integrated advanced libraries such as ""D3.js"" and ""Apexcharts"" to create sophisticated data visualizations for complex cybersecurity data. This led to a marked improvement in client understanding of security threats, helping them make quicker and better-informed decisions.
6. Reduced Response Times (Cyberroot International Limited)
By collaborating closely with cybersecurity analysts and using ""WebSocket"" for real-time data transmission, I was able to decrease response times to security threats by 20%. This improvement streamlined incident management, making operations faster and more efficient.
7. Improved Application Performance (RapidMVP)
I helped optimize the performance of frontend features, reducing asset size by 10%, which improved the app’s performance, especially on low-bandwidth devices. This optimization enhanced user satisfaction and increased engagement.
Each of these accomplishments demonstrates my ability to solve technical problems, optimize user experiences, and significantly improve the overall functionality and security of applications​
In my work, I value the opportunity to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact, where I can leverage my skills in frontend development to solve real-world challenges. Specifically, I want:
What I Want:
- Continuous Learning & Growth: I thrive in environments that encourage learning new technologies and best practices. I aim to grow my expertise in areas like performance optimization, server-side rendering (SSR), and scalable system architectures.
- Challenging Projects: I’m motivated by projects that push me to think creatively and technically. Whether it’s building complex user interfaces, improving application performance, or implementing cutting-edge security features, I enjoy tasks that challenge my abilities.
- Collaboration & Mentorship: I enjoy working in teams where collaboration is encouraged, and knowledge-sharing is part of the culture. I also value opportunities to mentor and guide others, as I have done in past roles, helping junior developers grow their skills.
- Clear Communication & Feedback: Open, transparent communication with clear expectations is essential for me. I appreciate constructive feedback that helps me improve my work and align with team goals.
- Work-Life Balance: A healthy balance between work and personal life is crucial. I am more productive and creative when there is room for personal well-being alongside professional commitments.
What I Don’t Want:
- Micromanagement: I prefer autonomy in my work, where I can take ownership of tasks and find solutions independently. Being micromanaged stifles creativity and innovation.
- Stagnation: I don’t want to be in a position where there’s little room for growth or learning. Routine, repetitive work without new challenges would be unsatisfying.
- Toxic Work Environment: I avoid environments where communication is poor, and teamwork is hindered by negative attitudes or lack of respect. A positive, collaborative atmosphere is key to producing quality work.
By aligning my work with these expectations, I believe I can contribute effectively while continuing to grow and enjoy what I do."

frontend,"I've been developing, maintaining, and updating websites, and web apps for small businesses and startups in the EU/UK/US since 2016. It was mostly frontend work, although on some projects I was also working on backend tasks (PHP/Laravel). In addition to web development skills, I can develop mobile apps with React Native, and NativeScript-Vue for both Android/iOS.
Most of my projects were using Laravel + Vue. I also have React.js and Next.js experience. I have no problem working with vanilla JS, TypeScript, or even jQuery.

Currently, I'm looking for a Frontend developer, Mobile developer, or Fullstack developer role if the backend stack is close to Laravel/MySQL.
On one of the projects, I helped improve the first (at that time) version of the product. It was a mix of JS and jQuery with no architecture or style. It turned out, that I performed well enough to be hired a few years later to be responsible for the development of the V2 version of the product. I'm proud of the work I did for this version. Users were excited when they saw it, sign-ups and sales were growing exponentially

frontend,"Until 2018, I served as the sole frontend engineer at 8Guild studio, where our team focused primarily on developing HTML and WordPress templates for Envato ThemeForest, WrapBootstrap, and, eventually, the official Bootstrap market. My role extended beyond development to include client support and some contract work on UpWork.
My core responsibilities involved crafting high-quality HTML templates, leveraging Gulp for compiling SCSS, Pug (Jade), and JavaScript, along with tasks such as code concatenation and image optimization. I ensured all themes were cross-browser compatible, met the stringent standards of each marketplace, and were easily adaptable for WordPress implementation.
From 2018 to 2019, I transitioned to freelance work on UpWork and accepted a contracting role with Createx Studio. In early 2020, I accepted a frontend position with a non-IT company due to the significant downturn in freelance opportunities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This transition offered stability during a challenging period.
From 2023 to 2024, I worked as a contractor for ADITUS GmbH, a German-based company, where I was responsible for developing the frontend of an online platform for various ticketing systems. This role required expertise in both C# Razor and Vue frameworks, allowing me to integrate seamlessly with backend components while delivering a cohesive, responsive user experience.
Throughout my career, I have created numerous intricate and animated layouts. Every layout I design is built to adapt seamlessly across all screen sizes. I prioritize responsiveness by ensuring each section is fully optimized for all devices before progressing to the next.
Additionally, I focus on creating ""bulletproof"" elements—those that remain visually appealing and functional even if the content changes. Given that end users may have limited technical knowledge, I design with flexibility and robustness in mind, ensuring the layout remains intact and user-friendly regardless of modifications.
I expect to work on challenging and engaging projects that push my skills in frontend development, especially those involving intricate animations and highly responsive layouts. I enjoy crafting designs that are both visually appealing and structurally sound, ensuring they adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and remain functional even when content changes.
Code quality is something I take seriously, so I look for opportunities where clean, well-structured, and optimized code is a priority. I thrive in environments where best practices are valued and where there’s a strong focus on maintainability and scalability. I appreciate teams that understand the importance of writing solid, reusable code rather than quick fixes.
I also enjoy tackling creative and technical challenges, whether it’s refining UI/UX elements, optimizing performance, or integrating frontend components with backend systems. I like working on projects that require a balance of problem-solving and innovation, where I can bring both efficiency and attention to detail.
Since responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility have always been a key part of my work, I expect projects to ensure a seamless experience across all devices. A well-crafted layout should look and function just as well on a phone as it does on a desktop, and I appreciate working in environments that recognize the importance of that level of precision."
frontend,"I have recently completed courses in various technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript, React, Redux, Bootstrap, MUI, BEM, and Git. Although I haven't had professional work experience yet, I have gained a strong foundation in these technologies through the completion of these courses. During my training, I have worked on projects and tasks focused on building responsive web applications using HTML5, styling them with CSS3 and SASS, and enhancing interactivity using JavaScript and jQuery. Moreover, I've learned to manage state in applications using React and Redux, implement component libraries such as Bootstrap and MUI, and maintain version control using Git. I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting and further develop my abilities as a junior developer.
During my education, I was able to develop several websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing significant improvements in visual design and functionality. My ability to organize code structure using the BEM methodology and optimize websites for better user interaction was noted while learning Bootstrap and Material-UI. Additionally, my capacity to develop more complex functions and interact with servers via Axios has influenced the development of my skills. Utilizing React and Redux in building scalable applications has also broadened my horizons as a future developer.
What I want from the job of a React developer is the opportunity to enhance my skills in React, collaborate with experienced developers, and participate in projects where I can make a meaningful contribution. It's preferable to have mentors or a team that is willing to support my learning and growth. Additionally, it's essential for me to work in an environment that provides favorable learning support and the opportunity to actively learn and engage in the development processes.
What I don't want from a job is the lack of support and developmental opportunities, as well as projects that lack a clear focus on skill enhancement and the possibility to contribute."

frontend,"During my tenure at KazDevLab in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, I have gained extensive experience as a React Developer, initially starting as an intern in January 2022 and advancing to a Junior React Developer in June 2022. My primary responsibilities have included developing and enhancing frontend logic for various projects. For a taxi deport management system, I utilized React and Material UI to create efficient and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, I developed frontend logic using React and ChartJs for an information portal aimed at managers of a second-tier bank. One of my significant contributions was improving existing services for a governmental organization focused on statistical analysis, where I employed VueJs initially and later transitioned to using React, Typescript, ChartJs, and Arcgis map for advanced features. I also played a crucial role in enhancing the frontend logic and developing new features for a warehouses management system, using React and Typescript, and contributed to a photo editing platform for a marketplace by developing UI elements with React and Typescript.
Prior to my current role, I interned at QLT in October 2021, where I created layouts from Figma designs using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I also developed a photo gallery application using Vue.js, which fetched images from an external API. Additionally, I gained experience as an intern at Kolesa Upgrade, Kolesa Group from September to December 2021. There, I created the initial version of an online shop using HTML, SCSS, and the BEM methodology, and later developed a more advanced version using JavaScript and Vue.js with Vuex and Vue Router.
Throughout these roles, I have become proficient in various technologies, including frontend frameworks like React and Vue.js, state management with Vuex, and styling with Material UI, SCSS, and the BEM methodology. I have also worked with charting libraries such as ChartJs and mapping libraries like Arcgis map, and I am skilled in programming languages such as JavaScript and Typescript, alongside design tools like Figma.
Currently, as a Middle React Developer at KazDevLab, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop and enhance frontend logic for diverse applications, ensuring seamless user experiences through efficient UI components and improved features."

frontend,"Hello, I am a Junior Frontend Developer who recently completed my studies and is eager to start a career in development. I follow the BEM methodology for structuring styles and adhere to best coding practices. I am ready for new challenges, quick to learn, and eager to improve my skills by working on real projects.
During training in the Front-End Developer course, performed practical projects aimed at developing modern web applications. Implemented adaptive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux. Worked with the React framework to create interactive components and manage application state.
Here are some projects I would like to share:
My first pet project: It-Agency Adilat. It is a landing page created according to the layout in Figma, in which HTML, CSS, JS were used. With the help of Javascript, smooth transitions, filtering of works, as well as a gallery of reviews can be made.
The second project I wanted to present is the Image Gallery: for creating an image gallery using pure JavaScript, I used the following technologies and tools:
-HTML – to create the basic structure of the gallery, including the image container and control elements.
-CSS – to style the gallery, ensure responsive image display, and add effects.
-JavaScript – for dynamically loading images and handling events.
-Fetch API – to send HTTP requests to a server or an external API to retrieve a list of images.
The third e-book project: for creating a phone book, I used the following technologies and tools:
-React – for building components and managing the user interface.
-Redux – for managing the global state of the application, storing, and updating the contact list.
-React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector) – for managing local state and interacting with Redux.
-React Router – for implementing navigation between pages (e.g., contact list, add new contact page).
-Formik + Yup – for handling forms and validating user input.
-LocalStorage – for storing contacts.
During my studies and work on projects, I achieved the following results and acquired these skills:
-Developed several projects (both individual and team-based) using modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux.
-Mastered responsive and cross-browser layout, utilizing BEM methodology, Flexbox, and Grid.
-Learned to work with APIs using Fetch API and Axios, handle asynchronous requests, and use libraries for backend interaction.
-Gained experience with Git and GitHub, working in a team, using branches, pull requests, and code reviews.
-Used Vite for project optimization and bundling.
-Applied React and Redux Toolkit, working with hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, useSelector, useDispatch).
-Created forms with validation using Formik and Yup.
-Implemented SPA (Single Page Applications) using React Router.
-Worked in a SCRUM environment, applying Agile methodology and using a Task Manager (Trello).
This experience helped me gain confidence in my skills and prepared me for working on real-world projects.
I look forward to working on interesting and meaningful projects where I can apply my knowledge in interface design, improve the user experience and improve my skills in working with modern technologies. It is important for me to be able to work in a team of professionals, receive feedback, participate in code reviews and discuss technical solutions. I strive to have space for professional growth, learning new technologies and working on projects that have an impact on the end user. I also appreciate the atmosphere of interaction, support and clear organization of work processes."

As a junior frontend developer, I actively participated in various project tasks where teamwork was essential. I closely collaborated with colleagues, which not only helped to solve technical challenges efficiently but also allowed me to improve my communication and collaboration skills. I especially enjoyed learning new things — mastering new technologies, frameworks, and development methods. The courses from GoIT taught me a lot, helping me to deepen my knowledge and apply it in real-world projects. I constantly sought to improve my skills by learning from more experienced colleagues and implementing best practices in my work. Each project became an opportunity for me to contribute while growing professionally.

I implemented robust backend connections using Axios, which optimized resource usage and enhanced the application's overall performance.
One of the key aspects of this project was designing and developing a comprehensive admin panel for managing users and courses. This feature-rich panel enabled administrators to perform CRUD operations efficiently, allowing for the easy addition, editing, and deletion of data. To ensure efficient state management and handle side effects, I employed React hooks and a custom store using Zustand, which helped maintain session and user data consistently across the application.
I leveraged Material-UI components to build a modern and cohesive user interface, focusing heavily on user experience design. This included creating an intuitive interaction flow and providing real-time validation and feedback to ensure data accuracy. Performance optimization was a critical focus area; I minimized re-renders and implemented efficient data handling techniques to ensure the application ran smoothly.
Throughout the project, I maintained high standards of code quality and reliability by adhering to best practices for testing and code reviews. This proactive approach reduced potential downtime and improved the overall stability of the application. Collaboration was also key to the project's success; I worked closely with the backend developer to ensure seamless integration and timely resolution of any issues that arose.
This project not only showcased my ability to deliver a functional and aesthetically pleasing frontend but also highlighted my commitment to performance optimization and quality assurance.
I have also worked on study projects, where I was refining my skills and broaden my expertise during my studies. More information about these projects and my overall professional experience can be found in my CV.
Including links to all projects and their source codes.
Although I do not yet have a major achievement to highlight here, my first paid freelance project was a significant milestone. During this project, I successfully created an online test platform with a responsive design, providing a seamless experience for users across all devices. The platform's performance was significantly enhanced through optimized backend connections, which improved speed and efficiency. Additionally, I designed an intuitive admin panel, simplifying the management of users and courses. Close collaboration with backend developers ensured smooth integration and high-quality code throughout the project.
I aspire to work in an environment where mutual respect and collaboration are valued. It is my desire to be part of a team that supports and nurtures each other's growth and development. I believe in the power of mentorship and cooperation to enhance skills and expertise. On the flip side, I aim to avoid any work setting that promotes bullying or hinders personal and professional growth, as I believe that a positive work culture is essential for both personal satisfaction and career advancement."
frontend,"In projects I worked with the Vue.js framework, also Nuxt.js (SSR), and Vuetify.js, developing new features and fixing bugs.
I developed an online store with catalogs, filters, shopping carts, and comparable products for product cards. For the last year and a half I've been working on a Healthcare project with Backbone as well as Vue and more recently started migrating to React, so now I'm actively learning it too. It's quite a large and challenging project to understand with a lot of code. But during this time I got the knowledge to read and understand any code, even if it is not a native framework, not pure code) I also gained knowledge about unit tests, design patterns, OOD, requirements, etc.

frontend,"Українською:
Мій перший досвід роботи в ІТ був пов'язаний зі співпрацею з другом, який відкривав власний бізнес у США. Йому був потрібен веб-сайт для прийому заявок від клієнтів. Ми разом розробили макет, і я створив багатосторінковий сайт із системою авторизації для клієнтів та працівників. На той час веб-сайт успішно виконував усі поставлені завдання. Згодом, коли бізнес розширився, виникла потреба в масштабуванні сайту. Наразі той сайт вже не активний, оскільки більш кваліфіковані фахівці переробили його відповідно до зрослих потреб бізнесу.
Після цього проекту я отримав привабливу пропозицію роботи поза ІТ-сферою. Протягом останніх трьох років я пройшов шлях від кур'єра до помічника директора. Оскільки подальше кар'єрне зростання на цій позиції обмежене, я вирішив повернутися до ІТ-галузі, де можливості для професійного розвитку необмежені.
English:
My first IT work experience was collaborating with a friend who was starting his own business in the USA. He needed a website to receive client applications. Together, we designed the layout, and I created a multi-page website with login functionality for both clients and employees. At that time, the website successfully fulfilled all its intended purposes. Later, as the business expanded, there was a need to scale the website. Currently, that site is no longer active, as more qualified specialists redesigned it to meet the growing business requirements.
After this project, I received an attractive job offer outside the IT sector. Over the past three years, I have progressed from a courier to an executive assistant. Since further career growth in this position is limited, I have decided to return to the IT industry, where opportunities for professional development are unlimited.

frontend,"Я — начинающий frontend разработчик с глубоким интересом к созданию интерактивных и интуитивно понятных пользовательских интерфейсов. Мой стек технологий включает в себя HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Vue 3, и TypeScript. Я старательно работаю над совершенствованием своих навыков, стремясь к эффективному и чистому коду. Моя цель — создавать удивительные веб-приложения, которые улучшают пользовательский опыт и решают реальные проблемы.
Мое увлечение программированием началось с любопытства и желания создавать что-то новое. Первые шаги я делал, изучая основы HTML, CSS и JavaScript. Я был поражен возможностями, которые предоставляет фронтенд-разработка, и мне захотелось глубже погрузиться в этот мир.
Однажды, изучая различные инструменты и технологии, я наткнулся на фреймворк Vue.js. Его простота и эффективность сразу привлекли мое внимание. Я решил глубже изучить его, и для этого начал работать над различными проектами в домашних условиях.
Мой первый проект на Vue был простым списком задач. Я использовал Vue для создания интерфейса, добавления задач, их редактирования и удаления. Этот проект помог мне понять основные концепции Vue, такие как компоненты, реактивность и управление состоянием приложения.
Постепенно я расширял свои знания, изучая более сложные концепции и применяя их в новых проектах. Я создавал простые игры, интерактивные формы и даже небольшие веб-приложения. Каждый проект приносил мне новый опыт и уверенность в своих силах.
Хотя я только начинающий в этой области, я увлечен возможностями, которые открывает передо мной мир фронтенд-разработки. Мой опыт с Vue показал мне, насколько захватывающим и творческим может быть этот процесс, и я готов продолжать учиться и совершенствоваться, чтобы стать опытным специалистом в этой области.
Я хочу получить возможность развиваться в качестве фронтенд-разработчика и применять свои знания в реальных проектах. Я стремлюсь к работе в дружном коллективе, где смог бы обмениваться опытом с более опытными коллегами и учиться у них. Также важно для меня иметь возможность регулярно участвовать в обучающих мероприятиях или тренингах, чтобы держать себя в курсе последних технологических трендов.
Что касается того, чего я не хочу, то важно для меня избегать монотонной работы без возможности роста и развития. Я не хочу оставаться на месте, и мне важно, чтобы моя работа предоставляла мне возможность постоянно учиться и совершенствоваться. Также я бы хотел избегать ситуаций, когда отсутствует четкая коммуникация и поддержка со стороны руководства или коллег. Для меня важно чувствовать себя частью команды и иметь возможность обсуждать вопросы и решать проблемы вместе с коллегами."

frontend,"As for my experience
Have a look at the description of several of my projects.
I had enterprise projects and private as well.
As a result of this I've acquired a strong knowledge:
- work with map. I developed a feature to display processing (like vector or raster graphics) data from different satellites on the map with the help of Leaflet. User can outline any area with any shape on the map to process data.
- develop scalable and complex forms to share data. My work consisted of creating information and analytical center with a lot of roles and permissions in order to control data sharing. That data should display by way of graphs, tables (etc.) which have been presented as widgets. User can create own dashboards with widgets. Also I created a feature to move and resize widgets on the dashboards.
- strong documentation creation skills.  I've used Djeni and its packages to automate code-based documentation builds (like Angular Material Docs).
Currently I am working on the big platform to access to the world's learning resources. In addition to creating new functions, I had tech tasks like connecting monitoring tools or binding error tracking etc.
