business analyst,"Брав активну участь у розробці та прогнозуванні складних систем, забезпечуючи їх довгострокову масштабованість і адаптивність.
Застосовував аналітичні моделі для прогнозування поведінки системи за умов змінного навантаження та сценаріїв використання, що підтримувало стратегічне планування та прийняття рішень.
Поєднував технічну експертизу з бізнес-аналізом для створення гнучкої архітектури, узгодженої з цілями проєкту та вимогами ринку.
Заснував і масштабував платформу аналітики на базі ШІ (ELOGY) — від ідеї до робочого MVP з розпізнавання логотипів у реальному часі, аудіоаналізом та розрахунком медіа-цінності у стрімах та кіберспортивних трансляціях.
Успішно керував мультидисциплінарними командами (15+ спеціалістів) у сферах продакт-менеджменту, розробки, аналітики та маркетингу для складних цифрових продуктів.
Розробив унікальну модель розрахунку медіа-цінності для рекламодавців на Twitch та YouTube, що поєднує в собі видимість логотипів, кількість глядачів, згадки в аудіо та активність у чаті.
Запустив та підтримував B2B-інтеграції з Twitch API, OBS, Discord Bot та платформами аналітики, забезпечуючи повний цикл трекінгу рекламних кампаній та автоматизовану звітність.
Оптимізував внутрішні бізнес-процеси, впровадивши BPM-систему та електронний документообіг, що дозволило значно зменшити ручну працю та усунути вузькі місця в роботі.
Скоротив час аналітики рекламних кампаній більш ніж на 70%, впровадивши автоматичний збір даних та трекінг глядачів у реальному часі (Entyx).
Керував повним циклом створення високонавантажених продуктів зі стійкою інфраструктурою (Kubernetes, Redis, AWS, Firebase, Cloudflare).
Організував понад 30 кіберспортивних турнірів як регіональний представник Української Федерації Кіберспорту, створивши сильну спільноту та впізнаваність у регіоні.
Встановив стратегічні партнерства з агентствами, стримінговими платформами та рекламодавцями, що забезпечило перші пілоти та інтерес до ШІ-рішень у сфері реклами.
Зацікавлений у роботі над технологічними проектами, де можна застосовувати аналітичне мислення, досвід управління командами та глибоке розуміння архітектури складних систем.
Прагну долучатися до створення продуктів, побудованих на сучасних технологіях — машинному навчанні, комп’ютерному зорі, data-аналітиці, автоматизації процесів.
Особливу увагу приділяю участі у стартапах на ранніх стадіях: від формування ідеї та валідації гіпотез — до запуску MVP, розвитку платформи та залучення перших клієнтів.
Окремий інтерес — проєкти на перетині ІТ, ігрової індустрії та кіберспорту, де технології можуть покращити взаємодію з контентом, аналітику глядачів або автоматизувати рекламні інтеграції."

Куди хочу розвиватися:
Продуктовий дизайн: Хочу поглиблювати компетенції в продуктовому підході, працюючи над масштабними B2B та B2C-проєктами.
Дизайн-системи: Планую розвивати майстерність у створенні та підтримці дизайн-систем для різноманітних продуктів.
Адаптивні та інклюзивні інтерфейси: Маю ціль оволодіти найкращими практиками доступності (WCAG) та створювати продукти, зручні для всіх груп користувачів.
Експерименти та інновації: Цікавить R&D-підхід у дизайні – використання даних, проведення A/B-тестувань та інтеграція нових технологій.
Підхід та роль у команді
Координація роботи з розробниками: Формував чіткі UI-гайди та інтерактивні прототипи, забезпечуючи ефективну передачу дизайну в розробку.

Приклади досягнень

-30% часу на рутинні операції завдяки автоматизації документообігу та зручному інтерфейсу для співробітників (юристів, бухгалтерів, адміністрації).
Збільшення продуктивності кожного працівника на ~20% завдяки єдиній базі даних та чітким UX-патернам.

Покращення задоволеності клієнтів за рахунок швидшого формування замовлень і автоматизованих сповіщень.
Система аналітики цін та запасів Countifor (ОАЕ & Україна)

Зручний дашборд з візуалізацією ключових показників для маркетологів та менеджерів з продажу.
Збільшення ефективності планування: користувачі отримували чіткі рекомендації щодо обсягів закупівель і термінів постачання.
Очікування від роботи
Змістовні проєкти: Хочу працювати над продуктами, що мають реальну користь для людей, і впливати на формування їхнього досвіду (UX/UI).
Можливість експериментувати та вчитися: Важливо мати простір для тестування ідей (A/B-тести, дослідницькі спринти) та отримувати підтримку у пошуку нових підходів.
Командна взаємодія: Знаходжу натхнення у співпраці з іншими (розробниками, маркетологами, аналітиками). Хотів би мати спільні брейнстормінги, відкритий діалог та обмін ідеями.
Особиста та професійна свобода: Ціную можливість впливати на процеси, приймати рішення в межах своєї зони відповідальності та отримувати зворотний зв’язок від колег і керівництва.
Позитивне робоче середовище: Важливо, щоб у команді панувала довіра, взаємоповага та підтримка, де кожен може вільно висловлювати думки.
Чого б не хотів у роботі
Надмірна бюрократія і формалізм: Витрачання часу на необґрунтовані погодження чи жорсткі формальні процедури, що заважають швидко й ефективно діяти.
Рутина без викликів: Повторювані, одноманітні завдання, де немає простору для творчості та вдосконалення процесів.
Мікроменеджмент: Немає бажання працювати під постійним контролем; довіра до професіоналізму та самостійності – один із чинників продуктивності.
Відсутність зворотного зв’язку: Неможливість отримати оцінку результатів своєї роботи чи обговорити нові підходи та пропозиції."

Работал в рекламной компании, где отвечал за разработку и внедрение внутреннего ПО для автоматизации работы персонала.
– Выявлял бизнес-требования, формировал задачи для разработки;
– управлял жизненным циклом продукта;
– координировал коммуникацию между тех. отделом, бизнесом и персоналом;
– занимался оптимизацией бизнес-процессов.
Много выполняемых задач  требовали классических навыков бизнес-аналитика, но выполнялись интуитивно, методом проб и ошибок, что часто было далеко от идеала. Со временем пришел к выводу, что хочу углубиться в бизнес-анализ и заниматься этим специализированно.
Сейчас прохожу платное обучение, чтобы систематизировать опыт, закрыть пробелы и перейти в профессию формально.

business analyst,"Over the course of nine months working as a business analyst at a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), I gained valuable experience and deep knowledge in creating and implementing automated solutions. My role was pivotal at all stages of project development, from gathering requirements to their implementation.
One of my key responsibilities was interacting with clients: I analyzed their business processes, helped identify pain points, and formulated specific tasks for automation. Communicating with clients allowed me not only to better understand their needs but also to accurately translate their requests into technical specifications (TS) so that the development team could efficiently execute the project.
In addition to writing technical specifications, I was involved in project evaluation, which included analyzing the scope of work, resources, and timelines. My work required careful planning and the ability to anticipate potential challenges, contributing to the successful completion of the projects.
Each project presented a unique challenge, and the opportunity to apply my knowledge across various business sectors significantly broadened my horizons and improved my skills in working with both clients and colleagues.
One of the significant achievements in my work was the successful completion of approximately 10 projects, all based on my documentation and assessments. Each of these projects was delivered on time, fully meeting the forecasts and expectations of the clients. This demonstrates not only my ability to accurately formulate requirements and create clear technical specifications but also my precision in estimating timelines and resources.
I expect my work to bring both satisfaction and a sense of purpose. It should not only be a source of professional growth but also a way to create value — for myself and for others.

- Під час декретної відпустки розпочала розвиток у сфері Business Analysis: пройшла навчання з бізнес аналізу, працюю над pet-проєктом, здобуваю практичні навички збору та аналізу вимог.
- Володію англійською мовою на високому рівні (як усно, так і письмово). Рівень англійської - С1.
Очікую на можливість отримати практичний досвід у бізнес-аналізі, працювати з вимогами та користувацькими історіями, вдосконалювати навички роботи з інструментами BA.

I am proud of each project, each project version, each milestone, sprint and each successful client meeting. Of course, over the years, I have some cases that are the most different:
- government educational portal.
portal is a continuation of local schools, main functions - online report cards, login for students, teachers, parents, online textbooks, attendance too, also the possibility of group and individual chat between all participants of the platform.
Project was design from zero, was implemented day in and day out. It took six months and team of project manager+ business analyst, full stack php developer, 3 qa specialists. My role on this project was business analyst, product owner and project manager.
- Fintech online payment project. After doing a business analysis of requirements, I was offered a new model of platform work, changing the technology stack, improving system security and reliability, reducing transaction fees, changing the sign-up approach, which allowed for greater user conversion.
- online streaming platform. I discovered client needs and prototypes and proposed nexts points: I found empty parts of project (API payment system),
offered to separate admin part from mobile to web version, design project estimate and evaluation, and offered to optimize critical path by developing project by version, team of 2 developers, and parallel tasks. These proposals halved the development period and reduced the risks
I expected for:
- remote job (part-time or flexible schedule)
- truly friendly and close-knit team of professionals, who are constantly engaged in self-development, never give up and understand there is no comfortable project.
- interesting projects of FinTech (I am glad of each project as new opportunity).
- I am always learning so it will be pleasure if my new job gives me new challenges"

Meaningful projects → I want to work on products that solve real business problems, not just document changes.
A team of professionals → I value interaction with strong specialists from whom I can learn and grow.
Using analytics and AI → I want to work with data analysis tools, AI solutions, and automation.
Space for development → it is important to have the opportunity to develop, implement new approaches, and optimize processes.
What I don’t want:
“Secretary” work → if business analysis is limited to documenting what the customer said, it’s not interesting.
Chaos → lack of processes when requirements change chaotically, and the team doesn’t know what to do next.
Old approaches without changes → if the company is not ready for improvements and automation, this is not my environment."

business analyst,"As a Business Analyst, I have worked on several projects over the last four years. A few of the projects I worked on were warehouse accounting automation, integration with LMS for an Education project, introducing an app engagement program and technical support automation program for telecom, and implementation of a FinTech startup. My role in these projects was to work with business stakeholders and development teams to understand business processes and user needs, form the concept of projects, write business requirements, use cases, and user stories, as well as participate in presenting projects to committees and controlling their implementation.
My extensive knowledge of digital marketing has been valuable in deploying projects focused on lead generation. I have experience working with various domains such as EdTech, FinTech, and telecom, as well as projects related to the fields of medicine, education, and relocation.
In a telecommunications company, I was responsible for implementing projects for developing an automated platform, coordinating technical implementation from the IT side, gathering and documenting business requirements, use cases, technical tasks, and developing Business Cases, as well as defending projects on internal committees.
I had the opportunity to work on developing the FinTech product, which is designed to automate accounting for Sole proprietors. My role was to describe business requirements, user stories and use cases to develop the project.
In one project, I was responsible for managing the development of a web application for a skincare company. My role was to ensure the project stayed within scope and budget, communicate with stakeholders, and work with the development team to develop the project and troubleshoot issues.
I worked on a project to improve a company's supply chain processes. My role was to gather and analyze data, identify areas for improvement, and develop and implement solutions. I used tools such as Excel, SQL, PowerBI & Tableau for data analysis and visualization. In another project, I worked on developing a predictive analytics model to forecast sales for a retail client.
Moving forward, I am interested in developing my skills, as well as further developing my technical skills in business analysis and product development. I believe these skills will be increasingly valuable in today's digital landscape and will enable me to make more informed decisions as a business analyst.
Telecom project
My responsibilities as the business analyst included conducting a detailed analysis of trends and patterns of customer behavior, preparation of Business Requirements, development of financial and economic justification of projects, protection of projects at internal committees of the Company, development of Time-Plan projects, and preparation of technical tasks. I also collaborated with Digital, PR, and Marcom to develop a promotion plan and develop a strategy to develop customer engagement with the telecom operator.
FinTech project
My responsibilities as a Lead Business Analyst included the collection, documentation, and analysis of business requirements, including creating technical documentation, defining acceptance criteria, use cases, and user stories, as well as managing the lifecycle of requirements. I worked on API integrations with payment providers, including Apple Pay and Google Pay, and contributed to the unification of functional modules for SaaS platform development.
Additionally, I delivered the development of Virtual and Physical Card functionality in collaboration with Visa and designed analytics modules integrated with databases and AWS services.
FinTech project
As an invited business analyst, I had partial experience in the development of the FinTech product - a platform that automates accounting for Sole proprietors. The main goal of the project was to simplify accounting processes for entrepreneurs of the second group and reduce the likelihood of errors in their tax reporting. My role in the project was to describe business requirements, user stories and use cases to develop the project as well as to work with the development team to ensure that the necessary features were implemented in the application. I also gathered feedback from practitioners to ensure that the application was user-friendly and effective.
EdTech project
This EdTech educational project was created to provide high-quality IT education for military and displaced persons affected by the consequences of war and other people, who want to grow in the IT industry. My role in this project was to oversee the development of the website and to lead the team in building a robust LMS system for the training program.

business analyst,"An entry-level business analyst with over six years of experience in data research, where the key focus was identifying needs and analyzing potential customers of clients across various industries. Successfully managed teams ranging from three to twenty data researchers, ensuring compliance with search criteria, quality standards, and deadlines. Maintained effective communication between the team, the sales department, and clients.
Recently completed a business analysis course, gaining knowledge of SDLC resume_classifier with a strong focus on the SCRUM framework, as well as skills in business requirements development, process modeling, and optimization using UML and BPMN.
Possess basic SQL knowledge for data analysis. Confident in working with spreadsheets and G-Suite. Strong critical thinking and communication skills.
A large client company was considering renewing their subscription to the service of the company I worked for, and the entire team understood that action needed to be taken to encourage them to do so. A month before their current contract ended, it was decided to involve more sales specialists who would handle a higher volume of emails and make more cold calls to potential buyers of the client’s product.
My task was to identify the industry in which the potential buyer companies were most likely to schedule the most appointments. The challenge was that, by this point in the project, we had already exhausted the most obvious industries for prospecting. Additionally, I needed to triple the volume of delivered work to meet the increased sales team’s need for new contacts.
After analyzing the market, I identified and aligned with the client on the industries that would bring us the best results. During the first two weeks, we focused on two new industries. Then, based on the most successful experience, we narrowed it down to one.
Through effective planning, which I completed in advance before the client’s contract expired, I prioritized my other ongoing projects and focused solely on this initiative three weeks before its potential completion. As a result, our team secured 17 appointments in less than a month, leading to the client renewing their subscription for another 12 months.
Another achievement I am proud of is solving an issue where data researchers on my team spent excessive time manually checking duplicates against exclusion lists or the existing database. This not only affected the overall time required to meet the weekly contact quota but also reduced the number of contacts, as some companies or leads could be overlooked. This resulted in them having to be excluded at the quality control stage.
My task was to help optimize this process. By implementing formulas for comparing data across related tables, I automated this routine task, reducing errors and improving the researchers’ efficiency in completing their weekly sprints.
I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience as a business analyst and contribute to successfully implementing IT projects."

business analyst,"I started my career in IT, performing various tasks primarily within the sales and business analysis spectrum.
As a Business Analyst, I was bridging the gap between clients and developers, keeping everyone aligned throughout the project. I gathered and refined clients' requirements, mapped out processes using BPMN, and created user story maps to visualize the customer journey. I'm skilled at analyzing data and visualizing solutions to find the best approaches. I'm comfortable with a range of tools that have helped me a lot in my work - from data visualization software like Power BI, Tableau,
and Looker to project management tools like Trello and Jira, to everyday workhorses like Excel and Google Sheets.
As the Sales Manager, I led a revamp of sales operations: crafting specific KPIs, reshaping lead acquisition, and adjusting the sales funnel and sales process to make them more agile and responsive to market trends. Subsequently, my involvement in pre-sales and sales, in addition to account management and customer success, allowed me to enhance the reliability and predictability of the sales process.
My additional besides-the-IT experience includes key roles in SGS - a big Name in the Testing, Inspection & Certification industry. Not only was I dealing with top-tier clients and overseeing essential projects, but I was also busy selling complex B2B services. Along the way, my communication skills got a serious workout, as I was chatting with technical and non-technical colleagues alike. This journey gave me a bit of everything—contract navigation with lots of stakeholders on board, negotiation, problem-solving, and handling of budgets. Leading teams of over 130 members further highlights my people management skills.
Within the IT domain, the changes I implemented as a Sales Manager and Business Analyst paved the way for steady growth and a twofold increase in monthly customer acquisition within a year.

In my previous roles, my Salary depended directly on my performance, as it included a fixed base and a percentage of sales or the profit margin I brought to the company. That’s why I always made it a priority to dive into work from day one and deliver results early on bringing value both to myself and the company.
I consider this one of my key achievements: my ability to learn quickly, adapt fast, and become a valuable contributor in a short time. I clearly remember how my managers praised me, saying no one had ever delivered results as effectively during the first months as I did. It was incredibly rewarding to receive such recognition for my work.

business analyst,"Разработал 30+ проектов, запускал множество проектов и управлял командами. Моей основной задачей является работа с клиентом, анализ существующих процессов и конечное предложение автоматизации данных процессов. Помимо этого в опыте я реализовывал новое видение в части развития продукта. Ко мне приходят с идеей либо же с уже существующим продуктом, с целью увеличения доходности, создания эффективной модели работы с клиентом и командой, указания будущих вариантов развития продукта или же консультационные работы.
Из ярких проектов в которых мне приходилось участвовать могу отметить такие как:
* Работал над проектом по автоматизации процессов агропромышленного комплекса более 3 лет. Этот проект стал для меня профессиональным вызовом, требующим погружения в новую предметную область. Мне пришлось изучить множество терминов, разобраться в специфике агроиндустрии и найти решения, которые эффективно работают даже в сложных условиях.
Проект с бюджетом 1,5 млрд тенге стал уникальным благодаря нашей команде из 30 специалистов (аналитики, разработчики, тестировщики, дизайнеры и проектные менеджеры). Мы создали систему, которая охватывает все аспекты управления и учета агробизнеса.
* Создание и аналитики модуля автокредитования, потребительских кредитов, товарных кредитов в банках страны. Как результат данной работы анализирую факты могу указать что система была принята с положительными отзывами со стороны пользователей данного сервиса.
* Система аналитики и мгновенного маркетинга(realtime marketing) в условиях дорожного потока. Данный продукт имел технические сложности в реализации учитывая факторы погодного условия, скорости потока, распознавание атрибутов технических средств и дальнейшая обработка данных с целью показа эффективной рекламы на медиабордах. Мне пришлось собирать команду, искать готовые сервисы которые могут решить вопросы, предложить наилучшие решения в части финансов и точности. Как результат по окончанию презентации вопросы со стороны команд были исчерпаны, процесс разработки был адаптирован и не требовал других вмешательств в части анализа.
Успешные внедрения, счастливые клиенты, уменьшение стресса в процессах.

business analyst,"Під час моєї практики в компанії Mint Company я мала можливість активно займатися розробкою проектів, пов'язаних зі створенням user stories, визначенням acceptance criteria та розробкою activity diagrams. Моя роль у команді включала регулярне спілкування з клієнтами для збору вимог, формулювання цих вимог у вигляді user stories та уточнення acceptance criteria для забезпечення точності та повноти функціональних вимог.
Технології, які я використовувала, включали draw.io та Miro для візуалізації процесів та створення діаграм. Ці інструменти дозволяли ефективно моделювати взаємодії між користувачами та системою, а також визначати послідовність дій у рамках проекту.

Також мене цікавить глибше вивчення інструментів для автоматизації тестування та покращення процесів управління проектами для досягнення кращої ефективності та якості розроблених продуктів.
Мої зусилля спрямовувались на впровадження кращих практик у формулюванні вимог, що дозволило поліпшити зв'язок з клієнтами та зменшити час, витрачений на уточнення вимог.
Поміж досягнень також можна відзначити успішну імплементацію activity diagrams у процесі розробки, що підвищило зрозуміння завдань в команді та поліпшило спілкування між учасниками проекту."

спрощення/прискорення обробки
* Набір скриптів для попереднього очищення та редагування даних за напрацьованими
алгоритмами Вищеописані впровадження збільшили швидкість завантаження товарів одним
модератором з 10-20к/міс до 300-400к/міс що стало ключовим у розвитку Маркетплейса на
певному етапі. Також дало нові можливості обробки даних.

Маркетплейсі в цілому. Працює за принципом вивантаження даних у CSV файли, де вони поетапно
обробляються модератором. Так само застосовуються скрипти автоматичного очищення та
редагування. Функціонал складається з 6 етапів, кожен етап - це налаштування певного об'єкта
даних товару. Найбільш складним виявилося налаштування характеристик.
Використання цього функціоналу дало можливість налаштовувати 40-50к товарів на міс. одним
модератором, порівняно з поштучним налаштуванням 400-500 тов/міс різниця суттєва.
* налагоджено облік роботи модераторів, за рахунок обробки та візуалізації даних можна швидко

""I'm a Business Analyst with hands-on experience in business and system analysis. I've worked on researching marketplaces and building CRM and ERP tools. These tools help businesses better connect with their customers and make decisions using real data.
I've helped roll out features for their Finance, Marketing, and Logistics teams. It's been both challenging and rewarding. My job is to understand what's needed, break down tasks, keep track of our progress, and show our results to the people we work for. I oversee how we build and improve parts of the system.
I've also worked in real estate, helping to upgrade a CRM system. We did a bunch of projects, from generating new business leads, setting up a call center, to working with banks. We even made a system that can see if a customer is upset just from their face and connect them to our top salespeople.
I believe a good analyst should know about different tools and methods. Sometimes, it's even about making a new tool that's just right for the team. The goal is always to see the bigger picture and add real value."""

business analyst,"Hi there, dear recruiters!
I’m looking for a goal-oriented company - one that wants to grow, improve, and become stronger. Whether your team already has clear goals or is just starting to track them, I’d love to be part of that journey and help make it happen.
Here’s a quick look at my most relevant experience:
I’ve been working in B2B sales and business development for almost 7 years, mostly with tech companies. I’ve helped teams grow revenue, build strong relationships with clients, and improve how sales processes work. I’ve also built a sales department from scratch, so I know how to set up systems and scale them.
My main focus has been in outsourcing and outstaffing. I’ve done the full sales cycle: from lead generation and negotiations to closing deals and growing key accounts. I’ve signed high-value contracts through personalized outreach and by truly understanding what the client needs. I also created an account management system that helped keep clients happy and made internal work smoother.
I’ve worked closely with presale teams, helping shape offers and write proposals that win. Overall, I’ve got experience across the whole business development process - from the first contact to long-term cooperation.
My style is turning insights into clear actions that support growth and long-term success. That's why I'm proficient in data and business analysis.
Lately, I’ve also been involved in marketing, which gave me a fresh look at how sales and marketing can work better together.
On top of all that, I’m someone who really understands people. I’m empathic, and that helps me connect with clients and lead teams in a way that feels supportive and effective.
Everything I’ve learned so far helps me see the bigger picture and focus on what actually drives results.
So, if you’re still reading this, I hope we’re on the same page, and I’d be excited to connect!
- Increased annual revenue by 38% by improving sales strategy and focusing on high-potential clients.
- Reduced cost per lead by 75% through smarter lead generation and better qualification processes.
- Built a sales department from scratch, including hiring, training, and setting up workflows and KPIs.
- Closed multiple high-value B2B deals through personalized outreach and deep understanding of client needs.
- Developed an account management system that improved client retention and made internal communication more efficient.
- Grew average contract value by 15% through upselling and long-term client relationship building.
- Led a sales team that consistently met and exceeded monthly and quarterly targets.
- Worked closely with presale and marketing teams, helping create proposals and aligning sales with marketing strategies.
- Used data tools to track performance, analyze trends, and make better business decisions.
- I want to join a company that has clear goals and wants to grow.
- I’m looking for a company that’s transparent, honest, and works together to get things done.
- I want to use my experience in sales and business development to bring real results.
- I’d love to help set up or improve sales processes and make things work better and faster.
- I enjoy working in a place where ideas are welcome, and where people care about improving.

business analyst,"For over 13 years, I have been working in a variety of roles, primarily focused on project management, business analysis, and software testing, with extensive experience in developing CRM systems. My career has involved leading projects from inception to completion, ensuring that each phase—from requirements discussion to production installation—is executed efficiently. I have created comprehensive documentation throughout this process, including specifications, presentations, admin guides, user guides, test cases, and delivery plans.
In addition to my experience with CRM systems, I have successfully implemented projects in other domains, such as Human Resources and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. My work with banks has provided me with a strong understanding of their specific requirements.
I take pride in managing the testing and development processes/environments while also overseeing customer environments. My technical skills include building new versions in Jenkins, creating Docker containers, and deploying applications to servers, ensuring smooth and efficient software delivery.
I work closely with customers, supporting them by conducting thorough analyses of their problems and needs. This includes identifying the root causes of issues—whether they stem from bugs or highlight missing functionalities—and proposing appropriate solutions. I have also been involved in API testing using Postman, which has given me a basic understanding of integration layers, further enhancing my ability to bridge communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Moreover, I manage the reporting aspect of the applications we develop. This involves analyzing data, transforming it for reporting purposes, and creating detailed reports and charts that provide valuable insights for stakeholders.
While I aim to grow primarily as a Business Analyst, I am also enthusiastic about contributing to the full project lifecycle, from gathering requirements to delivering high-quality solutions to customers.
1. In a significant project, the requirements discussion phase alone spanned approximately 1.5 months. This project faced challenging implementation phases that required fine-tuning throughout its duration. Ultimately, the delivery resulted in a remarkable increase in efficiency for the customer—up to 30%. I played a crucial role in the requirements gathering, project management, and testing teams, gaining extensive experience as a Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Tester.
2. In another project for a client, we focused on merging several companies acquired by the customer. The goal was to ensure a smooth and seamless transition to a new CRM system, including integrating with their existing core systems. My responsibilities included participating in the requirements gathering, project management, and testing phases, further enhancing my experience as a Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Tester.
3. I was involved in a performance optimization project for one of our clients, where we aimed to achieve a specific speed for message processing. In this role, I served as a key member of the testing team and acted as the main liaison between the customer and the developers.

With 10+ years of experience in banking, tech, and government, I’ve helped teams move from scattered information and unclear responsibilities to well-defined data, smarter workflows, and systems people can trust and use.
What I’ve done:
Led implementation of data governance frameworks from the ground up — glossary, data ownership, data quality checks, and training included.
Drove master data efforts, helping organizations define critical data (like contracts, locations, customers), set standards, and clean it up at scale.
Improved and automated contract management across 15+ countries, cutting manual work and delays.
Worked with product and business teams to replace Excel chaos with clear dashboards and self-service reporting.
Played a key role in later stages of Discovery — helping connect the dots, close gaps, and get projects ready for delivery.
I’m practical, structured, and focused on what brings value — not just in documentation, but in how people work with data every day. I ask clear questions, listen well, and make sure what we build solves the real problem.
Open to roles in:
Data governance and management
Business analysis
Process and workflow improvement
Project delivery in data-related domains

Монлтонна технічна підтримка – не хочу займатися виключно виправленням дрібних багів або обслуговуванням legacy-систем без можливості вдосконалювати процеси.
Жорстка бюрократія – якщо процеси в компанії настільки закостенілі, що на кожну зміну потрібні 10 схвалень, це не для мене.

business analyst,"Про мене
Я — досвідчений керівник змін, відповідальний за організацію роботи команди та досягнення високих результатів.
Моя мета — розвиватися у сфері бізнес-аналізу, де я зможу застосувати свій досвід у пошуку рішень, оптимізації процесів та створенні ефективних бізнес-рішень. Я прагну вдосконалити навички аналізу даних, щоб розробляти та впроваджувати IT-рішення, які відповідатимуть потребам сучасних компаній. Активно використовую сучасні інструменти для управління проектами та аналізу: Jira, Balsamiq, Miro, Draw.io, Google Sheets, Figma, Microsoft Office, ChatGPT.
Мене мотивує можливість розвитку, вирішення нових викликів та внесення реального внеску у вдосконалення бізнес-процесів. Я вірю, що аналіз і вдосконалення механізмів роботи — це ключ до успіху будь-якої організації.
Я активно працюю над розвитком своїх навичок та знань у бізнес-аналізі, щоб стати кваліфікованим фахівцем у цій галузі. Нещодавно я успішно завершила курс з бізнес-аналізу, де опанувала ключові методики та інструменти, такі як створення вимог, моделювання бізнес-процесів, робота з зацікавленими сторонами та аналіз даних.
Набуті знання я одразу застосовую на практиці, працюючи над pet project, що дозволяє мені поглиблювати розуміння процесів і відточувати навички у реальних умовах. У цьому проєкті я розробляю бізнес-вимоги, створюю діаграми процесів за допомогою Miro та Draw.io, використовую Figma для прототипування та Jira для управління завданнями.
Окрім цього, я постійно вдосконалюю свої софт-скіли, зокрема комунікацію, тайм-менеджмент і командну співпрацю, щоб бути готовою ефективно взаємодіяти з різними зацікавленими сторонами. Я також слідкую за останніми тенденціями у сфері бізнес-аналізу та активно шукаю можливості для реалізації нових знань на практиці.
Оптимізація трудозатрат у зміні
У своїй роботі я впровадила оптимізацію трудозатрат, що дозволило підвищити ефективність роботи зміни, зменшити простої та покращити розподіл ресурсів.
Основні кроки оптимізації:
1. Розвиток універсальних працівників
Запровадила навчання та ротацію персоналу, щоб збільшити кількість універсальних робітників.
Це дозволило швидко змінювати позиціонування залежно від поточного навантаження та мінімізувати вузькі місця в процесах.
2. Оптимізація позиціонування на зміні
Гнучке перерозподілення працівників відповідно до поточної ситуації та завантаженості зон.
Зменшення простоїв та підвищення продуктивності за рахунок динамічного управління ресурсами.
3. Контроль і регулювання простоїв
Впровадила механізм оперативного моніторингу простоїв та коригування плану змін відповідно до реального попиту.
Скоротила втрати часу завдяки швидкому реагуванню на зниження навантаження в різних зонах.
4. Додавання персоналу в години пікового потенціалу
Аналіз попередніх змін дозволив спрогнозувати години максимального навантаження.
Оптимізувала графік виходу працівників, забезпечивши достатню кількість персоналу в критичні періоди.
Результати:
Зменшення простоїв і більш рівномірний розподіл робочого навантаження.
Підвищення продуктивності та швидкості обслуговування клієнтів.
Гнучкість у реагуванні на зміну завантаженості зміни.
Покращення мотивації працівників завдяки їх універсальності та оптимальному розподілу обов’язків.
Ці зміни зробили робочий процес більш ефективним, дозволили максимально використовувати потенціал команди та покращили загальну організацію змін."

As part of my accounting responsibilities, I prepared statistical and tax reports, requiring a deep understanding of financial data analysis and compliance with tax regulations. I have effectively corresponded with tax authorities, ensuring timely and accurate submission of required documentation and addressing any queries or issues that arose. Through these interactions, I developed a strong understanding of tax reporting and compliance requirements.
In my role as an accountant, I worked extensively with accounting software such as 1C 8.2 and Unity Logo programs. I am proficient in data processing and analysis using these tools, allowing me to extract valuable insights from financial data. Moreover, I am familiar with e-government portals such as e-taxes.gov.az and e-gov.az, having utilized them for banking and tax-related tasks.
I also have experience in conducting cash transactions, preparing bank payment orders and transfers, and processing Salary payments. This experience has enhanced my financial acumen and my ability to manage financial transactions accurately and efficiently.
Investigation of applications in the project regarding the provision of state guarantees and subsidy of credit interest for entrepreneurship entities operating in sectors affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;
Identifying and addressing violations in the ""ƏDV geri al"" project: informal sales without invoices, deletion of merchandise records, inaccuracies in cash register systems, income concealment, and non-compliance with tax legislation in the purchase of goods for entrepreneurial purposes;
Implementation of relevant activities related to the 'Voluntary Tax Disclosure' project.
I am writing to express my strong interest in transitioning my career to Business Analysis, Project Management, or Product Management. With 8 years of tax and 2 years of accounting experience, I have a solid foundation in financial analysis and problem-solving. My desire for personal growth and taking a proactive role in driving business growth has led me to explore new opportunities.
I am motivated by the intrinsic satisfaction of embracing new challenges and learning opportunities. I believe these roles will leverage my existing expertise while allowing me to develop a diverse range of skills. I am fully prepared to invest the necessary time and effort to acquire the relevant skills and adapt to new environments.
Building upon my financial expertise, I will apply my analytical skills and attention to detail to complex challenges in these roles. I look forward to contributing to informed decision-making, efficient resource allocation, and identifying growth opportunities.
I thrive in collaborative environments and have a proven ability to work effectively with diverse stakeholders. I am eager to engage in cross-functional collaboration, develop strong relationships, and achieve shared objectives through open communication and leadership.
Career growth and advancement are important to me, and I am committed to continuous professional development.

Хоча в цьому направленні я новачок, я бачу себе в Business Analysis, оскільки маю аналітичний склад розуму і критичне мислення, люблю в усьому логіку, бачу сенс в деталях і розумію важливість фіксування і документування робочого процесу. В міжособистісному спілкування проявляю емпатію і вміння розуміти потреби інших.
В грудні 2023 р. отримала сертифікат за проходження курсу ""Професія Бізнес-аналітик в IT 3.0"" від Genius. Курси допомогли мені систематизувати знання про бізнес-аналіз, навчитись розрізняти типи вимог і працювати з ними, моделювати бізнес-процеси (Draw.io), використовувати інструменти бізнес-аналізу (Jira, Confluence), навчитись докуменуванню системних вимог (Use Case, User Story).

This is a lifestyle that provides an opportunity to develop, solve interesting and non-trivial tasks, achieve goals, implement ambitious projects, build optimal processes together with a team that also enjoys work and treats it more like a hobby.
When working with a team, I consider it important to make a collective decision, which every member of the team is ready to sign, but in critical situations I leave the final decision to myself.  I take on a project if I am confident in my abilities and find an approach to each team member in order to motivate them and involve them in the project. I am constantly engaged in self-development and improvement of my skills and knowledge.

Proficient in data analysis, market research, and process improvement, I bring a deep understanding of both business needs and IT requirements, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders.
With expertise in a range of analytical and technical tools, including SQL, Python, Excel, Google Analytics, Tableau, and Power BI, I am adept at extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data to identify trends, uncover insights, and inform strategic decisions. My technical skill set extends to database management and querying, enabling efficient data manipulation and integration across systems to create robust reporting solutions. I also have experience working with content management systems (CMS) and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, such as Salesforce and HubSpot, which enhance my ability to optimize customer journeys and personalize user experiences.
In addition to my data analysis skills, I am well-versed in Agile and Scrum methodologies, ensuring effective project management and collaborative product development. I regularly use tools such as JIRA, Confluence, and Asana to facilitate clear communication with development teams, prioritize tasks, and maintain alignment with project objectives. My understanding of software development life cycles (SDLC) and familiarity with API integrations enables me to work closely with developers, ensuring that business requirements are effectively translated into technical specifications.
As a tech-savvy analyst, I am always exploring emerging technologies and best practices to continuously improve operational efficiency and adapt to evolving business needs. My technical skills are complemented by a strong foundation in UX/UI principles, allowing me to make data-driven recommendations that enhance usability and optimize the end-user experience on digital platforms.
Through my analytical capabilities and technical acumen, I have successfully implemented automation solutions that reduce manual workload, developed dashboards for real-time performance tracking, and optimized website features that drive user engag
I have experience working as a Business Analyst for a logistics startup, where I gained hands-on expertise in optimizing operations and streamlining processes.

What I Want from Work: I am seeking a role that allows me to leverage both my analytical and technical skills in a dynamic, forward-thinking environment where I can make a meaningful impact. I value a collaborative culture where cross-functional teamwork and open communication are encouraged, allowing me to work closely with technical teams, business stakeholders, and leadership. I enjoy positions that offer opportunities for continuous learning and professional development, especially in areas like data analytics, new technologies, and advanced business intelligence tools. Ideally, I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to solving complex business problems, drive strategic decisions, and help improve customer experiences through data-driven insights.

A clear career development path, with room for advancement, is also something I prioritize in a role.
What I Don’t Want from Work: I aim to avoid environments that are highly bureaucratic or resistant to change, where there’s little room for innovation or process improvement. I’m not interested in roles that lack clarity around responsibilities or long-term goals, as well as those with limited support for professional growth and learning. A role with excessive micromanagement or rigid structures that limit flexibility would not align with my ideal work environment. Additionally, I’d prefer to avoid positions where the focus is solely on routine, repetitive tasks without opportunities to take on new challenges or leverage data for meaningful insights.
Ultimately, I seek a balanced role where my contributions are valued, my skills are utilized, and I have the freedom to grow both professionally and personally."

У рамках цих проектів я здійснював аналіз потреб клієнтів, розробляв UML та не UML-діаграми для відображення сценаріїв використання та створював інтерактивні прототипи в Balsamiq. Дослідження пинципів взаємодії з іншими системами за допомогою API. Також створював та впроваджував для команди розробників User Stories і Use Cases, що дозволяло підвищити ефективність проекту та поліпшити взаємодію між членами команди.
За тривалий час на керівні посаді здобув навички планування та пріоритезації задач, а також прийняття рішень. Серед моїх сильних сторін - комунікативні навички та вміння працювати в команді. Володію добре розвиненими навичками системного та аналітичного мислення. Нещодавно пройшовши курс бізнес-аналізу, я отримав навички з управління вимогами, створення прототипів та методів моделювання бізнес-процесів.
Як високомотивований бізнес-аналітик початкового рівня, завдяки своїй освіті та професійному досвіду я створив міцну основу для бізнес-аналізу. Я очікую отримати оффер від компанії, орієнтованій на командну роботу у дружній атмосфері та середовищі, яке сприяє професійному становленню та подальшому зростанню."

With over a decade of experience at the intersection of business, product, and technology, I bring a unique blend of entrepreneurial drive, strategic insight, and hands-on business analysis expertise.
My career launched in 2014 as the Founder and CEO of uCat, a B2B SaaS platform for retail and logistics. I built the company from the ground up, driving product development, forging strategic partnerships, and leading successful integrations with global giants like Metro Cash & Carry, Coca-Cola, P&G, Colgate-Palmolive, and others.
