business analyst,"Over the course of nine months working as a business analyst at a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), I gained valuable experience and deep knowledge in creating and implementing automated solutions. My role was pivotal at all stages of project development, from gathering requirements to their implementation.
One of my key responsibilities was interacting with clients: I analyzed their business processes, helped identify pain points, and formulated specific tasks for automation. Communicating with clients allowed me not only to better understand their needs but also to accurately translate their requests into technical specifications (TS) so that the development team could efficiently execute the project.
In addition to writing technical specifications, I was involved in project evaluation, which included analyzing the scope of work, resources, and timelines. My work required careful planning and the ability to anticipate potential challenges, contributing to the successful completion of the projects.
Each project presented a unique challenge, and the opportunity to apply my knowledge across various business sectors significantly broadened my horizons and improved my skills in working with both clients and colleagues.
One of the significant achievements in my work was the successful completion of approximately 10 projects, all based on my documentation and assessments. Each of these projects was delivered on time, fully meeting the forecasts and expectations of the clients. This demonstrates not only my ability to accurately formulate requirements and create clear technical specifications but also my precision in estimating timelines and resources.
I expect my work to bring both satisfaction and a sense of purpose. It should not only be a source of professional growth but also a way to create value — for myself and for others.

I am proud of each project, each project version, each milestone, sprint and each successful client meeting. Of course, over the years, I have some cases that are the most different:
- government educational portal.
portal is a continuation of local schools, main functions - online report cards, login for students, teachers, parents, online textbooks, attendance too, also the possibility of group and individual chat between all participants of the platform.
Project was design from zero, was implemented day in and day out. It took six months and team of project manager+ business analyst, full stack php developer, 3 qa specialists. My role on this project was business analyst, product owner and project manager.
- Fintech online payment project. After doing a business analysis of requirements, I was offered a new model of platform work, changing the technology stack, improving system security and reliability, reducing transaction fees, changing the sign-up approach, which allowed for greater user conversion.
- online streaming platform. I discovered client needs and prototypes and proposed nexts points: I found empty parts of project (API payment system),
offered to separate admin part from mobile to web version, design project estimate and evaluation, and offered to optimize critical path by developing project by version, team of 2 developers, and parallel tasks. These proposals halved the development period and reduced the risks

business analyst,"As a Business Analyst, I have worked on several projects over the last four years. A few of the projects I worked on were warehouse accounting automation, integration with LMS for an Education project, introducing an app engagement program and technical support automation program for telecom, and implementation of a FinTech startup. My role in these projects was to work with business stakeholders and development teams to understand business processes and user needs, form the concept of projects, write business requirements, use cases, and user stories, as well as participate in presenting projects to committees and controlling their implementation.

Additionally, I delivered the development of Virtual and Physical Card functionality in collaboration with Visa and designed analytics modules integrated with databases and AWS services.
FinTech project
As an invited business analyst, I had partial experience in the development of the FinTech product - a platform that automates accounting for Sole proprietors.

business analyst,"An entry-level business analyst with over six years of experience in data research, where the key focus was identifying needs and analyzing potential customers of clients across various industries. Successfully managed teams ranging from three to twenty data researchers, ensuring compliance with search criteria, quality standards, and deadlines. Maintained effective communication between the team, the sales department, and clients.
Recently completed a business analysis course, gaining knowledge of SDLC models with a strong focus on the SCRUM framework, as well as skills in business requirements development, process modeling, and optimization using UML and BPMN.
Possess basic SQL knowledge for data analysis. Confident in working with spreadsheets and G-Suite. Strong critical thinking and communication skills.
A large client company was considering renewing their subscription to the service of the company I worked for, and the entire team understood that action needed to be taken to encourage them to do so. A month before their current contract ended, it was decided to involve more sales specialists who would handle a higher volume of emails and make more cold calls to potential buyers of the client’s product.
My task was to identify the industry in which the potential buyer companies were most likely to schedule the most appointments. The challenge was that, by this point in the project, we had already exhausted the most obvious industries for prospecting. Additionally, I needed to triple the volume of delivered work to meet the increased sales team’s need for new contacts.
After analyzing the market, I identified and aligned with the client on the industries that would bring us the best results. During the first two weeks, we focused on two new industries. Then, based on the most successful experience, we narrowed it down to one.
Through effective planning, which I completed in advance before the client’s contract expired, I prioritized my other ongoing projects and focused solely on this initiative three weeks before its potential completion. As a result, our team secured 17 appointments in less than a month, leading to the client renewing their subscription for another 12 months.
Another achievement I am proud of is solving an issue where data researchers on my team spent excessive time manually checking duplicates against exclusion lists or the existing database. This not only affected the overall time required to meet the weekly contact quota but also reduced the number of contacts, as some companies or leads could be overlooked. This resulted in them having to be excluded at the quality control stage.
My task was to help optimize this process. By implementing formulas for comparing data across related tables, I automated this routine task, reducing errors and improving the researchers’ efficiency in completing their weekly sprints.
I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience as a business analyst and contribute to successfully implementing IT projects."

business analyst,"I started my career in IT, performing various tasks primarily within the sales and business analysis spectrum.
As a Business Analyst, I was bridging the gap between clients and developers, keeping everyone aligned throughout the project. I gathered and refined clients' requirements, mapped out processes using BPMN, and created user story maps to visualize the customer journey. I'm skilled at analyzing data and visualizing solutions to find the best approaches. I'm comfortable with a range of tools that have helped me a lot in my work - from data visualization software like Power BI, Tableau,
and Looker to project management tools like Trello and Jira, to everyday workhorses like Excel and Google Sheets.
As the Sales Manager, I led a revamp of sales operations: crafting specific KPIs, reshaping lead acquisition, and adjusting the sales funnel and sales process to make them more agile and responsive to market trends. Subsequently, my involvement in pre-sales and sales, in addition to account management and customer success, allowed me to enhance the reliability and predictability of the sales process.
My additional besides-the-IT experience includes key roles in SGS - a big name in the Testing, Inspection & Certification industry. Not only was I dealing with top-tier clients and overseeing essential projects, but I was also busy selling complex B2B services. Along the way, my communication skills got a serious workout, as I was chatting with technical and non-technical colleagues alike. This journey gave me a bit of everything—contract navigation with lots of stakeholders on board, negotiation, problem-solving, and handling of budgets. Leading teams of over 130 members further highlights my people management skills.
Within the IT domain, the changes I implemented as a Sales Manager and Business Analyst paved the way for steady growth and a twofold increase in monthly customer acquisition within a year.
I'm looking for an ambitious company where I can use my skills to contribute to the company's growth and success. I want to work in an agile environment. I'd appreciate it if the company supports learning and encourages trying new stuff."

In my previous roles, my salary depended directly on my performance, as it included a fixed base and a percentage of sales or the profit margin I brought to the company.

I consider this one of my key achievements: my ability to learn quickly, adapt fast, and become a valuable contributor in a short time. I clearly remember how my managers praised me, saying no one had ever delivered results as effectively during the first months as I did. It was incredibly rewarding to receive such recognition for my work.

business analyst,"Developed 30+ projects, launched multiple projects and managed teams.

People come to me with an idea or with an existing product, in order to increase profitability, to create an effective model of work with the client and the team, to indicate future options for product development or consulting work.
From the brightest projects in which I had to participate I can note such as:
* Worked on a project on automation of agro-industrial complex processes for more than 3 years. This project was a professional challenge for me, requiring immersion in a new subject area. I had to learn a lot of terms, understand the specifics of the agribusiness industry, and find solutions that work effectively even in complex environments.
The project with a budget of 1.5 billion tenge became unique thanks to our team of 30 specialists (analysts, developers, testers, designers and project managers). We created a system that covers all aspects of agribusiness management and accounting.
* Creation and analytics of the module of auto loans, consumer loans, commodity loans in the banks of the country. As a result of this work analyzing the facts I can point out that the system was accepted with positive feedback from users of this service.
* System of analytics and instant marketing (realtime marketing) in conditions of traffic flow. This product had technical difficulties in realization considering factors of weather conditions, speed of flow, recognition of attributes of technical means and further processing of data with the purpose of showing effective advertising on media boards. I had to gather a team, look for ready-made services that can solve the issues, offer the best solutions in terms of finances and accuracy. As a result, at the end of the presentation the questions from the teams were exhausted, the development process was adapted and did not require other interventions in terms of analysis.

In the future, I want to develop in the areas of expanding my knowledge of Agile software development methodologies, improving my skills in defining business requirements and transforming them into clear and understandable technical specifications. I am also interested in learning more about test automation tools and improving project management processes to achieve better efficiency and quality of developed products.
My efforts have been focused on implementing best practices in requirements definition, which has improved communication with clients and reduced the time spent on requirements clarification.
Other achievements include the successful implementation of activity diagrams in the development process, which increased the understanding of tasks in the team and improved communication between project participants."

business analyst,"In my previous position, my responsibilities included collecting and analyzing information from customers, writing scripts for chatbot communication with users in mind-map format, creating technical documentation using prototypes, and interacting with the development team.
After analyzing the processes of writing technical documentation, I suggested creating interactive prototypes in Figma, which allowed us to test the functionality and get feedback from stakeholders at the initial stages of the project, and for clients it was an opportunity to see what the finished product would look like and make adjustments in time. This provided more flexibility in changing requirements and reduced the number of revisions after the main development was completed.

business analyst,"Business Analyst / Product Owner with a technical background and leadership experience.
Outcome-oriented Business Analyst with a technical background. Having worked almost 7 years as a QA Engineer, I decided to take on the responsibilities for the project's quality and success from the early stages, namely the product discovery and requirements management.
From 2010 to 2023 worked with USA customers in the healthcare domain - healthcare insurance, healthcare analytics, revenue management cycle.
Since from 2023 I've been working as Business Analyst and QA at the canadian consulting firm in association and membership management area.
My goal is to define the customer needs and draw the implementation pathway from the initial business idea to the technical implementation, making sure business and technical stakeholders understand each other during this journey.
Main job responsibilities:
- Fulfilled the BA role on 2-3 projects simultaneously: managed requirements throughout project lifecycle, aligned expectations between internal and external stakeholders on the daily bases.
- Analyzed data from 7+ disparate sources and guided integration of it into one data platform
- Elicited customer needs and negotiated requirements for building of a new patient web portal using consolidated data assets
- Maintained requirements for Revenue Cycle Management Analytics project for a USA health system
- Made business requirements clear to the technical experts ensuring shared understanding of goal
- Close collaboration with Client Services team to facilitate value driven decision making and priority setting via applying agile principles

- Coordinated up to 4 cross-team's efforts on the different features implementation within Product portfolio
- Did acceptance testing of the completed work and demos sessions
Because of the high quality of the developed web portal the client signed a new agreement to continue building their platform. This brought in over $650k additional dollars over the original contract term.

""I'm a Business Analyst with hands-on experience in business and system analysis. I've worked on researching marketplaces and building CRM and ERP tools. These tools help businesses better connect with their customers and make decisions using real data.
I've helped roll out features for their Finance, Marketing, and Logistics teams. It's been both challenging and rewarding. My job is to understand what's needed, break down tasks, keep track of our progress, and show our results to the people we work for. I oversee how we build and improve parts of the system.
I've also worked in real estate, helping to upgrade a CRM system. We did a bunch of projects, from generating new business leads, setting up a call center, to working with banks. We even made a system that can see if a customer is upset just from their face and connect them to our top salespeople.

One of the accomplishments I am most proud of is leading a comprehensive business intelligence project at my current telecommunications company, which significantly improved our customer retention rate.This strategy included personalized offers and improved customer service based on the data-driven insights from our dashboards. As a result, we reduced the churn rate by 15% within six months, which had a substantial positive impact on our revenue.
My expectations for my new job include opportunities for continuous learning, engaging in challenging projects, and being part of a supportive and innovative team. In my current position, while I have appreciated the experience, I feel that there is a lack of growth opportunities and room for creative problem-solving.

business analyst,"Hi there, dear recruiters!
I’m looking for a goal-oriented company - one that wants to grow, improve, and become stronger. Whether your team already has clear goals or is just starting to track them, I’d love to be part of that journey and help make it happen.
Here’s a quick look at my most relevant experience:
I’ve been working in B2B sales and business development for almost 7 years, mostly with tech companies. I’ve helped teams grow revenue, build strong relationships with clients, and improve how sales processes work. I’ve also built a sales department from scratch, so I know how to set up systems and scale them.
My main focus has been in outsourcing and outstaffing. I’ve done the full sales cycle: from lead generation and negotiations to closing deals and growing key accounts. I’ve signed high-value contracts through personalized outreach and by truly understanding what the client needs. I also created an account management system that helped keep clients happy and made internal work smoother.
I’ve worked closely with presale teams, helping shape offers and write proposals that win. Overall, I’ve got experience across the whole business development process - from the first contact to long-term cooperation.
My style is turning insights into clear actions that support growth and long-term success. That's why I'm proficient in data and business analysis.
Lately, I’ve also been involved in marketing, which gave me a fresh look at how sales and marketing can work better together.
On top of all that, I’m someone who really understands people. I’m empathic, and that helps me connect with clients and lead teams in a way that feels supportive and effective.
Everything I’ve learned so far helps me see the bigger picture and focus on what actually drives results.
So, if you’re still reading this, I hope we’re on the same page, and I’d be excited to connect!
- Increased annual revenue by 38% by improving sales strategy and focusing on high-potential clients.
- Reduced cost per lead by 75% through smarter lead generation and better qualification processes.
- Built a sales department from scratch, including hiring, training, and setting up workflows and KPIs.
- Closed multiple high-value B2B deals through personalized outreach and deep understanding of client needs.
- Developed an account management system that improved client retention and made internal communication more efficient.
- Grew average contract value by 15% through upselling and long-term client relationship building.
- Led a sales team that consistently met and exceeded monthly and quarterly targets.
- Worked closely with presale and marketing teams, helping create proposals and aligning sales with marketing strategies.
- Used data tools to track performance, analyze trends, and make better business decisions.
- I want to join a company that has clear goals and wants to grow.
- I’m looking for a company that’s transparent, honest, and works together to get things done.
- I want to use my experience in sales and business development to bring real results.
- I’d love to help set up or improve sales processes and make things work better and faster.

business analyst,"For over 13 years, I have been working in a variety of roles, primarily focused on project management, business analysis, and software testing, with extensive experience in developing CRM systems. My career has involved leading projects from inception to completion, ensuring that each phase—from requirements discussion to production installation—is executed efficiently. I have created comprehensive documentation throughout this process, including specifications, presentations, admin guides, user guides, test cases, and delivery plans.
In addition to my experience with CRM systems, I have successfully implemented projects in other domains, such as Human Resources and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. My work with banks has provided me with a strong understanding of their specific requirements.
I take pride in managing the testing and development processes/environments while also overseeing customer environments. My technical skills include building new versions in Jenkins, creating Docker containers, and deploying applications to servers, ensuring smooth and efficient software delivery.
I work closely with customers, supporting them by conducting thorough analyses of their problems and needs. This includes identifying the root causes of issues—whether they stem from bugs or highlight missing functionalities—and proposing appropriate solutions. I have also been involved in API testing using Postman, which has given me a basic understanding of integration layers, further enhancing my ability to bridge communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Moreover, I manage the reporting aspect of the applications we develop. This involves analyzing data, transforming it for reporting purposes, and creating detailed reports and charts that provide valuable insights for stakeholders.
While I aim to grow primarily as a Business Analyst, I am also enthusiastic about contributing to the full project lifecycle, from gathering requirements to delivering high-quality solutions to customers.
1. In a significant project, the requirements discussion phase alone spanned approximately 1.5 months. This project faced challenging implementation phases that required fine-tuning throughout its duration. Ultimately, the delivery resulted in a remarkable increase in efficiency for the customer—up to 30%. I played a crucial role in the requirements gathering, project management, and testing teams, gaining extensive experience as a Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Tester.
2. In another project for a client, we focused on merging several companies acquired by the customer. The goal was to ensure a smooth and seamless transition to a new CRM system, including integrating with their existing core systems. My responsibilities included participating in the requirements gathering, project management, and testing phases, further enhancing my experience as a Project Manager, Business Analyst, and Tester.
3. I was involved in a performance optimization project for one of our clients, where we aimed to achieve a specific speed for message processing. In this role, I served as a key member of the testing team and acted as the main liaison between the customer and the developers.
I want to get new knowledge, as well as get usage of my knowledge and skills properly."
