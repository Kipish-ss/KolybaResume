fullstack,"Hi, I have been a Full-Stack JavaScript developer for over 3.5 years. During this time, I have:
• Developed a dashboard from scratch with a complex UI that includes graphs, charts, tables, and a calendar with functionality to create, edit, and manage recurring events. The dashboard supports custom email creation, push notifications, and tree-view management for teams and customers. This project required optimized database queries, authentication using JWT tokens, Google SSO, and Microsoft SSO, and integration with external APIs.
• Created and maintained new features for the main application, including integrating it with Microsoft Teams, which helped attract new clients.
• Developed a real-time car auction platform with real-time bidding capabilities, using technologies such as WebSockets and REST APIs for seamless user interactions.
• Built a web scraper with automatic proxy switching for security and anonymity, simulating real user interactions on various websites to collect, process, and clean data before storing it in a database.
• Optimized and automated internal business processes to minimize human error, save time, and increase the company’s capacity to handle more orders. This involved working with large datasets, processing files, and integrating external APIs.
• Gained experience in writing complex and detailed technical requirements. In my case, it was for UI/UX designers.
• Provided mentorship and shared knowledge with colleagues, improving team skills and collaboration.
So, I would be happy to discuss potential collaboration opportunities or job propositions. Something exciting, complex, and interesting.
Have a nice and calm day :)

• Implemented new features in the app that resulted in a 30% increase in user engagement.
• I was part of the company's app development, which we did in a very short time, but as a result, we got 100 new interested customers in the first months after realizing this app.
• Developed an application for automating internal business processes, which significantly optimized and automated the company's work, which significantly reduced the time spent by an employee on the same work by about 60 times, allowing the company to handle 75% more orders than before.
• I have never written large technical specifications, but I managed to write a large (50-60 pages) technical task for a UI/UX designer.
• I also mentored a person in full stack development (teaching, sharing my experience, creating a curriculum, etc.) and now the person successfully fulfills orders on the freelance.
I want to work on interesting and complex tasks that motivate me to develop and learn new things. I like to be part of a team where everyone is passionate about what they do and works together to create a great product or improve an already existing product. I appreciate companies that not only value their employees but are also willing to invest in them, for me it's very cool.
I am ready to put in the effort and work hard and enthusiastically, especially when I see that my work is beneficial and helps the product become better. It is important for me to feel that I am doing something meaningful.
I would not want to work in outsourcing, where there is often no sense of belonging to the project and where it is difficult to feel your contribution to the final result. I also want to avoid a toxic environment where there is no support etc."

fullstack,"While working at my last job, I was tasked with radically redesigning an internal web application that no longer met the company's modern requirements. It was necessary to create a new web application from scratch that would provide improved optimization, high performance, and a modern interface and functionality. I was tasked with designing a complete architecture, developing both the frontend - with the implementation of a new interface - and the backend - creating a server and database, and ensuring integration with 1C. This was all done through close cooperation with an interface designer and a 1C programmer.
Main tasks:
- Backend. Developed the server side using Node.js and Express.js in TypeScript, ensuring efficient request processing and integration with the database;
- Frontend. Created the user interface on ReactJS using Material UI for modern design, and also used Redux Toolkit
to manage the state of the application;
- Design. The interface design was developed by a professional designer. I created the application according to the provided design and actively discussed its
details;
- Database. I designed a database based on PostgreSQL.
- Integration. I worked closely with a 1C programmer to organize interaction with the 1C database, which allowed me to receive the necessary requests for the backend;
- Version control and documentation. Used GitHub for version control, tested the application using Jest, and created
documentation using Swagger to support the development process;
Thanks to a holistic approach to architecture design, close cooperation with the designer and effective use of modern technologies, we managed to achieve a significant improvement in the performance and quality of the developed web application.
Before starting this work, I worked commercially as a freelancer for 2 years, and fulfilled various orders to create both front-end and back-end for various, not too complicated purposes. Most of the projects were implemented for university students and friends.

My main responsibilities include developing and maintaining integrations with marketplaces (eBay, Amazon, Etsy, etc.), building modules for order management, shipping logistics, and customer support, as well as creating flexible UI interfaces using Vue 3. On the backend, I work with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I’m also actively involved in architecture design, product discussions, and code reviews.
In addition, I have an active Upwork profile that I used to take on small to mid-sized freelance projects, which I stopped actively pursuing about two years ago. I’ve earned over $14,000 through the platform and consistently received positive feedback from clients. Working independently and communicating directly with clients helped me strengthen my time management, communication, and problem-solving skills.
I’m looking for a company that provides clear, realistic tasks and fair time estimates. I value a product-oriented approach where quality matters, and I’d like to contribute to technical and architectural decisions. A healthy work-life balance is also important to me."
