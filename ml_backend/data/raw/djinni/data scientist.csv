data scientist,"Throughout my career as a Machine Learning Engineer, I have been involved in various projects, taking on diverse roles throughout the entire project lifecycle. My portfolio encompasses essential business applications of machine learning, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Fraud Detection, Credit Risk Scoring, and Network Optimization. The following is list of projects I have worked on:
1) I developed secure, on-premises solutions using 8-bit quantized Llama2 for document interaction and an HR assistant that streamlined recruitment by processing diverse CV formats and ranking candidates, all while ensuring data protection and resilience.
2) I developed a novel SIMBOX Fraud Detection model to address a critical challenge for the company. This involved navigating through tens of millions of customer transaction records over several months to unlock highly meaningful and interpretable patterns. The most challenging aspect of the project was dealing with the inherent class imbalance that exists in ML application domains like fraud. Tackled the challenge with SMOTE (targeted oversampling) to achieve a precision and recall score of 0.83 and 0.81 respectively. Designed and implemented an inference data pipeline to support hourly detections, with model results communicated to stakeholders via SMS, Email, and dashboards.
3) I led the development of an in-house credit risk scoring model designed to gauge the device creditworthiness of customers. The most challenging aspects of this project were the extraction and preparation of revenue-generating customer transactions spanning several months, the lack of credit performance data, and its financial sensitivity. Given these challenges, I opted to develop expert scorecards that align with targeted customer behaviors as per the project BRD. This approach required thoughtful and extensive exploratory data analysis, as well as collaboration and communication with the respective business unit.
4) I have also worked on a Network Optimization Project, predicting a key network congestion parameter 15 days in advance to enable proactive adjustments and prevent potential network quality issues. After a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), I identified temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and lagged relationships in the data, leading me to model the problem as a time series forecasting task. I chose Prophet for its robustness with large mean shifts, speed, and intuitive out-of-the-box interpretability.
In a recent achievement, I played a crucial role as a Machine Learning Engineer in Team NetiX at the Safaricom Telecommunications Ethiopia PLC hackathon, where we utilized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures and large language resume_classifier (LLMs) to streamline complex and repetitive tasks in telecommunications. Our innovative solution earned us first place among over 500 teams, advancing us to the African Finals hosted by Vodacom Group.

data scientist,"Stock Portfolio:
I worked on a project for ATAfrica, to identify the optimal portfolio of technology stocks from the S&P 500 index.
The objective was to find the best risk-return trade-off by constructing portfolios along the minimum variance frontier.
This involved the data analysis of the average monthly returns and risks associated with each stock in the technology sector and determining the optimal mix that maximizes returns for a given level of risk.
A machine learning model can be developed to forecast the average monthly returns of different stocks.
Spain-Renewable Energy-gap Prediction using Advanced Regression:
In this project, we developed a predictive machine learning model for the Spanish government to forecast the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and renewable sources. This shortfall is critical in transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy and reducing reliance on non-renewable sources for electricity generation.
The model used city-specific weather features (such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, etc.) to predict the daily shortfall.
Various regression resume_classifier, including Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, and Random Forest Regression, were trained and evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R-squared score.
The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) addressed high multicollinearity in temperature features.
The best-performing machine learning model was deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance using a Flask API to make it accessible to the client.
I worked on a Stock portfolio project where the outcome was a Jupyter Notebook that displayed a plot of the Average Monthly Returns of the Optimal Stock Portfolio. The Python data analysis revealed that NVIDIA had the highest average monthly returns, followed by Monolithic Power Systems. This visualization helped in identifying the stocks that provided the best risk-return trade-off within the technology sector of the S&P 500.
Collaborated with a remote team using Git and Agile methodology to perform data analysis on city-wide weather data from Spain (2015-2017) with Python. Built and optimized machine learning resume_classifier to predict energy shortfalls, achieving a top 8 position on the Kaggle leaderboard with an RMSE of 0.92. Deployed a Flask API on AWS EC2 for model predictions.
I look forward to working on a team with a growth mindset."

data scientist,"As a Research Assistant at eiLink R&D Center in Baku, Azerbaijan, I worked on multiple data-driven projects aimed at optimizing operational efficiency in the ShahDeniz gas field. I preprocessed and cleaned large datasets from various sensors, including ASD readings, Downhole Pressure, and Production Choke measurements, spanning seven years of data. One of my key contributions was developing and deploying an Autoencoder-based sand detection tool integrated with rule-based ensembles. This tool achieved exceptional accuracy—over 98% for surface wells and 93% for subsea wells—and has been adopted by BP ShahDeniz field engineers, significantly improving sand management practices and operational safety. Additionally, I analyzed seismic and Techlog data to improve geological modeling, clustered over 200 wells for optimal training sample selection, and employed Graph Neural Networks to predict porosity in theoretical wells. Beyond technical development, I led a team of two researchers to ensure the tool's stability post-launch and collaborated with stakeholders to implement enhancements.
At ADA University, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Machine Learning course, where I actively supported over 40 students in their academic journey. My responsibilities included conducting lab sessions to clarify complex concepts, preparing assignments and exam questions, and providing detailed feedback on student submissions. I also assisted students in resolving technical challenges and fostered a collaborative learning environment to enhance their understanding of machine learning.
When it comes to the projects, one of my most impactful projects I worked on was developing a non-invasive diabetes detection model using iris imaging. I spent over two months collecting diverse iris images at a local hospital in Azerbaijan to augment the dataset. Using Graph Neural Networks, I achieved an average accuracy of 92% on public datasets of right-eye images. I also developed a prototype Flask application to streamline the submission of iris images for real-time diabetes predictions, demonstrating the potential of this approach in healthcare diagnostics.
In another project, I proposed a dynamic KNN-Graph Neural Network framework for image classification, which achieved 94.31% accuracy on the EMNIST dataset. By introducing a learnable KNN parameter, I enabled adaptive and context-aware graph structures, significantly improving model performance compared to benchmarks.
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have achieved significant milestones that reflect my dedication to excellence and innovation. I was honored to receive the ""State Program for the Education of Youth at Prestigious Universities of Foreign Countries"" scholarship in 2024, recognizing my academic achievements and potential. At ADA University, I consistently performed at a high level, earning a place on the Dean's List from 2022 to 2024. My work has been recognized in international forums, with publications like ""Diabetes Detection Based on Iridology"" presented at the IEEE AICT Conference in Turin, Italy, and ""Real-Time Sand Detection for Gas Wells Using AI Applications,"" showcased at GOTECH in Dubai.
My technical expertise is validated by certifications such as the TensorFlow Developer Certificate from Google and the TensorFlow Developer Specialization from DeepLearning.AI. I have also earned credentials in Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Tools for Data Science, and advanced analytics. These accomplishments highlight my ability to apply cutting-edge techniques to solve complex problems, as demonstrated in my projects and professional roles.
I take pride in my leadership abilities and collaborative mindset, evident in my role as a Computer Science Senator in the Undergraduate Student Government at ADA University. There, I successfully proposed and initiated programming bootcamps for students of various majors. This initiative reflects my commitment to fostering growth and skill development in others while addressing broader community needs."

data scientist,"Worked on different projects with Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, LLM, Disease Classification, Time Series Forecasting, Anomaly Detection and other technologies. Had extensive experience with LLM resume_classifier. Trained them for different tasks for example, game assistant, sales assistant, internal assitant and other tasks."
data scientist,"I'm switching to Data Science after over a decade of diverse experience in tech, including roles in software quality assurance, project management, and chatbot development.
Recently I finished a self-educational program which, among other things, included a review of the mathematical foundations for data science and machine learning, and DS/ML projects to gain practical experience in solving real-life problems. For example, in the Electricity Price Forecasting Challenge, I utilised various machine learning algorithms, including regression resume_classifier, decision tree ensembles, and neural networks using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras libraries. This project also involved data visualisation (with Plotly), cleaning, imputation, and transformation, as well as feature engineering and hyperparameter optimisation.
As I was curious about LLMs, I first gained theoretical knowledge on the topic and then built a simplified version of GPT-2 from scratch using PyTorch following Andrej Karparty's guide. While implementing the basic LLM, I gained practical experience in natural language processing, tokenisation, transformer architecture implementation and large language model pre-training. Later I also deepened my knowledge of LLMs by finetuning a pre-trained SmalLM-135M with Llama-like architecture to correct grammar. I used Hugging Face libraries to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning with the CoEdIT dataset and to align fine-tuned LLM by applying Direct Preference Optimisation and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization, where it achieved a BLEU score of 0.48.
A few months ago, after finishing the self-study program, I applied for the Cohere for AI Scholarship Program for aspiring AI researchers worldwide. I passed two very technically heavy stages of application and got to the last one but eventually, I didn't get one of the only few available spots on the program. Nevertheless, thanks to the application just in a few weeks of very intensive studying and coding I learned a lot about modern research on LLM quantisation, transformer architecture, LLM fine-tuning/alignment methods and managed to fix bugs in Llama implementation and fine-tune it to correct grammatical mistakes. I found it an accomplishment for a person who self-studied machine learning just recently and never did any commercial coding to be able to progress so quickly.
I want to kick-start my Data Scientist career by joining a company that already has a Data Science department with an experienced leader. I'm happy to work hard on interesting real-world tasks and learn on the go. I'm very capable of acquiring new knowledge and skills quickly as I'm a seasoned self-learner and have over a decade of precious work experience in tech."
