rust,"I've worked on a variety of projects as a full stack Rust developer, freelance Coda docs builder, and web content writer. The following is a summary of my work:
Projects & Tasks Completed:
- I developed multi-bot high-frequency trading engines using Rust, leveraging Solana's OpenBook V1 and V2 programs for efficient crypto trading.
- After winning the Coda Hackathon, I created and implemented automated systems for clients, collaborating with companies like Imaginary Space and TriviaLAB using tools such as Zapier and Make.
- I built and optimized web-based APIs with FastAPI, Django, and ReactJS. I also set up continuous integration and deployment systems with Github and Docker, improving development speed.
- I authored technical books and articles on Rust topics such as Rust Polars and data analysis, simplifying topics like machine learning for a wider audience.
Technologies I've Used:
Frontend: Rust, EGUI RS, Leptos, Yew, ReactJS, Wasm Web Socks, Solana Wasm Client
Backend: Rust, FastAPI, Django, Axum, OpenBook DEX, Python, Nginx, MySQL
Automation: Zapier, Make, Coda, Gmail Automation
DevOps & Infra: Docker, Docker-Compose, Railway, Redis, Celery, Github Hooks, CI/CD
Networking & Protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP, Zenoh, NDN, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, IoT/IoE
My Role in the Team:
In my current roles as a full stack Rust developer and freelance Coda docs builder, I handle both frontend and backend development, creating scalable solutions and enhancing workflows for global clients. I also contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with clients to meet their goals.
What I Want to Improve:
I aim to further develop my skills in blockchain and smart contract development, particularly in decentralized apps and layer-2 solutions. I also want to enhance scalability in Rust projects and explore more advanced automation systems, potentially integrating AI-based solutions for real-time data processing.
I'm proud of my diverse skill set and always looking for new opportunities to improve and innovate in both freelance and full-time roles.
I've successfully developed high-performance multi-bot trading engines using Rust for crypto trading on the Solana blockchain, leveraging OpenBook V1 and V2. After winning the Coda Hackathon, I collaborated with over 10 global clients, implementing automated systems with tools like Zapier and Make, which streamlined workflows and improved productivity. Additionally, I created secure web-based APIs using FastAPI and Django, and optimized deployment processes by implementing CI/CD pipelines with Github and Docker. My technical writing has simplified complex topics such as Rust data analysis and machine learning for a broader audience.
I'm looking for opportunities that allow me to continuously innovate, particularly in blockchain and decentralized technologies, with a focus on Rust. I value creative, challenging work where I can contribute both frontend and backend expertise, especially on scalable and high-performance systems. A collaborative environment that fosters growth and encourages knowledge-sharing is important to me.
However, I prefer to avoid rigid, overly bureaucratic environments where innovation is stifled. I also want to avoid roles that focus purely on maintenance work without opportunities for learning or development."

And it is important for me to keep work/life balance:)."
rust,"Currently, my experience is limited to my own projects, participation in trainings, and small contributions to open-source projects.
However, I continue to actively learn and acquire new knowledge and skills, applying them in practice.
So far, my biggest achievement is the development of my own project: Embroiderly, a free, open-source, cross-platform desktop application for designing cross-stitch patterns that already has a large community of active users.
In general, the field of embroidery software is not very evolved and is mostly obsolete (both technically and practically). There are also not enough open resources in this area that could help develop new solutions.
So I am focusing a lot on developing open specifications for cross-stitch pattern file formats and parsers so that anyone can also use my work and develop better solutions."

rust,"I had experience on several projects as a Python Backend developer.
First project - VPN company. We were moving their backend from Perl to Python. (It begun with reimplementing their PKI infrastructure, but they switched the task to backend migration).
I've got a chance to learn a bit about PKI and Certificates, DNS, Detection services. Partially rewrote some Perl package, that i could not find as part of Python ecosystem.
- ~7 months
- The second one was a company that worked with ads, which needed a software to recalculate bids by special algorithm  and update values on remote services through API, such as Ironsource. There was one another service(which i dont remember) which had slightly different API.
I made a CLI app for this purpose.
~ 2months
