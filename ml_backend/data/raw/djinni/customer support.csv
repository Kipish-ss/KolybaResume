customer support,"I am 17.6 years old and I am just starting my journey in IT. While I don’t have commercial experience yet, I am ready to register as a sole proprietor (FOP) if necessary to begin my career.
After completing the 9th grade, I enrolled in college to study Computer Science because I have always been fascinated by technology and gadgets. Additionally, my mentor, who has been working in IT for five years, played a significant role in influencing my career choice.
To make the most of my time, I started attending courses as early as the 8th grade to improve my English and technical skills. Throughout my studies, I have gained foundational knowledge in the following areas:
• Cybersecurity
• SQL
• Windows installation and configuration
• Hardware components
• 3D graphics and modeling
• Technical/Customer Support knowledge
• Web development (PHP, HTML, JavaScript)
• Programming (Java, C++, C#, Python)
• English (B1 level)
I am eager to grow in the IT field, continuously improving my skills and taking on new challenges. My main interests lie in software development, cybersecurity and data analysis. I am looking forward to gaining my first commercial experience and becoming part of the IT community.
My key achievements are related to continuous learning, practical experience and applying acquired knowledge in real projects.
I have actively attended courses since school, which allowed me to improve my English proficiency and gain foundational knowledge in programming, cybersecurity, and web development.
During my college studies, I participated in various practical experiences, including:
• Programming: Worked on academic projects using Java, C++, C#, and Python, which enhanced my coding skills and ability to collaborate in a team.
• Internship in government institutions: Gained hands-on experience in setting up computer equipment, installing software and ensuring cybersecurity in public sector organizations.
• Building and configuring hardware from scratch: Assembled computers from individual components, configured systems and troubleshot technical issues.
This experience not only helped me understand how IT infrastructure works but also improved my analytical thinking, problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. I am eager to continue developing my expertise, gaining new knowledge, and applying it in real-world projects.
From my first job, I expect the opportunity to start my journey in IT, actively learn and grow. It is important for me to work in a strong and supportive team that will push me to develop quickly and help me achieve both personal and team goals.
I also want to have a great mentor who will guide me through processes, share valuable experience and support my professional growth.
Additionally, I am looking for a company that I can be proud of, where I can gain my first commercial experience and contribute to its success. In return, I am ready to be fully dedicated to my team and my work, putting in maximum effort to achieve outstanding results."

customer support,"After finishing Senior Secondary School, I worked as an Office Assistant at Believers Destiny Academy in Gaborone for five months. In this capacity, I organized files, handled mail, and helped teachers with day-to-day school operations. My responsibilities also included keeping records and assisting with school activities to guarantee smooth day-to-day operations.
I eventually worked for Superior Tuition Center in Gaborone as a Mathematics and Sciences Tutor for two months. I worked with students one-on-one and in groups to help them understand complicated mathematics and scientific subjects. I created lesson plans that were suited to individual learning requirements and offered academic support to help students improve their performance.
I also served as Minister of Student Welfare at Botswana International University of Science and Technology for a year. In this leadership position, I was responsible for resolving student welfare problems, such as managing stipend inquiries, campaigning for the rehabilitation of outdated hostels, and improving general living conditions on campus. I collaborated closely with university management to identify answers for students experiencing financial difficulties and promoted talks on social welfare programs to improve the student experience.
During my tenure as an Office Assistant at Believers Destiny Academy, I established a system in which weekly plans were shared ahead of time, allowing for greater preparation and less downtime. This increased overall efficiency in the school. In addition, I implemented a hierarchical file system, which improved document retrieval speed and organization.
As a Mathematics and Sciences Tutor at Superior Tuition Center, I helped students improve their performance. Through tailored lesson planning and targeted academic support, I helped students considerably increase their grasp of essential topics, resulting in noteworthy grade gains.
As Minister of Student Welfare at Botswana International University of Science and Technology, I successfully lobbied for the construction of backup power systems to minimize disruptions to academic activity. I also tried to bridge the gap between government sponsors and students, which allowed for greater communication and faster resolution of stipend-related issues. In addition, I helped to reduce response times for maintenance personnel to handle campus defects, therefore enhancing students' living and studying environments.
Expectations: I want to work in an atmosphere that promotes growth and cooperation, allowing me to contribute meaningfully to projects and initiatives. I cherish chances for ongoing learning and professional growth, whether via training programs or mentorships. In addition, I am looking for a supportive culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion, and in which all team members are recognized and given the opportunity to flourish.
Non-Expectations: I like a work setting without micromanagement or lack of openness. I cherish autonomy and believe in my ability to do my work successfully, and I thrive in cultures that promote open communication and mutual respect. Furthermore, I avoid businesses that do not promote work-life balance, since I feel that a good balance between work and personal life is critical for general well-being and productivity."

customer support,"With a solid background in customer support and program operations, I bring over three years of experience in customer service/Support providing excellent service to diverse clients across the tech and startup ecosystem. At Salaria Sales Solutions, I work remotely as an Outreach Associate, where I manage client communications, schedule meetings, and use tools like Salesforce, Front Spinner, and Slack to streamline engagement. Previously, I held roles at Sand Technologies and Iceaddis that involved managing learning experiences, coordinating events, and responding to learner and partner needs with precision and empathy. I’ve also supported users as a System Administrator at GeezJobs and interned at the African Union’s MIS department, where I resolved tech-related issues and maintained internal systems. Across all roles, I’ve demonstrated strong communication, problem-solving, and multitasking skills making sure users feel supported, informed, and heard. I thrive in fast-paced environments and bring a calm, solutions-focused mindset to every customer interaction.
During my time at Salaria Sales Solutions, I consistently scheduled over 15 successful meetings per week, connecting potential clients with our sales team to explore partnership opportunities. By personalizing my outreach approach and refining my messaging, I managed to boost client response rates by 20%. I kept detailed records of every interaction using Salesforce and FrontSpin, which helped me stay organized and ensure no lead slipped through the cracks. Handling objections became second nature, and I often turned hesitant prospects into solid leads by actively listening and addressing their concerns. Balancing multiple conversations across different time zones was challenging, but with careful planning and follow-ups, I maintained smooth communication and secured meaningful connections.
I'm looking for a role where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with a supportive team, and have opportunities to grow my skills.

Маю глибокий досвід у побудові клієнтських сервісів у сфері просування особистих брендів та запуску інфопродуктів. За час роботи створила 5 повноцінних клієнтських сервісів з нуля, що охоплювали всі ключові етапи взаємодії зі студентами — від першого контакту до завершення навчання.
У моєму підпорядкуванні було понад 25 співробітників, для яких я особисто розроблювала зони відповідальності, ставила задачі, будувала структуру команд, проводила навчання та адаптацію. Усі етапи підбору персоналу — від співбесід до онбордингу — також були повністю на мені.
Завдяки впровадженим підходам та фокусу на якість сервісу, рівень задоволеності клієнтів досягав 4,9 із 5. Це стало можливим не лише завдяки сильній команді, а й через автоматизацію баз даних, яку я реалізувала через системи на базі різних таблиць, що дозволило підвищити ефективність та прозорість роботи.
Окрім сервісної частини, маю досвід у покращенні продуктової лінійки — через тісний зворотний зв’язок із клієнтами, аналіз болей та очікувань, я ініціювала та реалізовувала зміни, які позитивно впливали на конверсію, утримання та фінальні результати клієнтів.
Моє головне досягнення — це системне будівництво сервісів “з нуля”, які не лише витримували високі навантаження, а й забезпечували залучення клієнтів та позитивні результати."

My Name is Levan, and I would like to tell you about my background.
I am currently a student at Georgian Technical University, as well as a dedicated sportsman and fitness enthusiast. I am excited to share my past experiences with you.
My first role was as a car import specialist. I was responsible for purchasing vehicles at auctions, supervising their shipment, coordinating with mechanics to ensure quality repairs at affordable prices, and selling the cars at a profit. This experience enhanced my organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to deliver results under pressure.
I later joined Borusan CAT as a CVA Specialist. My tasks included coordinating maintenance schedules, booking mechanics, optimizing routes, and ensuring the availability of tools and parts. This role improved my planning, communication, and problem-solving abilities.
After that, I worked at AutoMarket Logistics as a sales manager. I helped clients select vehicles that suited their needs, designed payment plans, and assisted them in making their final decisions. This position helped me further develop my sales, negotiation, and client relationship skills.
I took a brief break from work to prepare for an amateur international kickboxing championship, which I am proud to say I won. This achievement reflects my discipline, perseverance, and ability to balance multiple commitments.

My responsibilities included communicating with clients, assisting them with individual issues, processing refunds, and providing information about company policies. This role enhanced my ability to be helpful and adaptable in various customer interactions.
I also volunteer as a coach at my kickboxing gym, where I help newcomers develop their skills and train them. This experience has helped me strengthen my communication and mentoring skills, as I work with individuals at different skill levels to support their growth and success in the sports.
What I learned from my previous roles and experiences has shown me that anything I try to achieve is possible. My work ethic and ability to develop new skills are among my best qualities. Additionally, my achievements in sports demonstrate my resolve and discipline.
What I want from work is a flexible schedule and a positive, friendly environment. Additionally, I value opportunities for growth and development. I’m not looking for a job that only provides a paycheck. I want a role that offers meaningful experiences and the chance to improve myself professionally."

customer support,"My first serious job was Graphic Assistant. As a graphic design assistant, I helped the lead graphic designer complete all print, online, and electronic media projects. I prepared marketing materials, created print layouts, gave creative input, developed logos and images, and designed promotional tools. The career requires graphic design experience, often gained in internships. Then I found better perspectives working as a Community Manager. My main tasks included chatting with people, advertising products on different social media, assessing the target audience, and finding quick solutions to occurring problems. While working as CM I received an offer from my top management to start working in Customer Care but for another project. In support, I was providing product/service information, answering questions, resolving any emerging problems that our customer accounts might face with accuracy and efficiency, managing large amounts of messages, and providing accurate valid, and complete information by using the right methods/tools, identifying and assess customers needs to achieve satisfaction, following communication procedures, guidelines and policies, handling customer complaints, providing appropriate solutions and alternatives within the time limits, follow up to ensure resolution, taking the extra mile to engage customers. While working as a support I received an amazing offer to try myself as a Guerilla marketing manager. My tasks include management of my department, assessment of workers' skills and results, preparation of all important documents and manuals for better working process, analyzing of working reports, creation of working strategy, creation of positive atmosphere and relationships among employees, making interviews with new workers, and mentoring them during their probation.

I have a Polish Bachelor's degree in Economics and a Ukrainian Master's degree in Entrepreneurship, and at the moment I`m finishing my Master's degree in business management in Portugal.

I`m an organized young person with a strong sense of responsibility

Technical support/writer
After joining the project, I changed the processes by organizing daily calls for the team, during which we analyzed cases and learned something new related to the product daily. As I got to know the product, I quickly managed to prepare a product documentation based on which I created a technical documentation for the support team and for onboarding newcomers, which I fully designed, wrote and managed myself in Confluence. I also recorded 15 lectures on the product which can be accessible by new employees to quickly dive into understanding the product. I pushed the idea among the management that each support team member needs their own sandbox to test the company's product to better understand customers' problems, which was also implemented. I actively analyzed problems in the processes between different departments and the functioning of products and their flows and presented it to the management, which in general significantly improved the interaction and communication between the support and development teams and clients. And all this with a 100% customer satisfaction rate in live chats and Zendesk tickets.

customer support,"I’m currently working as a Customer Support Specialist in a crypto fintech company, where my focus has naturally shifted toward compliance-related tasks—especially those connected with user verification, risk assessment, and transaction reviews.
My day-to-day work includes communicating with English-speaking clients and helping them resolve a wide range of questions, most often related to transactions and KYC procedures. I guide users through the verification process, consult on acceptable documents based on their country and situation, explain regulatory requirements in a clear and supportive way, and assist with resubmissions if needed.
In addition to standard user support, I regularly handle flagged transactions. I reach out to clients to collect details about the source of funds, request supporting documentation, and provide guidance on what information is needed and why. This process helps us stay compliant with AML regulations and ensures that risks are properly identified and escalated when necessary.
I have a solid understanding of KYC processes and risk management principles, and I take an active role in solving complex verification cases in close collaboration with our compliance and payments teams. I’m confident in my ability to spot unusual patterns, ask the right questions, and communicate clearly with both users and internal stakeholders.
Beyond my direct responsibilities, I continuously expand my knowledge in the field of compliance by studying best practices, reviewing real-life cases, and staying updated on changes in crypto regulations and global KYC standards.
I’m now ready to transition into a more focused role—where I can apply my hands-on experience and growing expertise to support a company’s KYC operations more directly, improve internal processes, and contribute to building a secure and trustworthy financial platform.
1. Improved KYC pass rates by providing clearer document instructions and support, leading to a smoother onboarding experience.
2. Regularly managed communication for high-risk cases, collecting sensitive financial information and maintaining client trust.
3. Actively contributed to internal process improvements related to KYC handling and knowledge sharing.
4. Self-trained in compliance fundamentals, which helped me handle tasks beyond the scope of typical support responsibilities.
5. Consistently met KPIs while handling additional tasks without compromising service quality.
I’m looking for a role where I can grow within the compliance and KYC field, take on more responsibility in verification and risk-related processes, and contribute to building secure, user-friendly onboarding flows.
I’m especially interested in moving from a support-focused role to a more specialized position where I can deepen my knowledge of AML regulations, gain hands-on experience with compliance tools, and make a meaningful impact on internal processes and the overall user experience."

I look forward to contributing to the strategic growth of the support department by implementing scalable processes and optimizing workflows.
I expect to collaborate with cross-functional teams to address customer feedback and improve the customer journey. My goal is to create a proactive support environment, empower the team through effective training, and use KPIs to monitor and improve performance.

What I Want to Improve:

I recognized the need for a centralized resource that could facilitate faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries. To address this, I led the development and implementation of an extensive knowledge base, which contained frequently asked questions, troubleshooting guides, and best practices.
This initiative had a significant impact on our customer support operations. It not only reduced the average resolution time by 30%, but it also empowered our support agents to provide more consistent and effective assistance, resulting in a notable increase in customer satisfaction ratings. Moreover, this knowledge base proved to be an invaluable tool for onboarding new team members, enabling them to quickly get up to speed and start contributing to our customer support efforts.
My aspiration is to join a well-respected organization in a role that allows me to actively contribute to the realization of the company's vision. I am eager to apply my expertise to implementing high-quality practices that prioritize customer satisfaction.

customer support,"Experienced Customer Support Specialist with strong expertise in order investigations, onboarding, risk management, and technical support for trading platforms such as Sterling, DAS, TradeZero, and Takeon.
I am detail-oriented, analytical, and highly effective in dynamic environments where problem-solving and precision are crucial. My experience includes trader support, assistance with market processes, and automation of client interactions, helping to optimize workflows and reduce the workload on support teams.
With a strong technical background, I am constantly looking for ways to improve customer service efficiency and enhance onboarding procedures. I believe in clear communication, proactive problem-solving, and continuous learning.
In my opinion, I haven’t achieved anything I would call a big success yet.
I live an active lifestyle, go to therapy, do sports, and have chosen to avoid fast content on social media to keep my mind clear and control my information space. I am goal-oriented, always ready to learn new things, but I also understand the importance of balancing work and rest.
For me, real achievements are the health and happiness of my family, having my own home, and raising smart children who will find their own path in life. Everything else is just part of the journey toward this goal.
I am open to opportunities where I can apply my experience not only in operational work but also in strategic team development and process improvement."

customer support,"Dear Recruiter,
I started working as a Customer Support Manager in September 2017.  For 5 years, I was a CSM, Senior CSM, Quality Assurance Manager, and CS Team Leader.
For now, I am managing the international CS Team (Chinese-speaking) in a crypto mining company. We aim to provide efficient tech (mining-related) support to our customers in China.
During these 5 years, I have worked for Ed-Tech, Gambling and Mining projects. My responsibilities included:
1. Communication with customers from China (in Chinese), USA and Europe & handling complex requests;
2. Building and maintaining strong, long-lasting relationships, working on customers’ loyalty.
3. Adaptation, onboarding and mentoring new-comers, off-boarding process for CS team and supply agents;
4. Quality evaluation and assessments, 1*1 meetings for the CS team aimed at improving the quality of the service;
5. Develop schedules, a motivation system within the team, including a personal development plan (moving from Junior grade to Middle, etc);
6. Setting & tracking main KPIs/OKRs;
7. Creating communication flow between departments to ease and speed up problem resolution and updates exchange;
8. Creating documentation, like CS instructions and notes, product descriptions;
9. Identifying bottlenecks and complex areas in processes, cooperating with teams to find the best solution;
10. Cooperating with the Product Team, took part in hypothesis testing.
In August 2022, I completed a Brand Management course, and am actively implementing the knowledge gained there into the work, for example in terms of communication strategy & tone of voice. Besides that, now I understand how branding works and how important it is, starting from the identification of company’s values to interaction with different TAs at each level of brand development.
I am ready and able to learn fast as well as share my ideas and experience.
Analyzed project demands and hired a team to fully cover them.
Created a full employee life-cycle for supply agents, which included hiring, onboarding, adaptation, development, and off-boarding.
Made significant improvements to an existing quality assessment system that could efficiently evaluate the performance of each member of the team and the team as a whole.
Set up relevant OKRs that corresponded to the current stage of project development, thus giving the team an understanding of what to focus on to get the maximum profit.
Connected CS Team and Business Team so that the company's tone of voice could truly represent the company's values and policies.
I enjoy managing teams and helping to set the processes that would benefit both team and business. I am interested in a position, where besides working with the CS team, I can also apply and develop my skills in process optimization, team management & development, product improvement, and brand development.
Would like to join a company with transparent & ecological internal policies and growth opportunities where I can both apply and improve my experience and skills."
customer support,"У мене є досвід роботи в customer support, де я допомагала клієнтам вирішувати їхні проблеми та надавала консультації щодо продуктів і послуг. Це дозволило мені розвинути чудові комунікативні навички, здатність слухати й аналізувати потреби людей, а також знаходити ефективні рішення для кожної ситуації.
Проекти та задачі:
Я працювала над підтримкою клієнтів через різні канали зв'язку — чат, телефон, електронну пошту. Моя роль полягала в тому, щоб зрозуміти потреби клієнта, вирішити їхні питання та створити позитивний досвід.
Паралельно я працювала з внутрішніми базами даних, фіксувала запити та стежила за їхнім вирішенням. Це допомогло мені розвивати навички організації та роботи з інформацією.
Моя роль у команді:
На даний момент я відповідаю за взаємодію з клієнтами, вирішення проблем і підтримку на всіх етапах співпраці з ними. У команді я також допомагаю новим співробітникам адаптуватися, ділюсь досвідом та допомагаю покращувати робочі процеси.
Куди бажаю розвиватися:
Я хочу розвиватися в напрямку рекрутингу та HR. Мені подобається працювати з людьми, розуміти їхні потреби та допомагати їм знайти правильну можливість. Я готова вчитися новим інструментам, процесам і стратегіям, які дозволять мені ефективно залучати та підтримувати таланти в команді.
Розвиток комунікативних навичок: Регулярно отримую позитивні відгуки від клієнтів і керівництва за мою здатність слухати, співчувати і ефективно вирішувати проблеми, що дозволяє мені будувати довгострокові та позитивні стосунки з клієнтами.
Очікування від роботи:
Стабільність і розвиток: Я шукаю роботу, яка дозволить мені стабільно розвиватися в професійному плані, здобувати нові навички та досвід. Мені важливо працювати в компанії, яка підтримує постійне навчання та кар'єрне зростання.
Чітка комунікація і структура: Я очікую від роботодавця відкритості та чіткої комунікації на всіх етапах робочого процесу. Це допоможе уникати непорозумінь і працювати більш ефективно.
Гнучкий графік або віддалена робота: Оскільки я ціную баланс між роботою та особистим життям, для мене важливий гнучкий графік або можливість працювати віддалено.
Підтримка і зворотний зв'язок: Я сподіваюся отримувати регулярний зворотний зв'язок від керівництва, що допоможе мені вдосконалювати свої навички та краще виконувати свої обов'язки.
Чого я не хочу:
Невизначеність та хаос: Я не хочу працювати в умовах, де немає чіткої стратегії, планування або де постійно змінюються умови без попередження.
Постійні надмірні навантаження: Я готова працювати відповідально і на результат, але не хочу потрапити в ситуацію, де робота займає все моє життя, а баланс між роботою та відпочинком порушується.
Неуважне ставлення до співробітників: Мені важливо, щоб в компанії цінували кожного співробітника, його вклад і старання, а не просто вимагали результат без підтримки та зворотного зв'язку."

customer support,"Projects and Tasks Completed
Community Development and Support:
Developed and managed communities for SUI and The Sandbox, where I created educational content, hosted AMAs, and provided daily support for users on Discord, Telegram, and X (Twitter).
Led a specialized VIP support initiative for a crypto casino, where I managed high-level players, ensuring they received priority assistance and solutions tailored to their specific needs.
User Support and Troubleshooting:
Provided support through live chat, Email, and other communication channels, focusing on technical issues such as wallet connections, blockchain transaction confirmations, and crypto payments.
Analyzed and escalated complex technical issues to senior teams, contributing to platform improvements and user satisfaction.
Educational Content Creation:
Produced tutorials and guides to help users navigate the platforms, understand blockchain mechanics, and manage transactions. This content has enhanced user engagement and helped build an informed community.
Technologies Used
Blockchain Protocols: Familiar with SUI and Ethereum, as well as cryptocurrency transaction processes.
Communication Platforms: Proficient in Discord, Telegram, and Twitter, with advanced knowledge of community engagement tools within these platforms.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Experienced in using CRM systems to track and manage support tickets, especially for VIP players.
Data Analysis: Used analytics tools to gauge community engagement and feedback, allowing us to improve user satisfaction and engagement strategies.
Current Role in the Team
I serve as a Community Manager and VIP Support Specialist, focusing on high-level players, content creation, and overall community health. I actively engage with users, especially VIPs, moderating discussions and supporting them with crypto-related challenges. My goal is to ensure our community feels valued, supported, and informed about platform updates and features.
Developed and implemented a targeted engagement strategy for SUI and The Sandbox, resulting in a 25% increase in user activity on Discord and Telegram over three months. My initiatives included regular AMAs, interactive content, and onboarding sessions, which helped create a more active and informed community.
Enhanced VIP Experience in Crypto Casino:
Spearheaded a VIP support initiative that tailored assistance to high-value users, providing one-on-one support, personalized updates, and exclusive offers. This approach led to a 40% increase in VIP user retention and improved feedback from high-profile players. I created a streamlined escalation process, ensuring VIP players received prompt solutions to complex issues, enhancing their experience and loyalty.
Optimized User Support Process:
Reduced the average response time for user inquiries by 30% through the creation of a robust knowledge base and FAQ for common crypto-related questions (e.g., wallet connections, transaction issues). This resource improved first-response accuracy and allowed users to troubleshoot minor issues independently, increasing satisfaction and reducing workload on support staff.
Created Educational Content with High Engagement:
Designed a series of tutorials and guides explaining blockchain mechanics, wallet setup, and transaction verification that received high engagement rates on our community platforms. This content not only educated users but also empowered them to solve common issues, resulting in a 20% drop in support tickets related to these topics.
Leveraged Feedback for Platform Improvements:
Regularly collected and analyzed user feedback, particularly from VIP players, and collaborated with the development team to implement several improvements based on this input. This included updates to the user interface and transaction processing times, which helped address pain points and enhance the overall user experience.
What I Want:
Opportunities for Professional Growth: I’m looking for a work environment that encourages continuous learning, particularly in blockchain technology and community-building strategies. I would like access to resources, training, or mentorship that can help me develop my technical skills and expand my expertise in crypto and web3 ecosystems.
Collaboration and Open Communication: I value a culture where team members can share ideas, discuss strategies, and openly communicate challenges. A collaborative atmosphere would allow me to contribute meaningfully and feel supported, especially when handling complex user issues or developing community initiatives.
Meaningful Work and Impact: My ideal role involves contributing to projects that have a clear impact on the community, particularly with VIP users. I want to feel that my work directly supports user satisfaction, helps improve the platform, and positively influences the community experience.
A Focus on Innovation: I’m excited to work in an environment that values creativity and new ideas, particularly around how we can improve user engagement, VIP support, and the platform’s capabilities. I’m eager to be part of a team that encourages experimentation and stays ahead of trends in crypto and blockchain.
What I Don’t Want:
Rigid, Micromanaged Environment: I prefer to work in a role that offers autonomy and trust in my abilities to manage and support the community. Overly rigid processes or constant micromanagement would limit my effectiveness and creativity, especially in handling community dynamics or VIP user needs.
Lack of Clear Direction or Goals: I thrive in structured environments where team goals are clearly defined and aligned with the broader company vision. A role with ambiguous or frequently changing priorities could make it difficult to maintain focus and ensure the best outcomes for the community.
Minimal Engagement or Innovation: I’m passionate about work that encourages interaction, growth, and forward-thinking. A workplace that lacks a drive for innovation or only maintains the status quo wouldn’t align with my goals of contributing to a dynamic and evolving industry."

customer support,"During my tenure across three ICT companies, I have spearheaded and contributed to numerous projects across diverse technological domains. As the Head of the ICT team, ICT Specialist, and Customer Support Specialist, I focused on enhancing operational efficiency and driving innovation through the strategic implementation of cutting-edge tools and methodologies.
One of my key achievements was transforming project management processes by introducing agile methodologies. Using platforms like Jira and Trello, I optimized task allocation, progress tracking, and team collaboration, leading to faster project delivery and better resource management.
On the technical front, I led initiatives leveraging Python for automation and data analysis, and utilized PowerShell to automate routine system administration tasks. This increased productivity and reduced manual errors. Recognizing the potential of robotic process automation (RPA), I championed its adoption across departments, using tools like Power Automate to automate repetitive workflows. This shift enabled teams to focus on more valuable tasks, resulting in significant cost savings and operational efficiency.
As a leader, I emphasized continuous learning and development, encouraging my team to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends. This commitment to innovation has ensured our solutions remain at the cutting edge of technological advancement.
Looking ahead, I aim to further explore emerging technologies to drive digital transformation initiatives. My goal is to continue leveraging my expertise in project management, automation, and ICT solutions to support organizational growth and success in the dynamic ICT landscape.
