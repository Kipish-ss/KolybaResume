OsmAnd application was losing users and getting 1-star reviews on Google Play because of the political conflict. The OpenStreet Maps that the app was using had some areas considered Armenian.
Since the map is open for adjustments from the users, I have created a step-by-step tutorial on how to suggest adjustments to the map service and created posts on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit.
This led to more users purchasing the chargeable version of the app in a couple of days since lots of free users never knew they could improve the service.

Atom | online | July 2021 - November 2023
- Provided customer support at all stages of interaction with the product.
- Solved difficult situations with clients, provided individual solutions and support.
- Worked with the CRM system, helping to optimize customer processes.
- Prepared quick solutions to technical and communication issues that affected customer retention.
I have deep experience in building client services in the field of personal brand promotion and launching information products. During my work, I created 5 full-fledged customer services from scratch, covering all key stages of interaction with students - from the first contact to graduation.
I was in charge of more than 25 employees, for whom I personally developed areas of responsibility, set tasks, built a team structure, conducted training and adaptation. All stages of recruitment - from interviews to onboarding - were also entirely my responsibility.
Thanks to the implemented approaches and focus on service quality, the level of customer satisfaction reached 4.9 out of 5. This was possible not only due to a strong team, but also due to database automation, which I implemented through systems based on various tables, which made it possible to increase efficiency and transparency.
In addition to the service side, I have experience in improving the product line - through close customer feedback, pain and expectation analysis, I initiated and implemented changes that positively impacted customer conversion, retention, and bottom line.
My main achievement is the systematic construction of services from scratch that not only withstood high loads, but also ensured customer engagement and positive results."

Consulting on any questions about the company's product, processing simple requests and complaints, ensuring prompt resolution of the problem and improving the user experience.
----------------
Cooperated with almost all internal departments of the companies in Slack to develop more complex keys, as well as other direct tasks from other departments. Trained new employees and shared experience in customer service (mentoring). Conducting basic verification of customer profiles, checking unsuccessful transactions using special tools.
Starting from the first full month, I consistently held the highest positions in the team according to KPI. I quickly found a common language with colleagues, at any levels/positions, both in my team and in other departments.
Also, during all my time in the company, I had no ""punctures"" regarding labor discipline, as well as no conflict situations with colleagues.

From my first job, I expect the opportunity to start my journey in IT, actively learn and grow. It is important for me to work in a strong and supportive team that will push me to develop quickly and help me achieve both personal and team goals.
I also want to have a great mentor who will guide me through processes, share valuable experience and support my professional growth.

customer support,"Hello,
My name is Levan, and I would like to tell you about my background.
I am currently a student at Georgian Technical University, as well as a dedicated sportsman and fitness enthusiast. I am excited to share my past experiences with you.
My first role was as a car import specialist. I was responsible for purchasing vehicles at auctions, supervising their shipment, coordinating with mechanics to ensure quality repairs at affordable prices, and selling the cars at a profit. This experience enhanced my organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to deliver results under pressure.
I later joined Borusan CAT as a CVA Specialist. My tasks included coordinating maintenance schedules, booking mechanics, optimizing routes, and ensuring the availability of tools and parts. This role improved my planning, communication, and problem-solving abilities.
After that, I worked at AutoMarket Logistics as a sales manager. I helped clients select vehicles that suited their needs, designed payment plans, and assisted them in making their final decisions. This position helped me further develop my sales, negotiation, and client relationship skills.
I took a brief break from work to prepare for an amateur international kickboxing championship, which I am proud to say I won. This achievement reflects my discipline, perseverance, and ability to balance multiple commitments.
After my success in kickboxing, I began working at iSpeedToLead as a Customer Support Agent. My responsibilities included communicating with clients, assisting them with individual issues, processing refunds, and providing information about company policies. This role enhanced my ability to be helpful and adaptable in various customer interactions.
I also volunteer as a coach at my kickboxing gym, where I help newcomers develop their skills and train them. This experience has helped me strengthen my communication and mentoring skills, as I work with individuals at different skill levels to support their growth and success in the sports.
What I learned from my previous roles and experiences has shown me that anything I try to achieve is possible. My work ethic and ability to develop new skills are among my best qualities. Additionally, my achievements in sports demonstrate my resolve and discipline.
What I want from work is a flexible schedule and a positive, friendly environment. Additionally, I value opportunities for growth and development. I’m not looking for a job that only provides a paycheck. I want a role that offers meaningful experiences and the chance to improve myself professionally."

I'm writing to express my interest in working for your company as a customer support representative and a sales specialist. For more than six years, I worked as a call center representative, making sales calls to clients in order to close deals or, at the very least, pique their interest in what the company had to offer. During this time, I learned to accept rejection gently and to persevere in the face of angry clients and verbal abuse by smiling. I learned to set aside my emotions and concentrate on the task at hand.
When a previous customer wants to cancel their account, I have the skills and experience to devise strategies to persuade them to continue using your services. I have the ability to attempt Use this information to rectify the situation, as well as the patience to patiently listen to the customer's explanations for why they are no longer interested in my services.
If a customer is dissatisfied with the service, I can find out why and look for solutions. Then, if permitted by your company, I can persuade the customer to try again by offering a discount or other services they can try out for free for a limited time. I am confident that I possess the skills and experience that your company seeks in a candidate, and I eagerly await our next meeting."

After joining the project, I changed the processes by organizing daily calls for the team, during which we analyzed cases and learned something new related to the product daily. As I got to know the product, I quickly managed to prepare a product documentation based on which I created a technical documentation for the support team and for onboarding newcomers, which I fully designed, wrote and managed myself in Confluence. I also recorded 15 lectures on the product which can be accessible by new employees to quickly dive into understanding the product. I pushed the idea among the management that each support team member needs their own sandbox to test the company's product to better understand customers' problems, which was also implemented. I actively analyzed problems in the processes between different departments and the functioning of products and their flows and presented it to the management, which in general significantly improved the interaction and communication between the support and development teams and clients.
