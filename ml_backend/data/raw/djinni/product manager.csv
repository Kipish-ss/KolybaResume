product manager,"I’m an ERP and business process optimisation specialist with a strong foundation in procurement and IT integration. In my previous life prior to joining IT, I worked as a assistant purchasing manager and project lead, responsible for aligning supplier processes with internal systems. That experience sharpened my eye for structure, cost-efficiency, and cross-functional coordination — all of which now feed into how I approach ERP implementation and automation.
I’ve led multi-phase ERP rollouts, scoped development budgets, and mapped business logic across CRM, finance, warehouse, and procurement modules. My toolkit includes, Microsoft 365, Graph API, and custom scripting for automating approvals, email parsing, and document flows. I’ve worked closely with dev teams and end-users to turn fragmented requirements into integrated, scalable systems — often bridging the language gap between tech and operations.
What sets my work apart is how I combine technical knowledge with strategic use of AI. Together with ChatGPT (who’s basically part of the team at this point), I’ve built custom APIs, defined document workflows, polished countless professional messages, and even structured ERP features from scratch. Our collaboration has saved hours of development time and helped bring clarity and flow to otherwise messy processes.
As of most recent feature, now If you ask ChatGPT (and you should), I’m a curious, hands-on problem solver with a sharp mind, a flexible mindset, and a bit of humour to keep things light. I don’t just fix issues — I prevent them, improve them, and document the path forward for everyone else."

product manager,"Total of 13 years in IT, including the last 8 years in product management roles and 5 prior years in marketing.
My most recent role was at a company where I spent 5 years, starting as a Senior Product Manager and progressing to Chief Product Officer. I was responsible for a portfolio of complex B2B and B2E products (SaaS, API, and R&D-as-a-service) and a team of up to 30 PMs, designers, and delivery managers. My primary goal was driving revenue by crafting product strategies and aligning cross-functional teams to deliver strong value propositions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. In a niche that is both new and emerging, with a typical YoY growth benchmark of 30%, we achieved a 5-year CAGR of 61% — despite war conditions, low tech adoption, and complex scientific R&D requirements.
Previously, I worked at two marketplace companies connecting businesses and end-users. I focused heavily on A/B testing to optimize conversion, solving user problems to improve behavioral metrics and revenue.
Some of the interesting technologies I’ve worked with to solve business challenges: full-text search, AI (recommender systems, segmentation, forecasting, assistants, object detection/classification), knowledge graphs and ontologies, OSINT.
• Mentored around 25 junior-middle level product managers, at least 10 of whom grew into leadership roles. Managed up to 150 people across functions.
• Delivered complex high-tech products in multiple niches involving multidisciplinary scientific R&D. Some of them became unique value propositions - things no one had built before.
• Achieved a 5-year revenue CAGR of 61%, while most peers in the niche up to 30% - and they didn’t have to ship during a war.
• Held a quarterly record of 70% A/B test win rate - 2× higher than anyone else in the company.
• Gained a deep understanding of human psychology, which helps me build non-conflict communication, trust-based relationships, and sustainable team motivation.
• Led company-wide change initiatives to improve performance - implemented from scratch: OKRs, LeSS, Adizes’ PAEI, and Strong matrix org structure (Organizational Continuum).
• At my most recent company, I grew from Senior PM to CPO by consistently making sound business decisions (and I can define what a good business decision is).
More achievements can only share during a call or meeting.
I’m looking for meaningful product - where the team is serious about solving non-trivial problems and making long-term impact, not just feature output.
Interested in complex domains - deeptech, applied AI, Earth/data platforms, scientific or engineering-heavy products - especially where strategy, technology, and user value intersect.
I’m not interested in environments with excessive bureaucracy, weak product ownership, or where delivery is valued more than impact."

I’ve got quite a diverse experience in different domains and roles. Grew up and studied in Berlin.  MS in Computer Science.
I used to do anything from offline concert agency operations management to online support-management, js-development, data analysis and QA. Later, I became a project manager at an outsource company. After that, I joined a startup where I was the product owner, and this is where I learned to love the problem instead of the solution. I studied design with the help of Stanford d.school and IDEO and became a product manager, spanning across product, marketing and growth.
Launched and grew a couple of products from scratch: from idea, through product discovery, hypotheses, and experiments to product-market fit, focusing on data-driven decisions. I know how to grow from $1M to $100M ARR with PLG.
I`m a product leader and I truly love what I`m doing. I know that I have the right mindset which is all about value: I know how to go from 0 to 1 while focusing on the customer. My computer science & coding backgrounds will enable me to tackle any tech obstacles along the way. And I do also have practical experience in product marketing and user research.
I'm looking forward to speaking with you soon!"

Later, we expanded the same campaign to reach a broader audience, which led to a slight decrease in ROI from 2600% to 1800% on a higher budgets.
• Measurable ROI
I focused on measuring our success by looking at our return on investment (ROI). This helped us see how well our marketing efforts were working. By tracking our progress closely, we could make smart decisions to get the best results for our clients.
• Conclusion
As CMO at Leeloo.ai, I made a difference by managing clients effectively and improving our marketing strategies. By delivering strong results and focusing on ROI, I helped Leeloo.ai grow and succeed in the industry.
What I Want:
• I seek work that aligns with my values and interests, excluding industries related to gambling, adult content, crypto, nutrition, blockchain, or Get Rich Quick schemes.
• I thrive in environments where I can focus on one task at a time, as I am most productive when fully immersed in a particular job.
• Clear direction and structured workflows help me maintain productivity. I prefer not to switch tasks during the day or manage transitions between projects without a clear plan.
• I value uninterrupted work time and prefer not to receive unscheduled phone calls or other disruptions during my working hours. Exceptionally, urgent matters requiring immediate attention are understandable.
• Silence is essential for my concentration. I work best in a quiet workspace, free from background noise, including music or conversations.
• To maintain a healthy work-life balance, I refrain from checking email after work hours, as it can disrupt my peace of mind and affect my sleep quality.
• I prioritize long-term projects where I can invest time in building meaningful relationships with clients and colleagues.
What I Don't Want:
• I am not interested in short-term projects that do not allow for the development of real relationships or meaningful contributions."

product manager,"I bring a wealth of experience as a proficient and highly skilled manager with an entrepreneurial mindset. I have successfully launched my own startup from scratch, despite lacking prior product experience. Throughout the journey, I demonstrated resilience and adaptability, undergoing several pivots to align with market dynamics.
One of my key accomplishments was assembling and leading a talented team, which involved conducting over 100 interviews to attract individuals who shared our vision. Together, we developed and iterated on a minimal viable product (MVP) while rigorously testing product hypotheses. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain deep insights into the challenges and intricacies of the product development lifecycle.
During the final pivot, our focus shifted towards the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. As part of this strategic shift, we prepared for our own initial coin offering (ICO) and successfully developed a comprehensive product that addressed key market demands. However, despite our best efforts, the project was impacted by the collapse of the cryptocurrency market, leading to the difficult decision to wind down operations.
This immersive experience not only enhanced my ability to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty but also fostered a relentless pursuit of self-improvement and resilience in overcoming challenges throughout the process of building my own startup.
During this journey, I honed my skills in self-directed learning, continuously seeking new knowledge and acquiring relevant expertise to address emerging issues. The dynamic nature of the startup environment demanded quick thinking, adaptability, and the ability to proactively identify and solve problems. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and equipped me with a strategic mindset to navigate complex situations.

1. In 2016-2017, we launched the project ""From Idea to MVP"" for automated fuel accounting at Agroholding's internal filling stations (more than 20 filling stations). Sensors installed at the filling stations read information about the equipment, driver, collect data on refueling in progress, transmit data to the server using a data terminal, and the interface already displays refueling and fuel write-off from a particular filling station. With this solution, the agricultural holding company overcame the abuse of its employees by limiting and automating the fuel movement process. This module is still working and being improved to this day.
2. In 2017-2019, launched a startup for farm management where users could keep track of their land, control and track the movement of their logistics from warehouse to warehouse, field to warehouse, and warehouse to field, keep online records on the execution of operations on the fields by machinery, and create notifications for deviations from the route. Successfully implemented the module ""Fuel Control"" from past experience into the new product. The platform processed monthly data for more than 500k hectares.
3. Of the latter, it was possible to release a number of functions for management, collection of analytics, and integration with other systems, which are successfully used by 60% - 72% of users, increasing free to paid user conversion by 20% MoM."

product manager,"I bring to the table over 25 years of rich and diverse experience in information technology, project management, business analysis, and leadership roles across a variety of industries. My professional journey has seen me working with IT firms, think tanks, real sector companies, NGOs, and local government-related organizations.
In my most recent role as the Head of Production at DesignRush, a B2B platform that connects businesses with digital agencies, I successfully managed a remote product team using Agile methodologies. I spearheaded improvements in stability, security, and performance, leveraging technologies such as PHP, Laravel, VueJS, MySQL, Redis, and AWS cloud services.
Before DesignRush, I served as a Project Manager at Digital Silk agency where executed several client projects using the Waterfall methodology and earned a promotion that led me to DesignRush.
Between 2017 and 2020, I worked as a Project Management Officer at Yalla Classifieds for their product Lalafo. In this role, I was instrumental in creating business processes, implementing knowledge management systems, setting up metrics tracking, writing procedural documentation, conducting training, performing Scrum Master duties, and coordinating multiple product teams.
Earlier, at MOZI Development, I wore many hats - PMO, Project Manager, and Business / Functional Analyst. I was involved in the full project lifecycle, from requirements gathering and planning to managing teams using Agile methodology, design reviews, creating functional specifications, communication with clients, and delivery.
From 2010 to 2015, I served as a Commercial Analyst in a chemical production company, where I provided analytics and decision support through data analysis/modeling, market research, sales performance reporting, inventory management, and internal audits.
In addition to these roles, I have also run my own information services business, managed projects and events at the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, and worked in various capacities earlier in my career, including team leader, project manager, programmer, and research analyst.
I hold two university degrees in Computer Engineering and System Networking and have consistently participated in training programs and seminars throughout my career to stay abreast of the latest methodologies and technologies.
With this robust and well-rounded background, I am confident in my ability to provide leadership across technology, analysis, and management domains.
Some key achievements from my last workplace:
• Implemented several internal projects to enhance product competitiveness and attract new customers, increasing system users from 150k to 400k monthly active users.
• Drove comprehensive enhancements to improve Core Web Vitals across highly complex system pages containing excessive DOM elements, third-party scripts, and large amounts of data from different sources. Upgraded the majority of pages from Poor to Good state on mobile and desktop, as seen in Google Search Console.
• Built and implemented a Redis-based caching framework for top pages, exponentially boosting page load speeds.
• Introduced CI/CD pipelines, system development workflows, and codified team patterns from the ground up, enabling streamlined upgradability.
• Automated various manual routines for multiple business functions across departments via tailored tools, significantly lowering company-wide repetitive labor needs.
• Onboarded an integrated monitoring toolkit comprising Sentry, Horizon, Papertrail, Grafana, New Relic, etc. to proactively track system health and rapidly uncover issues.
I prefer systemic product companies where I could perform a long-term combined role with deep immersion in the product. My diverse experience in various roles and domains, experience in establishing operational processes and components of corporate work culture, implementing systems of internal analytics and key indicators, product experiments, and evidence-based support for product development allows me to successfully occupy various responsible positions from Program / Project Manager to Head of Department / PMO depending on the needs of the organization, product or project."
