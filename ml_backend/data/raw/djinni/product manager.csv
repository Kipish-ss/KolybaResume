I’ve owned products end-to-end: from market discovery and opportunity analysis to execution, go-to-market, and optimization.
I’ve led the delivery of complex system integrations, worked closely with partners and external vendors on API design, data flows, and automation logic, and helped align cross-functional stakeholders around clear product vision and commercial impact.
My background includes both enterprise and consumer-facing products, with strong consulting experience — translating business needs into scalable tech architecture and efficient delivery pipelines.
Across all roles, I’ve consistently launched high-impact, outcome-driven features and platforms — guided by strategy, user empathy, and a deep understanding of business context.

1. In 2016-2017, we launched the project ""From Idea to MVP"" for automated fuel accounting at Agroholding's internal filling stations (more than 20 filling stations). Sensors installed at the filling stations read information about the equipment, driver, collect data on refueling in progress, transmit data to the server using a data terminal, and the interface already displays refueling and fuel write-off from a particular filling station. With this solution, the agricultural holding company overcame the abuse of its employees by limiting and automating the fuel movement process. This module is still working and being improved to this day.
2. In 2017-2019, launched a startup for farm management where users could keep track of their land, control and track the movement of their logistics from warehouse to warehouse, field to warehouse, and warehouse to field, keep online records on the execution of operations on the fields by machinery, and create notifications for deviations from the route. Successfully implemented the module ""Fuel Control"" from past experience into the new product. The platform processed monthly data for more than 500k hectares.
3. Of the latter, it was possible to release a number of functions for management, collection of analytics, and integration with other systems, which are successfully used by 60% - 72% of users, increasing free to paid user conversion by 20% MoM."

I'm always eager to learn and grow. Feel free to reach out and connect with me on LinkedIn!
My greatest professional achievement was earning a first-class Bachelor of Engineering degree within four years, despite limited financial support from my family. I worked part-time throughout my studies to fund my education, which taught me to prioritize my time, develop disciplined habits, and stay focused on long-term goals. This experience instilled a resilience and resourcefulness that I’m confident will empower my contributions and growth in the MBA program and beyond.
From work, I want an environment that fosters growth, values innovation, and encourages collaboration across teams. I seek challenging projects where I can apply my skills in product management, develop new expertise, and contribute meaningfully to the company's success. A workplace that prioritizes learning, provides opportunities for professional development, and offers the flexibility to explore creative solutions aligns with my aspirations. Working with driven, skilled individuals and having a clear vision for career progression are also key for me.
On the other hand, I prefer to avoid rigid, overly hierarchical structures that limit flexibility and creative problem-solving. Environments that lack clear goals, openness to new ideas, or effective communication can be counterproductive, so I look for companies that value transparency and teamwork. Finally, I'm not interested in roles where there’s little scope for growth or where innovation is secondary to routine tasks."

I also identified 4 new product hypotheses as a result of 34 in-depth user interviews, conducted a large-scale competitor research (60+ references and cases), and participated in the work on 20+ prototypes for the web and mobile versions of the platform. I led a team of 5 people and managed the full cycle of feature implementation. In 5 months, my cross-functional team and I prepared a full version of the platform with 6 sections, a recommendation system, and a user profile page.
My previous, no less interesting experience was preparing product presentations for startups and large and well-known companies. My area of responsibility included communicating directly with the client: during the 100+ conversations I had, I tried to ask the right questions about the product and business to find out as much information as possible about the pains and needs of the target audience, as well as the benefits of the client's product. The second stage was working on a prototype presentation. This work included conveying the meanings and benefits of the product, forming a coherent structure and logic of the presentation, and preparing the Text.
I also have experience in launching my own project - an online clothing store. While working on it, I gained my first extensive experience in finding and testing hypotheses (I tested 4 big hypotheses), managing a team of 3 people, working on marketing and analytics, conducting detailed research on competitors, and finding real opportunities for future development.
1) Working on the platform with a cross-functional team of 5 people, reached the 6000 website views per month and 1700 MAU mark with limited marketing and development resources.
2) Identified 4 product hypotheses as a result of 34 in-depth user interviews, which helped to adjust the direction of the platform's development.
3) Analyzed 60+ references as part of competitor research, which helped prepare the first prototypes and functionality for creating video and article sections on the platform.
4) Prepared 80+ prototypes of product presentations for various companies based on an in-depth analysis of the target audience, product benefits, and interviews with company owners.
5) While working on my own online store, I tested 4 product hypotheses. One of them led to a surge in sales: 72% MoM revenue growth.
6) In 4 months with a team of 3 people, I launched the first version of my own store, built processes, started sales, and collecting feedback from customers.
7) While developing the store, I reduced the initial cost of goods by 26% after analyzing 14 suppliers.
I want to continue my career as a product manager with an ambitious team in a company with a strong product culture. I would be happy to join a large company or startup in its early stages."

Застосовував аналітичні моделі для прогнозування поведінки системи за умов змінного навантаження та сценаріїв використання, що підтримувало стратегічне планування та прийняття рішень.
Поєднував технічну експертизу з бізнес-аналізом для створення гнучкої архітектури, узгодженої з цілями проєкту та вимогами ринку.
Заснував і масштабував платформу аналітики на базі ШІ (ELOGY) — від ідеї до робочого MVP з розпізнавання логотипів у реальному часі, аудіоаналізом та розрахунком медіа-цінності у стрімах та кіберспортивних трансляціях.
Успішно керував мультидисциплінарними командами (15+ спеціалістів) у сферах продакт-менеджменту, розробки, аналітики та маркетингу для складних цифрових продуктів.
Розробив унікальну модель розрахунку медіа-цінності для рекламодавців на Twitch та YouTube, що поєднує в собі видимість логотипів, кількість глядачів, згадки в аудіо та активність у чаті.
Запустив та підтримував B2B-інтеграції з Twitch API, OBS, Discord Bot та платформами аналітики, забезпечуючи повний цикл трекінгу рекламних кампаній та автоматизовану звітність.

product manager,"I’m an ERP and business process optimisation specialist with a strong foundation in procurement and IT integration. In my previous life prior to joining IT, I worked as a assistant purchasing manager and project lead, responsible for aligning supplier processes with internal systems. That experience sharpened my eye for structure, cost-efficiency, and cross-functional coordination — all of which now feed into how I approach ERP implementation and automation.
I’ve led multi-phase ERP rollouts, scoped development budgets, and mapped business logic across CRM, finance, warehouse, and procurement modules. My toolkit includes, Microsoft 365, Graph API, and custom scripting for automating approvals, Email parsing, and document flows. I’ve worked closely with dev teams and end-users to turn fragmented requirements into integrated, scalable systems — often bridging the language gap between tech and operations.
What sets my work apart is how I combine technical knowledge with strategic use of AI. Together with ChatGPT (who’s basically part of the team at this point), I’ve built custom APIs, defined document workflows, polished countless professional messages, and even structured ERP features from scratch. Our collaboration has saved hours of development time and helped bring clarity and flow to otherwise messy processes.
As of most recent feature, now If you ask ChatGPT (and you should), I’m a curious, hands-on problem solver with a sharp mind, a flexible mindset, and a bit of humour to keep things light. I don’t just fix issues — I prevent them, improve them, and document the path forward for everyone else."

product manager,"Total of 13 years in IT, including the last 8 years in product management roles and 5 prior years in e-commerce marketing.
My most recent role was at a company where I spent 5 years, starting as a Senior Product Manager and progressing to Chief Product Officer. I was responsible for a portfolio of complex B2B and B2E products (SaaS, API, and R&D-as-a-service) and a team of up to 30 people (PMs, designers, and delivery managers). My primary goal was achieving revenue goals by crafting product strategies and aligning cross-functional teams to deliver strong value propositions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. In a niche that is both new and emerging, with a typical YoY growth benchmark of 30%, we achieved a 5-year CAGR of 61% - despite war conditions, low tech adoption, and complex scientific R&D requirements.
Previously, I worked at two marketplace companies connecting businesses and end-users. I focused heavily on A/B testing to optimize conversion, solving user problems to improve behavioral metrics and revenue.
Some of the interesting technologies I’ve worked with to solve business challenges: full-Text search, AI (recommender systems, segmentation, forecasting, assistants, object detection/classification), knowledge graphs and ontologies, OSINT.
• Mentored around 25 junior-middle level product managers, at least 10 of whom grew into leadership roles. Managed up to 150 people across functions.
• Delivered complex high-tech products in multiple niches involving multidisciplinary scientific R&D. Some became unique value propositions - things no one had built before.
• Achieved a 5-year revenue CAGR of 61%, while most peers in the niche up to 30% - and they didn’t have to ship during a war.
• Held a quarterly record of 70% A/B test win rate (with a goal of revenue growth) - 2× higher than anyone else in the company.
• Led company wide change initiatives to improve overall performance - initiated and implemented from scratch: OKRs, LeSS, Adizes’ PAEI, and Strong matrix org structure (Organizational Continuum).
• At my most recent company, I grew from Senior PM to CPO by consistently making good business decisions (and I can define what a good business decision is).
• Gained a deep understanding of human psychology, which helps me build non-conflict communication, trust-based relationships, and sustainable team motivation.
More achievements can be shared during a call or meeting in Kyiv.
Looking for meaningful product solving non-trivial problems and making long-term impact.
Interested in complex domains like deeptech, applied AI, Earth/data platforms, scientific or engineering-heavy products.

My teams at any time have clear vision on what we’re building, how, why and what customer needs will be addressed
Having spent over 16 years in product management, I’ve had the honour to manage starting from small projects up to building whole business verticals in alignment and benefiting towards the company's mission, vision and strategy. I have succeeded either delivering in-house developed solutions, managing outsourced teams or integrating third-party solutions, systems and services
Although my deepest expertise lies in the financial transactions processing, I’m either profound in web / mobile applications, customer-facing features and always looking to provide a coherent and convenient user experience for customers. I believe that keys to product’s success are, in the first place, simplicity, reliability and ease of use

product manager,"I bring a wealth of experience as a proficient and highly skilled manager with an entrepreneurial mindset. I have successfully launched my own startup from scratch, despite lacking prior product experience. Throughout the journey, I demonstrated resilience and adaptability, undergoing several pivots to align with market dynamics.
One of my key accomplishments was assembling and leading a talented team, which involved conducting over 100 interviews to attract individuals who shared our vision. Together, we developed and iterated on a minimal viable product (MVP) while rigorously testing product hypotheses. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain deep insights into the challenges and intricacies of the product development lifecycle.
During the final pivot, our focus shifted towards the cryptocurrency and blockchain market. As part of this strategic shift, we prepared for our own initial coin offering (ICO) and successfully developed a comprehensive product that addressed key market demands. However, despite our best efforts, the project was impacted by the collapse of the cryptocurrency market, leading to the difficult decision to wind down operations.
This immersive experience not only enhanced my ability to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty but also fostered a relentless pursuit of self-improvement and resilience in overcoming challenges throughout the process of building my own startup.
During this journey, I honed my skills in self-directed learning, continuously seeking new knowledge and acquiring relevant expertise to address emerging issues. The dynamic nature of the startup environment demanded quick thinking, adaptability, and the ability to proactively identify and solve problems. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills and equipped me with a strategic mindset to navigate complex situations.

product manager,"I bring to the table over 25 years of rich and diverse experience in information technology, project management, business analysis, and leadership roles across a variety of industries. My professional journey has seen me working with IT firms, think tanks, real sector companies, NGOs, and local government-related organizations.
In my most recent role as the Head of Production at DesignRush, a B2B platform that connects businesses with digital agencies, I successfully managed a remote product team using Agile methodologies. I spearheaded improvements in stability, security, and performance, leveraging technologies such as PHP, Laravel, VueJS, MySQL, Redis, and AWS cloud services.
Before DesignRush, I served as a Project Manager at Digital Silk agency where executed several client projects using the Waterfall methodology and earned a promotion that led me to DesignRush.
Between 2017 and 2020, I worked as a Project Management Officer at Yalla Classifieds for their product Lalafo. In this role, I was instrumental in creating business processes, implementing knowledge management systems, setting up metrics tracking, writing procedural documentation, conducting training, performing Scrum Master duties, and coordinating multiple product teams.
Earlier, at MOZI Development, I wore many hats - PMO, Project Manager, and Business / Functional Analyst. I was involved in the full project lifecycle, from requirements gathering and planning to managing teams using Agile methodology, design reviews, creating functional specifications, communication with clients, and delivery.
From 2010 to 2015, I served as a Commercial Analyst in a chemical production company, where I provided analytics and decision support through data analysis/modeling, market research, sales performance reporting, inventory management, and internal audits.
In addition to these roles, I have also run my own information services business, managed projects and events at the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, and worked in various capacities earlier in my career, including team leader, project manager, programmer, and research analyst.
I hold two university degrees in Computer Engineering and System Networking and have consistently participated in training programs and seminars throughout my career to stay abreast of the latest methodologies and technologies.
With this robust and well-rounded background, I am confident in my ability to provide leadership across technology, analysis, and management domains.
Some key achievements from my last workplace:
• Implemented several internal projects to enhance product competitiveness and attract new customers, increasing system users from 150k to 400k monthly active users.
• Drove comprehensive enhancements to improve Core Web Vitals across highly complex system pages containing excessive DOM elements, third-party scripts, and large amounts of data from different sources. Upgraded the majority of pages from Poor to Good state on mobile and desktop, as seen in Google Search Console.
• Built and implemented a Redis-based caching framework for top pages, exponentially boosting page load speeds.
• Introduced CI/CD pipelines, system development workflows, and codified team patterns from the ground up, enabling streamlined upgradability.
• Automated various manual routines for multiple business functions across departments via tailored tools, significantly lowering company-wide repetitive labor needs.
• Onboarded an integrated monitoring toolkit comprising Sentry, Horizon, Papertrail, Grafana, New Relic, etc. to proactively track system health and rapidly uncover issues.
I prefer systemic product companies where I could perform a long-term combined role with deep immersion in the product. My diverse experience in various roles and domains, experience in establishing operational processes and components of corporate work culture, implementing systems of internal analytics and key indicators, product experiments, and evidence-based support for product development allows me to successfully occupy various responsible positions from Program / Project Manager to Head of Department / PMO depending on the needs of the organization, product or project."

- I worked with 3 large iGaming projects, which are represented in CIS, LATAM, African regions and Europe (1 project which worked in 2 countries).
- I customized from scratch the processes of working with clients at all stages of their life on the platform: from registration and activity, to inactivity and loss of the client as a result.
- I segmented customers into different categories and implemented a strategy for working with them. This in turn reduced the churn rate by 10% and increased the number of new clients with repeat deposits by 12-17%. It also helped to increase the effectiveness of customer engagement in our promotions by 20-25% and reduce bonus cost by 12-15%.
- As a result of customer segmentation, I built engagement points with customers based on their Category and behavior on the platform.
- Together with the CRM team I set up automated interaction with the client where possible: Email, sms, push notifications, etc....
- Together with the analytics team, metrics were set up to track key performance indicators of the department. This helped to reduce the time of analysis, calculation of indicators and reporting for management and other departments. This in turn allowed the time to be reallocated to other tasks.
- I revised bonus campaigns and began the process of implementing a new structure, which is focused on keeping clients in tone and desire to interact, rather than just regularly receive typical bonuses without any interaction. This in turn started to have a positive impact on the response of VIP clients.
- I created a sales / retention book, which fully described the processes of interaction with customers and other technical information.

product manager,"I have over three and a half years of experience in managing IT projects and five years in humanitarian projects.
Throughout my career, I have participated in a wide range of projects, including:
product support, migrations, new product launches, medical projects, game dev, marketing and affiliate projects,
as well as event organization worldwide.
I have successfully managed teams across different time zones and with diverse cultural backgrounds.
I have implemented Scrum and Kanban from scratch, instilling the values of these frameworks within the teams. Additionally, I have built business processes using Confluence and Jira, applying UML and BPMN methodologies.
In my current role, I coordinate and manage projects in marketing and game development, ensuring that goals are met and that team members collaborate effectively. I am committed to continuous improvement and professional growth, always developing my skills.
In the future, I aim to deepen my knowledge of new technologies and project management methodologies. Additionally, I am focused on enhancing my leadership and communication skills to lead teams and projects more effectively.
Here's an achievement example that I can share without violating NDA:
When I joined a team at one company, we faced a lack of clear processes both in team interactions and internally. I developed and implemented business processes, automated routine tasks, which led to a reduction in employee burnout rates (according to HR statistics). This helped relieve specialists from routine tasks and identified opportunities to take on several new projects and launch new products. Additionally, it allowed us to reduce hiring costs by improving automation efficiency.
Expectations:
I am looking for a role that offers opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth. Ideally, this position would involve challenging projects that push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge in project management and technology. I seek a collaborative and dynamic work environment where innovation and creativity are encouraged, and where I can contribute to meaningful projects that have a positive impact.
I value a company culture that prioritizes open communication, teamwork, and mutual respect. I want to work with a team that is passionate, driven, and supportive, where everyone's contributions are recognized and valued. Flexibility and a healthy work-life balance are also important to me, as they enable sustained productivity and job satisfaction.
What I Don't Want:
I do not want to be in a role where there is a lack of clear direction and support. Micromanagement and a rigid, overly hierarchical structure are also undesirable, as they can stifle creativity and innovation. Additionally, I prefer to avoid environments where there is poor communication, lack of collaboration, and insufficient recognition of individual and team achievements."

product manager,"I am passionate about Product Management and love building digital products that solve real user problems by combining design, development, and product mindset. I enjoy being involved in every phase of product development, delivering well-designed and user-friendly apps from initial concept to launch.
In January 2025 I finished the course Mobile Product Manager, where I acquired practical skills in market analysis, competitor research, defining product concepts and MVP features, formulating and prioritizing hypotheses, creating backlogs, roadmaps, modeling unit economics, and designing GTM strategies.
During the last years I:
• Designed, developed, and launched 3 mobile apps using SwiftUI, taking full ownership from concept and design to App Store release.
• Conducted competitive analysis to identify market gaps and developed truly unique selling propositions (USPs) that differentiated my apps from existing solutions.
• Leveraged TikTok and Instagram for organic user acquisition, creating engaging content that generated millions of views, hundreds of thousands of likes, and thousands of app installs.
I’m excited to grow in Product Management and ready to take on new challenges!
•  Apple Entrepreneur Camp Alumni: I was selected to participate in an immersive technology lab, receiving one-on-one code-level guidance from Apple experts and engineers, along with mentorship, inspiration, and insights from top Apple leaders.
• Received a top grade for the final project at Mobile Product Manager course.
• Awwwards: For 5 years I served as a Young Judge for Awwwards, reviewing and rating top web designs worldwide based on aesthetics, usability, and innovation."

product manager,"I’m a Product Manager with a background in building real businesses and digital products — often in resource-limited environments, where clarity, focus, and creativity made all the difference.
Over the years, I’ve led service design, product operations, and growth initiatives across different industries — from long-stay rentals to hospitality and B2B services. Much of my work involved transforming messy, offline processes into lean, scalable systems that deliver better experiences for both users and teams.
I’m especially strong at aligning people, simplifying complexity, and designing for outcomes. In recent years, I’ve been intentionally transitioning into more structured product environments — focusing on metrics, experimentation, and discovery as a core part of my practice.
• Built lean, scalable service systems from scratch — used by thousands of guests and staff across real-world operations.
• Transformed a fragmented long-stay rental workflow into a modular cleaning and logistics system — reducing operational cost per visit by ~30%.
• Designed a tiered pricing and service model based on user psychology and value perception — increasing upsell conversion by 20% in higher-tier properties.
• Ran discovery and onboarding experiments for a boutique stay format — validating customer demand and packaging.
• Introduced structured planning (OKRs) and agile rhythms for a distributed team — improving visibility, alignment, and speed.
• Designed and led product positioning for niche markets (e.g. “party-friendly premium stays”) — balancing strong UX with business goals.
I’m looking to join a team that cares about building meaningful, user-centered products — with a culture of ownership, iteration, and curiosity.
My long-term focus is product management, but I understand that strong teams are built step by step. I’m open to adjacent roles (e.g. Junior PM, Product Analyst, Project Manager) — as long as there’s room to grow, take responsibility, and work close to the problem.
What I’m not looking for: purely delivery-focused roles with no exposure to user needs, feedback, or product decision-making."

product manager,"Разработал 30+ проектов, запускал множество проектов и управлял командами. Моей основной задачей является работа с клиентом, анализ существующих процессов и конечное предложение автоматизации данных процессов. Помимо этого в опыте я реализовывал новое видение в части развития продукта. Ко мне приходят с идеей либо же с уже существующим продуктом, с целью увеличения доходности, создания эффективной модели работы с клиентом и командой, указания будущих вариантов развития продукта или же консультационные работы.
Из ярких проектов в которых мне приходилось участвовать могу отметить такие как:
* Работал над проектом по автоматизации процессов агропромышленного комплекса более 3 лет. Этот проект стал для меня профессиональным вызовом, требующим погружения в новую предметную область. Мне пришлось изучить множество терминов, разобраться в специфике агроиндустрии и найти решения, которые эффективно работают даже в сложных условиях.
Проект с бюджетом 1,5 млрд тенге стал уникальным благодаря нашей команде из 30 специалистов (аналитики, разработчики, тестировщики, дизайнеры и проектные менеджеры). Мы создали систему, которая охватывает все аспекты управления и учета агробизнеса.
* Создание и аналитики модуля автокредитования, потребительских кредитов, товарных кредитов в банках страны. Как результат данной работы анализирую факты могу указать что система была принята с положительными отзывами со стороны пользователей данного сервиса.
* Система аналитики и мгновенного маркетинга(realtime marketing) в условиях дорожного потока. Данный продукт имел технические сложности в реализации учитывая факторы погодного условия, скорости потока, распознавание атрибутов технических средств и дальнейшая обработка данных с целью показа эффективной рекламы на медиабордах. Мне пришлось собирать команду, искать готовые сервисы которые могут решить вопросы, предложить наилучшие решения в части финансов и точности. Как результат по окончанию презентации вопросы со стороны команд были исчерпаны, процесс разработки был адаптирован и не требовал других вмешательств в части анализа.

- effective resolution of conflict situations with current clients (for example, a client who was ready to end cooperation with an agency by working with another manager stayed and expanded the budget by more than three times working with me; erroneous waste of more than $ 10,000 by the contextual advertising team was objectively justified and did not affect further cooperation with the client),
- introduction of template automatically generated reports based on Google Spreadsheets and Google Analytics API for the whole PM team.
Then I shifted my focus to project management in web and native app development.

- Scrum-like work process reorganization,

- Effective Leadership: Successfully led a multifunctional team (development, content, design, DevOps) of over 30 members as a single manager.
- Timely Project Delivery: Delivered complex API integration projects on time despite limited resources.
- Client-Agency Conflict Resolution: Resolved intricate client-agency conflicts, turning potential losses into significant budget expansions (e.g., retained a client who was about to end cooperation and tripled their budget).
- Content Team Organization: Efficiently organized an outbound content team, including hiring and establishing work/review processes, leading to the creation of over 5,000 design items in less than two weeks.
- Automation Reporting: Developed automated reports for the digital-marketing project management team using the Google Analytics API.

product manager,"I started my journey with a desire to conquer space. Studying at the Aerospace University. While Elon Musk conquers space instead of me, I master my undertakings here on Earth. At the moment I am studying at 2 more universities in Business Management and Refereeing. He worked as an assistant to the right hand of the president of the academy and an all-Ukrainian deputy. After he created his own business for the production and branding of clothes. As a result of life changes (war), I came to the IT field, first working as SMM and SMD in top Odessa clubs and organizations. Then, as a sales manager and chief social media manager, he worked in one of the largest Ukrainian companies producing specialized clothing, footwear in the labor protection segment, as well as building materials. Having completed the course and received the highest mark in Hillel IT in the direction of Project Management, I decided to go into the world of management. The course managed to develop a start-up for the prevention of forest fires and related to satellite systems and sensing. After getting a job at the startup Resty Product Manager, our product went through all stages of development and is close to release. He also worked at Realis-network on the development of crypto-mobile games based on the blockchain system, with the implementation of his own marketplaces and the generator of his own unique NFTs. During my work, several iterations have passed with their successful testing and releases. At the same time, I got a job at a betting company as a business analyst and where I work to this day. The main place where I work is as an executive director in a company developing a CRM system. He is also a co-owner of the IT startup Neura, associated with neural networks, cryptocurrency, digital and physical fashion.
Being the host of the children's program up to 13 years old, he received the All-Ukrainian Teletriumph award. In the 10th grade he defended his scientific work at the Moscow Academy of Sciences. He entered the Aerospace University, as well as 2 others in parallel. I have always participated in all contests and competitions, I strive to be the first and the best, not on paper, but in reality.
I adapt to any conditions, our world is the uncertainty with which we struggle daily."
product manager,"After more than 10 years of front-end engineering experience, I got a new passion for enabling cross-functional engineering teams as a tech leader and have pursued this path for 3 years.
During my work at bloomon, I realized that it is interesting to help businesses and engineers understand each other, which I was good at. I received the Title of squad lead even though I was a lower-level engineer than my teammates at that point.
During the past 3 years, I've built and managed a cross-functional team focusing on web development.
Right now I am interested in larger teams, I manage a relatively small team but realize I need some next challenge!

product manager,"Hi there!
Here are a few facts about me:
— 8+ years of experience in different product companies;
— 5+ years acting as a Product Manager;
— industry expertise: PropTech, B2B SaaS, E-commerce;
— platforms: mostly web products, iOS & Android apps;
— hard skills: analyzing data & gathering insights, finding unit economics, testing & validating hypotheses, conducting qualitative research (user interviews, user testing, etc), researching market & competitors, building customer support, prototyping user interfaces, manual testing, refining AI prompts, building map layers (funny but it’s true);
— management skills: building effective communication system within the team and with different departments, motivating & mentoring team members, organizing operational teams, improving & automating processes (from Jira setup to team buildings), hiring new talents;
I have a great product sense but rely my decisions on data (where it’s possible). I love working with engineering teams and iterating new solutions to users' needs. Growing metrics and positive user feedback are probably my biggest motivation.

— increased # of users who use the map as the main real estate search tool x3.5 YoY along with increasing NPS Rate from -60% to 20% by building the experience focused on users' needs;
— shifted the development culture from task-focused to product-centric by fostering a user-first approach;
— launched the map as the real estate search tool in > 10 cities in 3 countries;
— improved the value proposition for B2B clients (real estate agencies) by launching the personal cabinet for managing their advertising campaigns and internal product for account managers resulting in +15% revenue in 2020 YoY despite the COVID-19 pandemic;
— reduced feature’s time-to-market by 50% through introducing Jira workflow and iterative releases;
Personal favorite achievements (I would love to tell the story behind them):
— organized a 2-days participative discovery workshop for a team of 70 people;
— built a prototype of the new internal product from scratch using just Google Sheets and automation;
— increased the number of websites processed by the real estate search engine x6 (from ~2000 to >12000 in 30+ countries) by parsing Google search results in the first 3 months of my career (back then I could even write some code);
I'm interested in working as a product manager and eventually growing into a leading role.
My must-haves: driven teammates, an attentive manager, and a product that impacts our lives.
My no-goes: being told what to do."

Lead Unity Developer
December 2020 - May 2021

I expect my job to provide me with the opportunity to work on a long-term, large-scale product rather than outsourced, small-scale projects. I enjoy being involved in a product from its inception to its launch and beyond, appreciating the continuity and sense of ownership that this brings.
I'm particularly drawn to large projects where my contributions can make a significant impact. The complexity and challenge that come with larger-scale work are aspects that I find professionally fulfilling.
In terms of work culture, I highly value autonomy. I believe in having the freedom to make decisions about my work, as this independence fosters creativity and productivity. I expect an environment that encourages autonomy and respects individual decision-making.
One of my passions is mentoring and teaching others. I hope for opportunities where I can share my knowledge and skills with colleagues, helping to cultivate a learning environment.
Lastly, it's crucial to mention some areas I'd rather not venture into. I am not interested in working on adult content or slot machines. The latter often being fast-paced, seasonal projects that don't match my preference for longer-term involvement. Additionally, I am less interested in web development work due to its limitations in terms of self-expression. I am looking for a role where my creativity can be fully utilized and not restricted."
product manager,"For the past 8 years, I’ve worked with intranets and digital workplaces. My experience includes working with clients from all over the world. I have worked on projects for SMB businesses and multinational corporations, including companies from sectors such as telecom, IT, banking, sales, and others.
I have worked as a project manager for intranet launches, digital transformations, product launches, and support projects. Every project included custom development, so I have solid experience working with the development team and establishing and maintaining communication between the development team and the client. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in quality assurance (manual testing) and UI/UX design, so attention to detail is one of my top priorities.
For the past two years, I’ve worked as a product manager for two products, specifically made for the LumApps platform. From inception to deployment, I have managed these products through all key stages of development, giving me a comprehensive understanding of the product lifecycle.
As a product manager, I have held many demo and training meetings, so I am comfortable communicating and demonstrating the best features of products and developments to new and existing customers at different levels (from top management to the IT department and the end users).
I also have experience working as a team lead. This position included task prioritization, conflict resolution, ensuring high-quality deliverables, meeting deadlines, setting business expectations, and resolving issues effectively.
My main priorities as a manager have always been responsibility, coordination, flexibility, willingness to learn, openness to negotiation, and a focus on achieving mutual benefits for all parties involved.
About me. I have PhD in philosophy. I speak English, Ukrainian, and Russian. I like reading, playing board games, and drawing. I am good at brainstorming for new ideas and non-standard solutions for various issues. I volunteer in the project NUMO, which aims to help people learn Ukrainian and raise funds to support Ukraine's efforts in the ongoing war.

Хочу працювати з технологіями, які змінюють ринок: блокчейн, AI, фінтех, медтех, а не займатися «косметичними покращеннями» старих рішень.
Прозорі процеси та автономія – ціную чітку стратегію розвитку продукту, обґрунтовані рішення та автономність у прийнятті рішень, без мікроменеджменту.
Команда професіоналів – хочу працювати з людьми, які горять своєю справою, обмінюватися знаннями, розвивати культуру Agile, Lean, Data-driven підходу.
Чітке бачення та підтримка керівництва – важливо, щоб продуктові цілі були зрозумілими, а не змінювалися хаотично без стратегії.
Масштабність та можливості для зростання – хочу бачити перспективу розвитку всередині компанії, реальний вплив на бізнес та можливість розвивати лідерські навички.
Адекватний баланс роботи та життя – розумію, що іноді бувають дедлайни, але хронічний овертайм без результату – це не ефективно."

I specialize in increasing the efficiency of remote teams. After COVID, this format of work has become the most common, and I have focused my practical knowledge of each stage of development on building trust within teams.
My meticulous and perfectionist approach is quite demanding, so in order to have these rules accepted by the team, I practice three key rules: respect, transparent encouragement of efficiency (because that's why we're all here) and my detailed expertise.
5 years of work as a game designer and 7 years in the roles of Producer or PM, controlling teams of 150+ specialists and successful products that were fully in my responsibility - give me the opportunity to speak with the team in the same language.
With a big Game-designer experience in previous years, i have gained an in-depth understanding of what it takes to make a successful development team. Additionally, my experience as a Product Manager, responsible for overseeing every aspect of a project, including some quite successful cases, demonstrates my skillset and sense of responsibility.
My work on the highly-anticipated STALKER2 project at GSC further highlights my growth in competencies. I have also worked on multiple side projects, which have allowed me to expand my knowledge and skillset even further.
Overall, my extensive experience and passion for the industry make me confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to any project. I am eager to continue growing and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development."

Proficient in cross-functional leadership, agile methodologies, and driving customer-centric product design through extensive user research. Equipped with a Master's in Economics, adept at product strategy, data-driven decision-making, and effective communication.
In my career, before starting work with products, I had experience in user retention and business process management at Kyivstar. I joined Prom.ua, an EVO project, in its early stages as a business process specialist, taking on roles in sales management, launching a dealer direction, establishing client service standards, and managing quality, contact centers, and relationships with dealer agencies. I participated as a project leader in the launch of zakupivli.pro, another EVO project, where I managed client relationships and product development for procurement professionals. From an idea, we built a company together with a team that became a market leader in public procurement. I took on the role of product manager at Prozorro, the company administering Ukraine’s public procurement system. Over three years, I was a driver of new ideas, products, programs, and processes in Ukraine’s public procurement system from the administrator’s side. My most recent role is at WEZOM, a company focused on client-centric products, where I work as a product manager. I bring strong knowledge and experience in market analysis, conducting user interviews, product management strategy, stakeholder collaboration, national legislation changes, UX/UI, prioritizing requirements, features, and tasks, and validating hypotheses. In teams, I serve as a consultant, leader, and the one who understands what we’re doing, why, and what value we deliver to the client, while also taking responsibility for decisions.
I still see myself in product development, more towards strategy over time. I want to move more towards fintech, more use of data for decision-making and Financial crimes prevention.
I have experience in both launching products and projects from idea to working product and improving existing products. I have experience transforming chaos into a functioning company based on a system of metrics. I have experience launching systems and products for hundreds of thousands of users with high efficiency and satisfaction for both users and stakeholders. Naturally, in each product, there were specific steps based on improving particular elements and resulting metrics.
As a Product Manager, I am looking for the opportunity to have:
Effective Ownership: I want to take full ownership of the product lifecycle—from idea to launch and beyond—to deliver solutions that solve real customer problems and deliver measurable business value.
Collaboration and Influence: I thrive in cross-functional environments where I can work closely with engineering, design, and marketing teams to develop a shared vision while championing user needs and strategic goals.
Growth Through Challenge: I am looking for a role that challenges me to solve complex problems, adapt to evolving markets, and innovate in the face of uncertainty. I want to develop my skills in data-driven decision-making, prioritization, and stakeholder management.
Culture of Trust: I value an environment that encourages open communication, constructive feedback, and autonomy that allows me to experiment, learn from failure, and iterate quickly.
Alignment to Purpose: I want to contribute to important products—whether they’re improving lives, advancing technology, or strengthening the company’s mission. Knowing that my work is connected to the bigger picture keeps me motivated."

product manager,"З досвідом понад 5 років у сфері роздрібної торгівлі, я успішно керував командами, впроваджував нові стратегії для збільшення прибутку та покращення якості обслуговування клієнтів. На позиції директора магазину моїми ключовими завданнями були стратегічне планування, розвиток персоналу, оптимізація операційних процесів та підвищення ефективності продажів.
Серед досягнень — реалізація ініціатив із покращення сервісу, що збільшили рівень лояльності клієнтів, а також адаптація бізнесу до змін ринку.
Зараз я зосереджений на поглибленні знань у сфері сучасних технологій, включаючи штучний інтелект, щоб інтегрувати інноваційні рішення у бізнес-процеси. Я прагну розвиватися у напрямку управління масштабними проектами, впровадження автоматизації та оптимізації продажів, а також покращення внутрішніх бізнес-систем.
У команді я завжди орієнтований на результат, виступаю лідером та наставником для співробітників, що дозволяє досягати амбітних цілей.
1. Збільшення прибутку магазину на 20%:
Завдяки впровадженню нових стратегій продажів, оптимізації асортименту та аналізу поведінки клієнтів вдалося значно підвищити фінансові показники.
2. Розширення команди та підвищення її ефективності:
Успішно збільшив кількість співробітників на 50% із збереженням високої якості обслуговування. Організував навчання та мотиваційні програми, що покращило продуктивність на 30%.
3. Впровадження стандартів обслуговування клієнтів:
Розробив і реалізував програми підвищення якості сервісу, які підняли рівень задоволеності клієнтів до 95% за результатами опитувань.
4. Оптимізація операційних процесів:
Зменшив витрати на 15% шляхом оптимізації логістичних ланцюгів та автоматизації рутинних завдань.
5. Успішне управління кризовими ситуаціями:
Швидко адаптував бізнес до змін ринку, забезпечивши стабільність роботи магазину та утримання ключових показників у складних умовах.
6. Запуск нових проектів:
Організував відкриття додаткових торгових точок, що дозволило збільшити частку ринку компанії.
Ці досягнення демонструють мою здатність досягати високих результатів навіть у динамічних і конкурентних умовах.
Чого я очікую від роботи:
Я шукаю стабільність і конкурентну оплату праці, яка відповідатиме моїм знанням та досвіду. Для мене важливим є кар’єрний ріст і розвиток — я прагну працювати в компанії, яка підтримує професійне зростання. Очікую, що мої досягнення будуть визнані та оцінені. Також для мене важливий баланс між роботою та особистим життям, тому я ціную гнучкий графік.
Чого я хочу:
Я хочу працювати в динамічному середовищі, де зможу застосовувати свої навички в управлінні, стратегічному плануванні та розвитку команд. Для мене важливо мати чіткі цілі та завдання, щоб бачити конкретний результат своєї роботи. Мене мотивує можливість впроваджувати нові ідеї та технології для оптимізації процесів. Крім того, я ціную командну роботу, де є можливість співпрацювати та обмінюватися досвідом.
Чого я не хочу:
Я не бачу себе в роботі без перспектив розвитку чи в середовищі, де відсутня чітка стратегія. Токсична атмосфера або відсутність командної підтримки також неприйнятні для мене. Я не готовий працювати в умовах нестабільності або братися за рутинні завдання, які не дозволяють розкривати потенціал.
Ці принципи відображають мої пріоритети та допомагають обирати правильну роботу."

product manager,"I have 10+ years of experience in product management, working across Generative AI, EdTech, Robotics, Retail, Equity Research, and Capital Markets. I’ve led the development of AI-driven SaaS platforms, autonomy modules for UAVs, and enterprise-grade financial solutions, taking products from concept to launch and driving measurable business impact. My expertise spans roadmap development, user growth strategies, competitive research, and cross-functional team leadership. I enjoy working in fast-moving environments, whether it’s bringing an MVP to market, scaling a product, or optimizing key business metrics through data-driven decision-making.
In Robotics, I led the development of autonomy modules for UAVs, focusing on last-mile targeting and navigation in denied environments. I worked hands-on, testing the product in real conditions, learning to pilot UAVs, and even assembling them from parts. In less than six months, I went from zero experience in embedded and hardware development to a deep technical understanding, enabling me to engage in global tech partnerships.
In Generative AI SaaS, I have led the development of AI-driven B2C platforms - one in EdTech and another one in voice cloning technology, shaping product vision, execution, and growth strategies.
In Retail SaaS, I led the development of a Category optimization B2B platform for retailers, leveraging machine learning and applied statistics. Starting from an early concept, I defined the roadmap, collaborated with industry experts, and built the entire engineering team from scratch.
In Equity Research, I helped expand an analytics platform beyond private equity into public equity research, strengthening its competitive position. I translated business needs into engineering tasks, managed third-party API partnerships, and kept product vision aligned across teams.
In Capital Markets, I started as a junior business analyst and grew into a senior leadership role, leading a team of 10+ engineers. I was deeply involved in risk and pricing solutions, working on distributed computation systems for the interest rate derivatives unit. I also mentored business analysts into senior roles and built a knowledge-sharing process across teams.
Across all industries, I focus on building products with real impact, combining strategic vision with hands-on execution to drive business success.
I’m looking for my next challenge in startups, AI, and analytics, with a focus on strategic and visionary roles where I can shape product direction and drive long-term impact. I enjoy building realistic strategies and roadmaps based on measurable data and market research. I want to put my energy into products and companies that solve real problems and create real value.
I actively support Ukraine and want to work with people who share pro-Ukrainian values, ideally in a non-Russian-speaking culture. I thrive in environments that foster trust and autonomy, so I stay away from micromanagement. I’m also not interested in gambling, casinos, or anything remotely scammy."

product manager,"Маю 8 років досвіду в продуктовому менеджменті та маркетингу. Основні напрямки — e-commerce, маркетплейси, мобільні додатки та subscription-based продукти.
Останні роки працюю з ринком Tier-1, до цього мала досвід роботи на українському ринку.
Зараз я працюю в e-commerce проєкті, який є частиною екосистеми популярного health & fitness додатка (топ-3 фітнес-додаток у світі, 100 млн завантажень) на позиції Senior Product Manager. До цього працювала з маркетплейсами та мобільними додатками.
Маю досвід роботи як у великих компаніях, так і запуску нових продуктів з нуля (web та app).
Працюю у тісній співпраці з розробниками, маркетологами, аналітиками та дизайнерами. Відповідаю за повний життєвий цикл продукту – від ідеї до запуску, аналізу ефективності та подальшого покращення. Фокусуюся на зростанні ARPU, підвищенні конверсії та покращенні користувацького досвіду.
Куди хочу розвиватися
Мене цікавлять e-commerce проєкти або subscription-based продукти.
BetterMe:
1. +21% до конверсії сайту завдяки оптимізації UX/UI та роботі з аналітикою.
2. Збільшення виручки від in-app покупок.

4. Запуск партнерських кампаній із Visa та логістичними службами для залучення нових підписників.
Що для мене важливо в проєкті:
Цікавий продукт, який має потенціал для масштабування.
Монетизація, зростання, оптимізація – цікавлять ролі, де я можу працювати з продуктовою аналітикою, A/B тестуваннями, підвищенням конверсії.
Вплив на бізнес-результат – хочу мати можливість самостійно приймати рішення та бачити їх реальний ефект на фінансові показники компанії."

product manager,"Over the past few years, I’ve been working on complex IT projects in both public and private sectors, including GovTech and defence-related domains. My key responsibilities included analyzing and improving business processes, gathering and clarifying requirements, writing technical documentation, managing stakeholders, and leading communication between cross-functional teams.
I regularly use Jira, Confluence, Google Workspace, Miro, and BPMN modeling tools like Cawemo. I’ve collaborated with engineering teams working on modern stacks (including AI and ML), though my focus remains on requirements, planning, coordination, and delivery. I’m also familiar with using SDLC frameworks such as Agile (Scrum/Kanban) and traditional Waterfall, depending on the project's context.
In my current hybrid role, I act as a bridge between the business side and technical teams. I handle requirements clarification, backlog grooming, and sprint planning, while also facilitating workshops, demos, and retrospective meetings. I help translate business needs into implementable features and ensure transparent communication across stakeholders.
Also I worked in HR field, where I gained solid experience in resource planning, talent management, and organizational development. I was responsible for aligning people strategies with project needs, managing recruitment pipelines, and supporting workforce capacity planning. This background has been invaluable in cross-functional environments, where understanding team dynamics, workload distribution, and soft skills plays a key role in project success.
Successfully launched over three digital products into production, with ongoing work to adapt solutions for additional clients. Some of these projects are built on AI/ML-based architectures, requiring close collaboration between data teams, analysts, and developers. Overcame challenges such as unclear or changing business requirements, limited initial documentation, and resource constraints — which required flexible planning, backlog reprioritization, and proactive stakeholder communication.
I expect the new project to provide opportunities for personal growth, where I can develop my skills. I’m eager to take on interesting and challenging projects that will allow me to gain new experiences, expand my knowledge, and continuously improve my abilities. My focus will be on driving results, ensuring clear communication between business and technical teams, and managing the project from start to finish."

product manager,"The most fascinating aspect of my work has been participating in large-scale projects focused on digital transformation and business process optimization for numerous companies. I have worked with a wide range of businesses, helping them modernize outdated systems, set up, and restructure key processes to improve efficiency, enhance customer experience, and implement digital innovations.
Additionally, I simultaneously managed two key areas within the organization: conducting audits for companies where we implemented business processes and leading the internal development of a large-scale project to create a service. Managing these directions required exceptional multitasking and strategic planning skills, as well as the ability to balance immediate operational needs with long-term business goals.
The audits aimed to assess the current state of companies, identify bottlenecks in their processes, and develop tailored solutions for optimization. Following the audits, I implemented business processes that enhanced productivity, efficiency, and the quality of customer service.
Within digital transformation initiatives, I collaborated closely with IT, marketing, operations teams, and senior management to ensure alignment and successful implementation. One of the most exciting aspects was the integration of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and automation, into the company’s operations. This required in-depth research, vendor evaluation, and the design of customized solutions tailored to the organization’s specific needs.
I also took the lead in creating and optimizing internal business processes to ensure efficiency and scalability. By designing workflows, defining key performance indicators (KPIs), and implementing performance tracking systems, I contributed to building a robust operational foundation that supports the company’s growth.
The projects also involved large-scale change management. I led communication and training initiatives to ensure the smooth adoption of new systems and processes by employees across the organization. It was highly rewarding to witness the positive impact these changes had on productivity and employee satisfaction.
Overall, these experiences provided a unique opportunity to drive transformation and create lasting value for organizations. They challenged me to think strategically, solve complex problems, and lead diverse teams toward shared goals. Balancing multiple high-impact directions not only enhanced my

product manager,"18 years in digital with a mix of experience on product and marketing agency sides.
During the first 6 years of my career as a Project/Product Manager I was managing development of digital platforms which included a few web-portals, a eCommerce project and even a niche social network. During that time I mastered planning, budgeting and estimating project development, hiring and managing web-dev teams (had up to 14 people team on remote), running the development process on all product stages and of course communicating with stakeholders to make products which reach the planned KPIs an satisfy expectations of all parties involved.
Then I had 8 years building and executing marketing strategies for global A-level brands as a Digital Strategy Head in a marketing agency. In that period I had a team of strategists and analytics under my mentorship and supervision, got 7 global Effie awards for effective campaigns and mastered digital marketing to the level of being able to manage product marketing teams.
During that time I also created and tutored online and offline courses on Digital Strategy including a 40-hour online course which ran 3 times, one offline course accredited by Chartered Institute of Marketing, a few MBA programs and countless guest-classes and lectures. Around 1000 students have finished courses led by me and my CIM group had a 100% pass rate, approved by British CIM headquarters.
Now I combine skills in leading web development and digital marketing – in Product Management. Last 3 years as a Product Manager I built and tested products from idea to PMF stage using no-code/low-code tools in the corporate startup incubator. The AI SaaS startup which evolved from that incubator under my lead and which I manage as a Founder now – reached a 10-person team and $100k MRR in the first year and $400k Revenue in 2 years on the market.
Currently I'm considering a remote Senior Product Manager position in startup, product or a medium size product company, which are serving EU or US markets and have AI in the product core. Ready to manage other PMs, lead the process of building a products from scratch and/or educating on that process if needed.
BBA in Marketing. Fluent English. Excellent management and communication skills. Extensive lecturing/mentoring experience including MBA programs.
- AI SaaS startup which I lead now – grew from idea to $100k MRR and from 1 to 10 team members in year 1 and has reached $400k revenue by year 2
- My digital strategy projects for global brands got 7 Effie awards for effective marketing
- 1000+ students passed my digital strategy courses, including  a program certified by Chartered Institute of Marketing
- Started working remotely 7 years ago when it was far from being a trend
- Visited 50+ countries, working remotely full time
- Startup, product or a product company
- Medium-sized team
- Own AI-based product
- EU/US market
- Mental health domain would be a plus"

My responsibilities included defining and prioritizing product features, collaborating with designers and engineers to ensure smooth development, and conducting market research to understand user needs.

At Campusrunz, I led projects like the Nano loan feature, where I gathered user feedback, developed feature requirements, and ensured timely delivery to meet the needs of our 15,000+ users.
In terms of technologies, I used tools like JIRA for backlog management, Figma to review design prototypes, and analytics tools for market research and user insights. My role emphasized strategy and coordination, but I’m looking to improve my technical knowledge, particularly in understanding APIs and data structures, to better collaborate with engineers. Additionally, I want to deepen my expertise in customer onboarding and engagement strategies to deliver long-term value to users.
As a Product Manager, I’ve successfully contributed to building impactful, user-centric solutions.

In every role, I focus on delivering value, driving innovation, and solving real customer problems
What I Want from Work
