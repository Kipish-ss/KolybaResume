.net,"I am working for 3 years as a software engineer on various projects for a foreign customer involved into creating a solution to enable customers (primarly Law and Business) to create their own templates, forms etc. to fill out. I was working on a Cloud solution that would run these artifacts, WinForms-based Word add-in that is used to create them and also e-commerce website for authors, which want to sell these templates.
For the web projects I have been creating business-logic APIs, introducing systems such as global and context-senstivie error handling mechansims, Single-Sign On, localization. There was also a project that I built from scratch, which enabled our customers to invoke some admin actions such as managing their users, running CRON tasks, watching statistics etc. I have also took part in creating CRON and CI/CD tasks based on both .NET CLI apps and PowerShell scripts. One of these projects used to utilize WCF, jQuery, old ASP.NET, plain SQL stack and I helped updating it to ASP.NET Core, Vue, Entity Framework Core combination, which drasticallly increased our efficiency in introducing new features as well as onboarding new teammates.
As for the Word add-in project, the company wanted to consolidate Web and add-ins frontends and significantly ovehaul it's visual appearance, therefore? I was asked to replace the most vital parts of this application with WebView frontend making it work like an Electron app. There I mainly operated on the frontend part, organizing the communication between WebView and C# layers, writing view-scoped logic and creating forms with Vue for users to author their own templates.
I also have some side experience with PHP-based CMS (WordPress, OpenCart): I fixed some parts of commercial website for that aforementioned company and also completed freelance orders of creating websites for businesses, which were providing heating and made sushi.
I would like to develop myself in a more sophisticated architectural solutions, which would involve such techniques as Clean Architecture, CQRS, ES, DDD etc. I am testing these in my pet-project, but want to see how masters adapt these into their applications.
During my commercial career I have done a lot of tasks, but I am most proud of these ones:
* I have globally updated customer's old techonology stack to a new one: WCF to REST, ADO.NET to EntityFramework/Dapper (for niche cases), jQuery-driven frontend to Vue + BootstrapVue etc.
* I have introduced a range of global mechanisms like context-sensitive/global error handling, localization, handling of multiple concurrent login sessions etc.
* I have composed an architecture for Word add-in, which was utilizing WebView: the way it communicates with C# backend, reuses similar forms, processes UI templates and so on.
* I have integrated our application with SSO backed by identity provider PingIdentity via SAML protocol.
* I have created a system to process our clients' on-premises filesystems. It consisted of C# tasks like cleaning up unnecessary log files, assembling cache-like artefacts etc, which were run via Task Scheduler.
Also, some of my pet-projects feature stuff like:
* Real-time updating of booking statuses via SignalR.
* Integration with payment gateway LiqPay.
I am primarly looking for developing Web systems, in which I would mainly work on the backend part, but I also definitely do not mind working on a Desktop app, tools development or creating rather simple frontends. Ideally, I would like to gain experience with projects that utilize advanced architectural patterns and have a dive into functional programming paradigm."

.net,"Experienced .NET Developer with over 8 years in software development and 5 years of full-stack expertise. Proven track record in delivering robust B2B, fintech, and enterprise-grade solutions. Skilled in cloud migration, infrastructure setup, DevOps practices, and cross-functional collaboration. Strong understanding of modern .NET technologies, cloud services (Azure), and frontend frameworks (Angular, TypeScript).
— Automated legacy system deployment, which was previously performed manually — introduced scripted infrastructure setup with the ability to deploy additional nodes on demand, significantly reducing operational overhead.
— Led the migration of a legacy ASP.NET MVC web application to a modern Single Page Application (SPA) using ASP.NET Core and Angular — improved performance, maintainability, and user experience.
— Deep customization of DevExtreme components to meet complex UI/UX and business logic requirements — enhanced functionality and responsiveness of enterprise dashboards and forms.
— Set up full CI/CD lifecycle in Azure DevOps — from branch policies and pull request validation to automated pipelines that build, test, deploy to staging environments, and apply database migrations. This workflow streamlined delivery and reduced release errors.
I am open to both maintaining and modernizing legacy systems — I find satisfaction in improving existing codebases and evolving them into more efficient and scalable solutions, as long as the complexity and effort are fairly recognized.
At the same time, I enjoy being part of early-stage projects where architecture decisions are still being made and development starts from scratch. This gives me space to apply best practices from the ground up.
Based on my experience, I find the most motivation in:
— Compact teams and smaller-scale projects where I can take broad ownership across frontend, backend, testing, CI/CD, and infrastructure.
— Large-scale systems where I can focus on a well-defined domain — such as core logic, vertical modules, or a specific infrastructure layer.
— Products that provide real value — solving meaningful problems for end-users or enabling business innovation.
— Technically unique or high-load solutions that challenge conventional thinking and involve advanced tools, architectures, or performance concerns.
Ultimately, I appreciate engineering environments that value transparency, continuous learning, and mutual respect."

I also have experience in setting up static routing in networks and working with the ARP protocol. My projects involve developing scalable and efficient web applications that deliver high performance and user convenience.
Expectations from work:
I am looking for a job that allows me to grow as a professional by working on interesting and challenging projects. It is important for me to have the opportunity to implement new technologies and approaches, as well as participate in the development of large-scale and innovative solutions. I value teamwork and open communication, as I believe that collaboration leads to better results. Additionally, I appreciate a healthy work-life balance, so I am seeking working conditions that allow for effective time management.

.net,"I've been developing BE solutions using C# since 2017.
In 2022, in a month after the war started, I joined the project where I've been working on backend development from zero. For a couple of years I was the only person responsible for the new BE development. The old BE was written using ASP .NET MVC framework, wasn't reliable and was hard to maintain, observe and develop. The new BE was started on .NET 5, now it works on .NET 8. The new BE supports two types of API: GraphQL and REST. Each API type serves different types of consumers. The REST API processes more than 5000 requests per minute, the number of queries is growing, but the BE has a margin of safety. I can tell you a lot about the new BE because a lot has already been done.
As a software developer I'm good at:
- building high performance, scalable and reliable backend applications using C# and ASP .NET Core framework;
- MS SQL Server - writing and reading complex queries, I'm able to understand what's going on looking at the query execution plan;
- Entity Framework - writing complex queries using its fluent API as well as knowing other subtleties how to use it properly;
- GraphQL - creation of GQL API using Hot Chocolate;
- Azure - using and managing of Front door, App services, SQL Database, Service Bus, Application insights, Dashboards and some other.
I haven't used the following on my current project, but these are what I used on my previous job:
- Kubernetes;
- Kafka;
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL;
- ElasticSearch;

The project was interesting in that it was necessary to write code that depended on a huge amount of hardware that was called by an external API. Engaged in the development and periodically led the team. Also, architected several big features.
Project 3(Current): Lead engineer of a team(4 .net, 2 fe, 2 aqa).

Prende Health
In this company, I've worked on a product for medical stuff based on AI technologies, such as OpenAI Chat GPT and Azure Cognitive Services (Speech To Text).
As a result, an automatic call center was created, which accepts calls and talks to the clients, determines their data, the reason for the call, and even their mood.
The other part of the app is a dashboard for call center workers, where a person can monitor statuses and transcriptions of the call, or take them over.
The main technologies are:
ASP.NET 7.0, Docker, React, MobX, Svelte, Azure SQL Database,
Azure DevOps.
Other tools and products used: Twilio for telephony, Pusher for real-time updates (.NET and Javascript on the client side).

The final solution consisted of a front-end part written with React and
Office.js library, a back-end proxy part written with ASP.NET 6.0 Web
API and the Workday API. Authorization was implemented with an SSO
and an existing client’s identity provider."

.net,"At my previous job as a .NET full-stack developer in a commercial team project, I developed a live streaming service for auto racing events that served 150+ users, working in a team with a Python developer and a manager to deliver an MVP in 1 month. I regularly updated the service with new features, increasing user count by 20% on launch, and automated a significant part of the deployment process, speeding it up by 2,5 times.
Some of my pet projects include a desktop stamp and seals editor in Java, where I heavily applied the polymorphism principle; a proof-of-concept .NET application, where I tried Azure Functions, Blob Storage, and unit testing; and a Telegram bot written in Python in a pair with another developer, that I deployed to Azure in a Docker container.
One of my biggest accomplishments from my previous job is creating the application without knowing much about the technology behind it at first. I had to quickly learn about setting up an RTMP server with Nginx, media encoding with FFmpeg, and how everything works together, all while building the web application on .NET. Despite the challenges, I successfully delivered a working solution.
I would love to advance in the DevOps path, trying more CI/CD tools and focusing on the backend side overall."

.net,"I spent two years working as a blockchain developer before shifting my focus to .NET and React development. I was involved in building landing pages using Next.js and developed a website from scratch (using .NET, React, and SQL Server) for hosting and solving physics and mathematics tasks.
For over a year, I have been contributing to a complex physics-mathematics project, implementing new functionality across the database, backend, and frontend. Some of the most interesting tasks I’ve worked on include:
- Migrating a project from .NET Framework 4.5.2 to .NET 8
- Migrating the database from SQL Server to PostgreSQL
- Creating a tool to convert an SQL database into a set of JSON files
I also worked a lot with charts and diagrams, using the FlotCharts library and AngularJS — a technology I hadn't used before :)
My biggest achievement is that I became a developer entirely on my own, without ever attending any courses.
I am looking for a long-term job where I can work with my favorite technologies and eventually become a team leader. I’m only considering on-site work and am ready to relocate to another city, so a fun and friendly team atmosphere is important to me. I enjoy participating in various events and organizing hiking trips. I would also be happy to attend internal English lessons."

Основними напрямками моєї роботи є розробка як веб-додатків, так і клієнт-серверних додатків на платформі .NET. Розробляю масштабовані та гнучкі рішення, використовуючи найкращі практики та принципи розробки. Мій досвід також включає оптимізацію коду, запитів до бази даних і скорочення їх кількості, впровадження кешування для прискорення роботи сервісів, веб-сайтів.
Працював з різними технологіями та інструментами, основні з них – .NET, ASP.NET Core (MVC), Winforms, EF Core, Linq, SignalR та інші. Використовував такі технології як: REST API, WebSocket, gRPC для обміну даними між різними системами, мікросервісами. Також маю досвід у розробці HTML, CSS, JavaScript (TypeScript), Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap. Працював з базами даних SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, T-SQL (тригери, процедури, користувацькі функції). Загалом, мій досвід розробки додатків на .NET дозволяє мені створювати високоякісні та ефективні рішення, що відповідають вимогам бізнесу. Інтегрував платіжні системи, включаючи Binance, Perfect Money, FreeKassa, FKWallet, BetaTransfer та Payport.
Маю досвід розробки плагінів для браузера (Chrome Extensions). Використовував Puppeteer, Playwright для автоматизації різних завдань. Працював над створенням проксі-серверів.
Реалізовані проекти: маркетплейс дитячих таборів, особистий кабінет замовника, Unity тренажери, автоматизовані парсери, проксі сервери, фінансова платформа для торгівлі, різноманітні мікросервіси та десктоп-програми і т.д
У моєму досвіді успішно впроваджено використання технології з мульти-набором даних із процедури спільно з EF Core. Це дозволило оптимізувати та підвищити продуктивність програми шляхом отримання кількох наборів даних зі сховища одним запитом. Такий підхід знизив кількість запитів до бази даних та покращив ефективність програми на 30%. Також я працював над прискоренням процесів внесення великих потоків даних у систему. В результаті моїх дій час процесу скоротився з 46 хвилин до 1 хвилини і 40 секунд з однаковими даними. Таким чином модуль був прискорений на 96%."

.net,"I was part of a team building and maintaining a fintech product. My role involved developing the backend of the application using ASP.NET Core, where I built RESTful APIs to facilitate interaction with the frontend.
For data management, we used Entity Framework Core and OData. We chose Oracle DB and MS SQL Server as our databases depending on specific needs.
The frontend of the application was implemented using Angular, where we used Angular Material components to create a modern and intuitive interface. For reactive programming, we used RxJs and NgRx libraries, which allowed us to create a dynamic and efficient application.
To ensure high code quality, I wrote Unit tests and Integration tests using NUnit, Karma, and Jasmine frameworks. This allowed for quick detection and correction of errors, as well as ensuring the stability of the application.

-Developed Kubernetes-like Elasticsearch orchestration infrastructure. In the scope, I implemented a single-node service to store in-memory IndexesContext(i.e. etcd), IndexManagerWorker (i.e. Controller Manager) along with IndexManagers(i.e. Controller). Also, applied concurrency limitations using SemaphoreSlim and lock pattern.
- Implemented the RabbitMq consumers that allowed admins to view the current state of the cluster, manually trigger index rebuilds, and trigger rebuilds if customer data changed in real time.  As a result, these changes allowed Devs, QAs, and AQAs to troubleshoot and deploy Elastic-related issues/changes faster
- Separated DataContext to account for different teams. In the scope, I applied Azure SQL performance recommendations(i.e. index and query optimizations). As a consequence, we saw top percentile execution time drop from 10s to 2-3s on some queries. Moreover, these changes led to a smoother UX experience(i.e. 'Manage Tags' page, tagging companies, etc.) for our customers

.net,"I am working as a software engineer for over a decade (11+ years).
Throughout the years worked with different projects for different companies (remote roles, collaborating with Italy, SA, and UK, and on-site roles) mainly working as a full stack engineer focused on the backend/ frontend and CI-CD. In the majority of the companies I worked for I have been engaged in team lead roles as well (facilitating sprint refinement, planning and reviews, code reviews, coaching and helping other peers give their best).
Started in 2013 as mobile app developer working (building android apps with java) and then moved to cross-platform app development with Xamarin, React-Native (a little Ionic Cordova). In the meantime I was working on the backend (domain analysis, system design and development). Different projects required me to work with Serverless (AWS or Azure functions) or Microservices architecture with .Net Core microservices (following Domain Driven Design principles and CQRS pattern).
One major focus on the last 4 years has been React which I used in lots of projects.  Recently I have been working with NextJS as well (PWAs).
Setting up CI-CD pipelines (unless we had a devops team) have been part of my working and for that I used tools such (CircleCI, DroneCI, TeamCity, Fastlane, Github Actions, Azure Pipelines).
I have a good knowledge of AWS and even bootraped projects from scratch to production via ECS, ECR, Route53, EC2, RDS, Redis  (infrastructure was provisioned through IaC yaml templates using Cloudformation).
In the software development I really emphasize and advocate for clean code, correctly designed with patterns that allow scalability, maintainability and being testable. Also performance is such an important thing to keep in mind and to review from time to time when building software (what ever kind).
I love working on fast-paced, team-oriented, deadline-driven environments and also I am very people centric because at the end of the day we are humans and I always believed in helping and supporting each other can only lead to great outputs/results.
Working closely in a big project for one of the giant clients in SA (MC Donald's)
I would like to have to do with companies/roles that offer paid time off because I think it's very important for an engineer to have the possibility to take time off comfortably. We need to recharge oftentimes and knowing that we can recharge well, adds a lot of extra motivation."

.net,"Over the past 10+ years, I've had the chance to work on projects across finance, healthcare, and automotive domains. I’ve dealt with everything from desktop applications to SaaS platforms and microservices architectures. The tech stack has grown with the times. I’ve been hands-on with .NET from its early Framework days through .NET Core (up to version 8), alongside frontend frameworks like WPF, Blazor, and Angular (the latest versions). Throw in some good old jQuery and Knockout.js from earlier projects for nostalgia's sake.
Responsibilities I’ve Owned
• Building resilient backend systems and designing application architectures.
• Developing full-stack solutions with a balance of frontend polish and backend efficiency.
• Migrating legacy systems to modern frameworks and architectures.
• Writing clean, maintainable code and solving the puzzles that inevitably pop up in software development.
What’s Next for Me?
I’m keen to dive deeper into system design, database optimization, and multi-cloud architectures—those areas where complexity really comes into play. While .NET is my home base, I’m curious about branching into Rust or embedded systems down the line. Ultimately, I want to work on tech that challenges me to grow while solving meaningful problems."

The bot also featured a gamification element with a points system. Users could participate in quizzes, where points were awarded for correct answers. These points were used to rank participants in the system.
Development of a Telegram bot in C# for tracking currencies and margins on Binance
I developed a Telegram bot with the functionality to select specific currencies and banks. The bot was integrated with the Binance exchange, fetched current currency rates, and automatically checked the margin. When certain conditions were met, the bot sent notifications to users with information about the margin and potential trading opportunities.
Website development using C#
I worked on developing a website using C# and ASP.NET. My tasks included building the server-side logic, creating a functional user interface, and integrating the database using technologies like Entity Framework.
I developed automation scripts in C# using Selenium to interact with web pages. These scripts automated tasks such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, navigating through multiple pages, and extracting data from web elements.

.net,"Throughout my career, I've led and contributed to a diverse range of software development projects that have significantly enhanced my expertise in .NET technologies and full-stack development:
At Godwit Haven, I architected and implemented a microservices-based logistics management system using .NET Core and C# that processes over 10,000 daily transactions. The system integrates with multiple third-party logistics providers through RESTful APIs, enabling real-time tracking and inventory management. My current role as Lead Software Engineer involves overseeing a team of 8 developers, establishing coding standards, conducting code reviews, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality solutions.
I've worked extensively with Entity Framework for data access, implemented caching strategies for performance optimization, and designed scalable database architectures in SQL Server and PostgreSQL. For frontend development, I've integrated React and Angular applications with .NET Core backend services, ensuring seamless user experiences.
Looking ahead, I'm focused on improving my expertise in Azure DevOps and expanding my knowledge of .NET  features to build more efficient and scalable applications. I'm also keen to enhance my skills in implementing automated testing frameworks to ensure more robust application reliability.
My most significant professional achievements demonstrate my ability to deliver impactful solutions and lead technical teams effectively:
Performance Optimization: At Godwit Haven, I identified and resolved performance bottlenecks in our inventory management system by implementing database indexing strategies, query optimization, and caching mechanisms. This initiative reduced system response time by 50% and improved throughput by 40%, allowing the system to handle peak loads of 10,000+ daily transactions without degradation.
CI/CD Implementation: I established a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitLab and AWS for a logistics management application, incorporating automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment automation. This reduced deployment time from 3 hours to just 45 minutes (60% reduction) and decreased production bugs by 35% by catching issues earlier in the development cycle.
Microservices Architecture: At Reveation Labs, I led the transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based system using .NET Core and Docker. This transformation improved system reliability by 28%, reduced deployment risks, and enabled independent scaling of system components. The new architecture allowed our team to release updates to individual services without affecting the entire application, significantly improving our development velocity.
Technical Growth: I'm looking for an environment that encourages continuous learning and staying at the forefront of .NET technologies. Regular opportunities to work with the latest frameworks and tools are important for my professional development.
Collaborative Teams: I thrive in organizations that value collaboration, knowledge sharing, and constructive code reviews. I believe the best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives and transparent communication.
Problem-Solving Challenges: I'm drawn to complex technical challenges that require innovative approaches. Projects that push boundaries and require creative problem-solving keep me engaged and motivated.
Work-Life Balance: I value a healthy balance between professional commitment and personal time. Flexibility in working arrangements helps me maintain productivity while avoiding burnout.
Clear Project Vision: I perform best when working on projects with well-defined goals and a clear understanding of how they provide value to end-users.
I prefer to avoid environments that resist adopting modern practices or are exclusively tied to legacy systems without a modernization roadmap."

.net,"Full-Stack .NET Developer with over 3.5 years of professional experience working on diverse projects, mainly in the e-commerce domain.
At Evinent GmbH (June 2023 – Present), I work on a high-traffic e-commerce platform serving approximately 3 million monthly users. My role involves implementing a wide range of features across the full stack, developing new functionalities for content managers, optimizing existing code, and contributing to various integration projects with banking systems, delivery services, and other e-commerce platforms.
During my time at Global Logic (November 2022 – April 2023), I participated in a .NET internship where I refined my skills by working on a complex microservices project utilizing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture. This experience deepened my understanding of best practices and advanced design approaches.
As a Freelance .NET Developer (September 2020 – May 2023), I worked on various small-scale projects, collaborating closely with clients to deliver customized solutions. Notable projects include:
Inventory Management System for a Small Retailer (8 months): Developed the backend using ASP.NET MVC, C#, and Entity Framework. Responsibilities included database design, implementing functionalities like stock tracking, supplier management, and sales reporting, ensuring data integrity and security, and optimizing queries for performance.
E-shop Website Redesign (4 months): Participated in the redesign of an e-commerce website for a small business using the ASP.NET MVC framework. Handled both frontend and backend development, improved the user interface with responsive design, and refactored code for better maintainability.
I am now seeking opportunities to further grow professionally, leveraging my experience to contribute to challenging projects and advance my skills in software development.
One of my most notable achievements in my current role include:
1. Data Transfer Optimization:
I participated in migrating API and Redis cache from JSON to Protobuf, reducing data transfer between the API and the website and decreasing cache storage requirements by up to 40%. This optimization significantly improved system performance and reduced server load.
2. System Performance Enhancements:
I optimized various aspects of the application to enhance efficiency and performance. For example, I reduced the time it takes to save an entity by a factor of five. This was one of many tasks where I improved code and database and network operations across the system.
3. Complex Third-Party Integrations:
I implemented multiple integration projects with banking systems, delivery services, and other e-commerce platforms. These projects were complex and required work across the full stack, involving backend development, API integration, and frontend adjustments. These integrations expanded the platform's capabilities and provided users with a more seamless and comprehensive experience."

.net,"I'm a full-stack software engineer with almost 3 years of commercial software development experience.
I got my first job and project in IT at the age of 18, and all this time I have continued to grow and learn software development.
I have successful experience in developing desktop and web applications, interacting with small and large teams, and learning new technologies.
My main technologies are .NET and Angular Framework, which I have used with monolithic and microservice architectures. My experience helps me to design systems using development principles and design patterns.
More about my skills and expirience you can find in my CV, on my Linkedin page, or just simply contact me :)
Participated in writing business logic of the application and covered it with tests
• Participated in the expansion of the user interface and offered ideas which in result improved interface of
application and user expirience.
• Data schema development and integration with third-party services
• Optimized existing processes and parts in the application, created new parts of the application
• Grew from Junior to Middle specialist
• Both projects which I was involved in were done using .NET and Angular as core technologies, the first
project was also done using PostgreSQL for DB and had a monolithic architecture. The second project used
SQL Server for the DB (with Redgate products for versioning changes) and had a microservice architecture.
I was a part of big team on second project for 2 years, project was in banking/payments field
I'm looking for an interesting project, ideally long term. I want to participate in the development and growth of the project :)"
.net,"I`ve been working on a project with a dozen integrations inside and outside the domain this year. One part of it is a serverless app to manage upgrades/patches of hardware on many vehicles, which is hosted on Azure utilising it in the best way, keeping in mind the solution cost. Another part is an intensive reporting API that utilezes the power of GRPC to be generated dynamically based on the client database state. My main focus was implementing the core domain for handling such updates, and I was working on an automation tool for API building to speed up the development of API in an idempotent way :)
Last year I worked on the Belgium construction app which covered huge NASA projects. My main duty was to split the 15+ years old desktop app with broken architecture and mixed on-premise/cloud infrastructure into a clean and modular monolith as a set of APIs, which later should be moved to Kubernetes.
Also, I have experience in building enterprise projects of different sizes, scales, and stacks of technologies.
Clear back-end, full-stack web using Angular 2+, and full-stack desktop development using WPF.
I managed to change the design approach for back-end services from old-fashioned monolith to microservices based on DDD/CQRS with Clean Architecture achieving business goals and cleaning the solution to improve service stability, performance, and scaling.
I have been working on transforming the desktop monolith to a modular monolith to prepare the migration from the on-premises back-end with the desktop client to Azure SAAS with further web development.
I would like to work in an environment of people who are proactive and willing to take responsibility for the decisions they make."

the system, they may become so.
Besides, I was asked to help the trainee with onboarding and with any questions he may have.

.net,"While studying at the university, I took part in the development of two projects for IT companies:
Project for the GlobalLogic company (March 2023 - June 2023). It consisted of creating a cross-platform application that, based on the selected bomb, its specified power, and the selected weather, would model the radius of destruction on a world map. Depending on the location and force of the explosion, the coordinates of shelters located within the specified circle of destruction were downloaded from the database. In the team, I was the developer of the client side of the application and
performed the following tasks: connecting to the server side of the application, connecting the map, implementing the ability to move around the map, scaling the map, locating the explosion marker, placing shelters and providing information about potential injured and dead.
Project for the Skiftech company (October 2023 - May 2024). It consisted of creating a web application for calculating the data transmission area. Based on the input data, the linear dimensions of the cross-section of the data transmission area were calculated, after which a 3D
model of the radiation beam was modeled, which allowed to visually see the shape of the beam and understand whether such a laser is suitable for a particular task. This application included registration, the ability to correct the data of the created account, and the ability to create and save templates of calculated data, as well as download them in the “markdown” format. In the team, I had the role of developing the 3D model and the backend part of the application."

.net,"I have about 1.5 year of commercial experience in the roles of .NET+Angular full stack developer and .NET backend developer in two outsource companies with more then 5 active projects I've been working with. Since my teams were little in both companies, my tasks were wide ranged (e.g. designing landing with bootstrap, writing a lot of code on BE, writing integration tests, FE coding, debugging issues and solving problems on both sides (sometimes at once), a lot of communication with team members,  I even did some DevOps job).
That's not all, also I have a lot of math knowledges and developed good logical skills with 4 years of studying at Computer Science speciality in my uni  (I have Bachelor Degree).
Here's my primary skills:
I'm good at writing C# code since it is my primary PL, but also can read and analyse code written in other languages (JS/TS, python, C++, etc.)
ASP .NET CORE WebAPI/MVC (Primary API),
Relational databases(msSQL, mySQL, postgre) with sql

Some Azure Cloud services (app
deployment, Blob storage, SQL DBs, pipelines)

Docker, Postman, Swagger specification
External accounting (QuickBooks),
Message queue: MQTT (publisher/subscriber),
WebSockets: SignalR
And maybe other stuff I already forgot about ).
Also, I'm interested in micro services cause i haven't seen this architecture (used to work with 3 layers), I am always ready to try new technologies even though I haven't tried it yet. I'm very open-minded, kinda funny, willing to grow, so...
I have some tasks I'm really proud of, they were hard and challenging enough, to count them as my goals on previous jobs. In my opinion, the more theoretical is problem, the more interesting is to solve it.
I look forward to opportunity to work with friendly team on growing project with clean architecture and code convention from it's very beginning, however I also understand that such expectations may also be far from reality on real projects.
From a practical perspective, I expect the following from my future job: a salary tied to the dollar, the option for remote work, and, if it's part-time with an hourly rate, a constant flow of tasks. Otherwise, I would expect compensation in cases where tasks are unavailable for more than 35% of the working time.

As a system administrator, I was responsible for installing and configuring software, monitoring and optimizing system performance. I effectively responded to technical failures and malfunctions, keeping the infrastructure running smoothly. My work also included maintaining documentation of system processes and providing advice to users on IT issues. Working as a system administrator in a new company, I first of all learned the new system as much as I could with the help of introductory courses and colleagues. I started by working with Recourse Inventory. Here I developed my skills in creating SQL scripts, as well as knowledge of how and what phone calls do to make a connection. Later, I participated in several projects as the entire system started to migrate to a new one, and the main idea behind this for me was to learn the structure of the company. The structure was not only about IT, but also about management and, I think, human-centeredness

I am very comfortable with Linux environment and different scripting languages such as Python and bash.
I have also good exposure to UI development and comfortable with HTML CSS and JS.
On the deployment side, I have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and Distributed Systems. My recent projects have involved building event-based distributed systems, which were containerized with Docker and efficiently managed using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to handle varying API traffic loads.
Additionally, I've successfully worked with Azure Distributed Redis Cache and leveraged Azure Service Bus, encompassing Azure Queues and Topics, in conjunction with NService Bus to empower event-driven applications.
I thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions.

.net,"I worked as a WPF .NET developer on my first commercial project. This product was a next-generation data analysis solution for life sciences. In this project, I was developing new controls that display a large amount of data, dynamic controls that change that data, and implementing algorithms that import and export that data. Window Wizards help scientists configure what type of research they will do. Also, I have developed the user roles feature, and different roles have access to various application features. A security system that uses Windows API to lock the application if the user has not interacted with the system.
After that, I had several small WPF, UWP, and Xamarim.Forms projects. One of them was an application running on a Windows tablet. It connected via Bluetooth to the Smart Wrench System to control remote bolt tightening. I have developed various UI controls to see and control bolt tightening.
One year, I dedicated myself to projects where my primary responsibility was translating VisualBasic code to C# code. We have developed a WPF application moving code from the old Visual Basic. These projects worked with various math data, so we needed to write Unit Tests.
After developing Desktop applications, I decided to move to the web. I started working on an electricity billing system that informs customers about their electricity consumption and allows them to pay bills. My primary responsibility was to create a web application to create a system for automatic billing to pay for electricity. Users could log into the app and set up automatic payments by linking their smart meter and providing their payment details. I was fully responsible for Frontend (Angular, Bootstrap) and partially for Backend (.NET Core, MS SQL).
I have been working for several years for a retail company called Adorama. My responsibilities are developing, maintaining, supporting, and enhancing those websites' functionality.

I am using Elastic and NewRelic to monitor different activities to find problems in the system.
While working with Desktop Applications, I learned much about Windows API and AppDomain. I created an application that automatically created and used AppDomains. Therefore, every AppDomain was an isolated app with its resources; even static classes were isolated.
After moving to the web, I quickly learned how to develop a complete web application and create beautiful pages.
Working with an extensive code database, understanding it, and maintaining it is not easy, but I am doing well.
I would say that I am open to learning new, exciting technologies, and I will be able to understand them quickly

.net,"For the past year, I’ve been working at Univisia on the Harrods project. I implemented a discount band system, embedded Power BI dashboards for real-time analytics, worked on integrating SAP into the system, and developed a bulk order upload feature. Additionally, I have three years of experience at SoftServe as a FullStack Developer (.Net and React), also I was writing code using Elixir programming language. Furthermore, I worked on a healthcare project at WiserBrand, where the main goal was to implement an EDI parser to manage various insurance rules across the USA.
Besides my enterprise experience, I've been involved in mentoring children through the CoderDojo project and served as a member of the human resources team at AIESEC.
During my tenure at SoftServe, I contributed to the development of gas and oil projects. The first project is a substantial undertaking involving microservices on the .Net Framework and .Net Core for the backend. On the frontend side, we employed React and some parts of Angular, and there was significant involvement with SQL (SQL Server) components such as stored procedures, functions, and views.
The second project was built with Elixir for the backend and React for the frontend. Additionally, we implemented a couple of APIs and Azure Functions built on .Net 5 (later migrated to .Net 6). Elastic search was employed for this project, along with Postgresql.
In my third project, I worked as a Full-Stack Engineer at WiserBrand company on a healthcare platform  connecting insurance companies and end customers from. I implemented EDI parsers for managing data on bills, insurance companies, and clients, and developed custom authorization pages using AWS Cognito and Lambdas. I also worked on a rules engine for data validation and built React pages.
In my last project, I worked as a Full-Stack Engineer at Univisia on the Harrods luxury e-commerce platform. I played a crucial role in implementing a discount band system to provide dynamic pricing based on customer tiers. Additionally, I embedded Power BI dashboards into the platform to offer real-time analytics, giving the business valuable insights into sales, customer behavior, and inventory. I also integrated SAP authentication to streamline secure user login and authorization processes. I developed a bulk order upload feature using React and .NET, enabling customers to efficiently upload large quantities of products."

• Overhauling of a CRM system
Imagine a web application (CRM) working with multiple databases, i.e. each corporate client has its own database instance. The schema is the same across all the DBs but the data is, apparently, unique. Historically, the application wasn't tailored for that architecture, so every new client required a new DB and application instances.
It started creating major problems when the number of clients was reaching a hundred. So, eventually, releasing new functionality or a bug fix, incurred re-deploying some 100 application instances.
I was told to revisit the way the app worked to get rid of the multiple-instances approach, i.e. there should be only one single instance that's capable of working with the multiple databases. In fact, it was an overhaul of many ""plumbing"" facilities such as DB access, file storage, client app settings, and console apps packaged with the main web app.
Having been implemented and tested, the solution went to production in 2018 and has been working since then without any issues. After all, the developer that was in charge of deployments said, 'Dmitry deserves a medal' :)
• Learning new technologies & concepts moving to .NET Core
Having worked for quite a few years with the old-style .NET Framework solutions (mainly Web Forms, WCF, .NET 4.x), with almost no commercial experience in more modern technologies, I managed to move into the .NET Core stack. In a short space of time, I grasped the technology and learned how it works with the cloud.
As a result, I was able to join the team at my new job and participate in the development of a brand-new web project (.NET Core 6, AWS, GraphQL) as a backend developer. The project was successfully finished and has been live since late 2022.
• Working remotely since 2009
I've been working remotely for more than 10 years now, since before it started to be a normal thing. During that time I've gained a profound experience in all things remote, whether it's communicating with local/overseas clients and colleagues, arranging my working schedule or coping with distractions.
I seek a long-term partnership where I can play a senior technical role applying my experience to develop well-written and robust IT solutions. I really like hands-on coding which is what I mainly do these days, however, I want to be involved in solving higher level problems including software architecture and how different systems integrate with each other. Being a team player, I am happy to mentor junior members to help them learn the ropes and improve their skills."
