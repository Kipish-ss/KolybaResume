software engineer,"I'm Senior Software Engineer with hands-on experience in software development and software architecture. I have experience in several domains: fintech, insurance, and transportation. Mostly I'm responsible for the backend. I've been working in companies of different sizes, so I have a good understanding of SDLC (from gathering requirements to the support phase), how to communicate with stakeholders and teams, and how to build good processes.
As a part of my daily responsibilities, I'm involved in the architecture design and implementation of the solutions, and code reviews.
Made a refactoring of application that helped reduced api calls withing internal service to service communication. Improved database schema that helped us to reduce response time in 20%,
Created a plan that improved code coverage up to 75% using Unit, Integration, Load, Acceptance testing using different tools (k6, xunit/nunit, Specflow, etc) Made refactoring the system that helped us to increase scalability and availability.
The Projects are based on modern technologies.
Preferred technologies/approaches on the project:
DDD, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Services, ELK, .Net 5+, ASP.NET Core, Microservices, CQRS, Event Sourcing, SOLID, GOF, OOD, CI/CD"
software engineer,"I’ve spent the last few years building, fixing, and scaling real-world systems - from high-load backends to Electron desktop apps and AI-integrated platforms. I don’t just ship features - I take ownership of the whole thing: architecture, code quality, performance, and delivery.
At ProDrops, I rebuilt a broken tournament system from the ground up, cutting response times and boosting user session duration 5x. At The EXT Store, I implemented the frontend architecture for a cross-platform app, built a UI Kit from scratch, and helped steer product direction. With Basilicode, I integrated AI into a FinTech platform and led development on a psychology app, balancing technical complexity with clear delivery timelines.
I’ve led full-stack teams at AMC Bridge, contributed to critical performance fixes, and replaced clunky libraries with clean, fast internal ones. Earlier, I co-founded a studio, shipped MVPs under pressure, and freelanced across a bunch of domains - always learning, always delivering.
My go-to stack is TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, Electron, and PostgreSQL, but I’ve worked with everything from Python and Go to Lua and Rust. I’m solid on CI/CD, DevOps basics, and scaling challenges.
These days, I’m usually in a senior or lead role - writing solid code, mentoring teammates, and driving product delivery. While I’m deeply experienced in full-stack and web technologies, I’m also expanding my skills into lower-level programming - things like C/C++, embedded systems, and Rust - to round out my toolkit and better understand the layers beneath the platforms I build on.
- Rebuilt a major tournament system at ProDrops, fixing long-standing performance issues. The new version cut backend response times significantly and increased user session duration by 5x.
- Created a full UI Kit from scratch in just a few weeks at The EXT Store, replacing scattered, inconsistent code with a clean, reusable component system that sped up development across the team.
- Integrated AI features into a live FinTech platform at Basilicode, balancing complex ML outputs with a clean user experience. Also led development of a psychology app powered by GPT-based analysis.
- Replaced bloated Material UI with a custom internal library at AMC Bridge, reducing app build times and improving runtime performance. This change also made styling and component logic easier to reason about for the whole team.
- Delivered an MVP event app in 3 days during a high-pressure client engagement at BOBR.studio. Fixed bugs live while the app was in use - risky but successful, and the client was happy.
- Led a full-stack development team and coordinated with BAs, designers, and QAs to deliver on tight deadlines, while mentoring junior devs and handling complex technical decisions.
I want to work on things that matter - projects with real technical challenges, where good engineering makes a difference. Ideally, I’d like to be part of a small, sharp team where everyone takes ownership and the work isn’t buried under layers of bureaucracy.
I’m especially interested in systems that go beyond just UI - whether it’s backend-heavy, infrastructure, integrations with hardware, or anything with a bit of technical depth. I’m always up for learning something new, especially if it takes me closer to understanding how things work under the hood.
What I don’t want is to be stuck pushing tickets in a giant feature factory, or endlessly polishing frontend animations for yet another clone app. If I’m in, I’m all in - but only if the work’s worth doing."

software engineer,"I am an enthusiastic, skilled web developer with years of experience in developing innovative digital solutions. My background spans a myriad of different projects, which have turned out to show my capabilities in quality delivery at both ends: frontend and backend development.
In the previous position, I managed the full-cycle development of a large marketplace on auto parts using Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Node.js. There was a need to develop a dynamic UI with payment systems integration and further automation of processes to make operations more efficient. I was responsible for data import/export functionality and integration with third-party services like TecDoc.
One of the biggest projects was to develop a web site for payment of gas consumption with millions of users every month. It designed and implemented the next features: Personalized Dashboards, Payment Processing, Automated Reminders. The role required maximum focus on the user experience and good communication to address complex requirements and present a user-friendly platform.
One of the key strengths and skills is :
Technical Knowledge: I know Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, and SQL to their core. This enables me to develop robust applications that give users the best experience.
Problem-solving: Such complex problems related to system integration and automation of the same for enhanced functionality and efficiency can be resolved.
Project Management: Managed the whole project lifecycle from an idea to the implementation of UI/UX design, server-side development, and payment systems.
Communication: The ability to communicate with teams and all those involved in a project in such a way that it will obviously eliminate any kind of misunderstanding about the delivery of the project goals.
Adaptability: My record in quickly adapting new technologies and requirements of various projects shows my versatility in different areas of web development projects.
I am confident that my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and project management experience will make me instrumental in each role to provide innovative web development solutions and undertake projects efficiently.

software engineer,"Professional Background
My career began as a web developer in an era before ECMAScript gained popularity. For over four years, I primarily utilized vanilla JavaScript and JQuery, Webpack and Sass to create engaging web UI/UX designs. During this time, I recognized the rising prominence of React.js and decided to pivot my focus towards reactive development.
.
.
For the next 3 years, I specialized in building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Server-Side Rendered SPAs (SSR-SPAs) using React.js and Next.js. While fulfilling, this phase involved complex challenges and significant hustle.
.
.
Subsequently, I transitioned to React Native, which enabled me to explore developing cross-platform mobile applications by leveraging my existing JavaScript skills and a similar technology stack. This experience has been both exciting and rewarding for the last four years.
.
.
After spending several years in this field, I decided to expand my horizons by adopting the native iOS development stack (Swift, with focus on SwiftUI) and planning to pursue native Android development as well(Kotlin).
Summary
Experienced Software Engineer skilled in building scalable and high-performance web and mobile applications, focusing on intuitive user experiences (UX) and mobile-friendly user interfaces (UI).
As I seek new opportunities, I am looking for a role that provides:
Clear Team Hierarchy: A well-defined organizational structure that fosters effective communication and collaboration among team members, enabling me to understand my responsibilities and the pathways for career growth.
