software engineer,"I am working for 3 years as a software engineer on various projects for a foreign customer involved into creating a solution to enable customers (primarly Law and Business) to create their own templates, forms etc. to fill out. I was working on a Cloud solution that would run these artifacts, WinForms-based Word add-in that is used to create them and also e-commerce website for authors, which want to sell these templates.
For the web projects I have been creating business-logic APIs, introducing systems such as global and context-senstivie error handling mechansims, Single-Sign On, localization. There was also a project that I built from scratch, which enabled our customers to invoke some admin actions such as managing their users, running CRON tasks, watching statistics etc. I have also took part in creating CRON and CI/CD tasks based on both .NET CLI apps and PowerShell scripts. One of these projects used to utilize WCF, jQuery, old ASP.NET, plain SQL stack and I helped updating it to ASP.NET Core, Vue, Entity Framework Core combination, which drasticallly increased our efficiency in introducing new features as well as onboarding new teammates.
As for the Word add-in project, the company wanted to consolidate Web and add-ins frontends and significantly ovehaul it's visual appearance, therefore? I was asked to replace the most vital parts of this application with WebView frontend making it work like an Electron app. There I mainly operated on the frontend part, organizing the communication between WebView and C# layers, writing view-scoped logic and creating forms with Vue for users to author their own templates.
I also have some side experience with PHP-based CMS (WordPress, OpenCart): I fixed some parts of commercial website for that aforementioned company and also completed freelance orders of creating websites for businesses, which were providing heating and made sushi.
I would like to develop myself in a more sophisticated architectural solutions, which would involve such techniques as Clean Architecture, CQRS, ES, DDD etc. I am testing these in my pet-project, but want to see how masters adapt these into their applications.
During my commercial career I have done a lot of tasks, but I am most proud of these ones:
* I have globally updated customer's old techonology stack to a new one: WCF to REST, ADO.NET to EntityFramework/Dapper (for niche cases), jQuery-driven frontend to Vue + BootstrapVue etc.
* I have introduced a range of global mechanisms like context-sensitive/global error handling, localization, handling of multiple concurrent login sessions etc.
* I have composed an architecture for Word add-in, which was utilizing WebView: the way it communicates with C# backend, reuses similar forms, processes UI templates and so on.
* I have integrated our application with SSO backed by identity provider PingIdentity via SAML protocol.
* I have created a system to process our clients' on-premises filesystems. It consisted of C# tasks like cleaning up unnecessary log files, assembling cache-like artefacts etc, which were run via Task Scheduler.
Also, some of my pet-projects feature stuff like:
* Real-time updating of booking statuses via SignalR.
* Integration with payment gateway LiqPay.
I am primarly looking for developing Web systems, in which I would mainly work on the backend part, but I also definitely do not mind working on a Desktop app, tools development or creating rather simple frontends. Ideally, I would like to gain experience with projects that utilize advanced architectural patterns and have a dive into functional programming paradigm."

My first team was using scrum, besides development itself I was participating in PI planning, backlog refinement, demo and retro sessions. After delivering the majority of planned features the teams have been reorganized and I've been suggested to join a really interesting one - the team that was created for delivering non-planned features that are requested from business ""on the run"" using kanban. We had to adjust quickly to continuously changing requirements and task priorities, release features weekly, communicate directly with business representatives and external teams (designers, adobe analytics team, qa team for additional testing capacity). After some time I also started doing some management work on team lead's days off: holding daily meetings/retros/refinements, assisting less experienced team members with technical solutions, clarifying requirements and coordinating releases. I also did interviewing and mentoring for new developers.
I have developed hundreds of high quality features, participating in every step from planning to prod deployment.
I have successfully coordinated numerous releases, overseeing the entire process from development and testing to deployment in production. Throughout each project, I consistently aim to enhance the overall quality by proposing innovative technical solutions, addressing technical debt, and focusing on performance optimizations.

software engineer,"Java Software Engineer with around 5 years of experience designing and developing various aspects of web applications using Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Cloud services (AWS), Git, and Agile/Scrum methodologies. Proficient at learning new technologies, designing modules, and integrating external APIs, utilizing creative problem solving and unit testing to increase functionality and performance. Expertise in data manipulation and database optimization, writing advanced queries and stored procedures. I have experienced the transformative power of AI, enhancing our services with improved
efficiency, accuracy, and innovative solutions."
software engineer,"I'm an ML engineer with Machine Learning and infrastructure skills (I have Kubernetes certification, for example).
I have 12+ years of experience in IT in different roles: DevOps engineer, Python Back-end engineer, ML engineer, and Technical Lead. Such broad experience allows me to speak the same language with other engineers and understand them, which is very important while collaborating with a team or a company. As an ML engineer, I'm able to not only train models in Jupyter Notebook but also know how to convert business goals into technical tasks, and design, and build the whole production system with ML models and surrounding infrastructure. Besides that, I have strong math and statistical background, and terms like ""Central Limit Theorem"", ""p-value"", and ""probability distribution"" wouldn't scare me at all.
I designed and implemented the RAG part of a platform for creating AI assistants: knowledge indexing and retrieval strategy, text embeddings, performance evaluation of the RAG application, etc.
I created a new version of a model for personalized recommendations in the Wix App market from scratch. We had a significant increase in installations (+40%) from the Rec4U widget after releasing the new model.
In 2019 I was invited to the newly assembled team of ML engineers in a startup. Our task was to automate a big part of the routine work that usually is done by data analysts. No one in our team had experience in the domain by that time, and we had to start the project entirely from scratch. I led the team through all stages of a project: starting from domain knowledge transfer and first research till integration of models' inference with data analysis tool and supporting models on production. As a result, the time spent by analysts doing their regular work decreased three times. As a side effect, the quality of analysts' work significantly improved because they started focusing on important data patterns omitting the most routing and tedious part of their work.
The most important thing for me is the people, i.e., the coworkers and an interesting product. I want to work in a team of passionate ML practitioners and software engineers who are cheerful, mature, and love their work — people who have outstanding experience and who love to share it with others and support others.
The ideal management, for me, is clear, transparent, with common sense in the first place, without micro-management, time tracking, etc. I like it when managers treat people as mature adult individuals and assess their work by the results.
Ideally, I expect to have an opportunity with all the above-mentioned and where my broad experience is needed."

software engineer,"I'm Senior Software Engineer with hands-on experience in software development and software architecture. I have experience in several domains: fintech, insurance, and transportation. Mostly I'm responsible for the backend. I've been working in companies of different sizes, so I have a good understanding of SDLC (from gathering requirements to the support phase), how to communicate with stakeholders and teams, and how to build good processes.

software engineer,"I’ve spent the last few years building, fixing, and scaling real-world systems - from high-load backends to Electron desktop apps and AI-integrated platforms. I don’t just ship features - I take ownership of the whole thing: architecture, code quality, performance, and delivery.
At ProDrops, I rebuilt a broken tournament system from the ground up, cutting response times and boosting user session duration 5x. At The EXT Store, I implemented the frontend architecture for a cross-platform app, built a UI Kit from scratch, and helped steer product direction. With Basilicode, I integrated AI into a FinTech platform and led development on a psychology app, balancing technical complexity with clear delivery timelines.
I’ve led full-stack teams at AMC Bridge, contributed to critical performance fixes, and replaced clunky libraries with clean, fast internal ones. Earlier, I co-founded a studio, shipped MVPs under pressure, and freelanced across a bunch of domains - always learning, always delivering.
My go-to stack is TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, Electron, and PostgreSQL, but I’ve worked with everything from Python and Go to Lua and Rust. I’m solid on CI/CD, DevOps basics, and scaling challenges.
These days, I’m usually in a senior or lead role - writing solid code, mentoring teammates, and driving product delivery. While I’m deeply experienced in full-stack and web technologies, I’m also expanding my skills into lower-level programming - things like C/C++, embedded systems, and Rust - to round out my toolkit and better understand the layers beneath the platforms I build on.
- Rebuilt a major tournament system at ProDrops, fixing long-standing performance issues. The new version cut backend response times significantly and increased user session duration by 5x.
- Created a full UI Kit from scratch in just a few weeks at The EXT Store, replacing scattered, inconsistent code with a clean, reusable component system that sped up development across the team.
- Integrated AI features into a live FinTech platform at Basilicode, balancing complex ML outputs with a clean user experience. Also led development of a psychology app powered by GPT-based analysis.
- Replaced bloated Material UI with a custom internal library at AMC Bridge, reducing app build times and improving runtime performance. This change also made styling and component logic easier to reason about for the whole team.
- Delivered an MVP event app in 3 days during a high-pressure client engagement at BOBR.studio. Fixed bugs live while the app was in use - risky but successful, and the client was happy.
- Led a full-stack development team and coordinated with BAs, designers, and QAs to deliver on tight deadlines, while mentoring junior devs and handling complex technical decisions.
I want to work on things that matter - projects with real technical challenges, where good engineering makes a difference. Ideally, I’d like to be part of a small, sharp team where everyone takes ownership and the work isn’t buried under layers of bureaucracy.
I’m especially interested in systems that go beyond just UI - whether it’s backend-heavy, infrastructure, integrations with hardware, or anything with a bit of technical depth. I’m always up for learning something new, especially if it takes me closer to understanding how things work under the hood.
What I don’t want is to be stuck pushing tickets in a giant feature factory, or endlessly polishing frontend animations for yet another clone app. If I’m in, I’m all in - but only if the work’s worth doing."

software engineer,"Professional Background
My career began as a web developer in an era before ECMAScript gained popularity. For over four years, I primarily utilized vanilla JavaScript and JQuery, Webpack and Sass to create engaging web UI/UX designs. During this time, I recognized the rising prominence of React.js and decided to pivot my focus towards reactive development.
.
.
For the next 3 years, I specialized in building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Server-Side Rendered SPAs (SSR-SPAs) using React.js and Next.js. While fulfilling, this phase involved complex challenges and significant hustle.
.
.
Subsequently, I transitioned to React Native, which enabled me to explore developing cross-platform mobile applications by leveraging my existing JavaScript skills and a similar technology stack. This experience has been both exciting and rewarding for the last four years.
.
.
After spending several years in this field, I decided to expand my horizons by adopting the native iOS development stack (Swift, with focus on SwiftUI) and planning to pursue native Android development as well(Kotlin).

- Reduced technical debt in the various Java-based projects by organizing and refactoring project structure.
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of a large codebase to map data flow between
[application itself, Relational aka SQL database and a document-based database] in a modular
application. The task involved identifying field mappings between SQL database table columns and document-oriented NoSQL database collection document fields, overcoming challenges due to separate database query modules. Delivered comprehensive mapping documentation in Google Sheets, serving as a crucial reference for developers. This effort streamlined cross-database data handling and established a foundation for efficient data lookup. It is a predevelopment investment that gives great returns.
- Implemented a solution to bridge data consistency between a legacy SQL-based database and a cloud-native document-oriented NoSQL database. The challenge involved eliminating ID generation discrepancies. Analyzed the data flow for profile creation and updates to ensure proper mapping and synchronization of entities. Delivered an efficient mechanism to fetch and align IDs between systems.
This solution enabled end users (agents) to perform seamless scenarios across databases and preserve data integrity. Thus, the system allows simple business logic scenarios, which boosts agent performance.
Tech details: I used the HashMap-based algorithm, which is relatively easy to grasp and efficient enough to balance the SIMPLICITY vs EFFICIENCY trade-off. Like it was such options to make:
a) Trie (aka prefix tree) data structure-based algorithm (super-efficient but not that simple).
b) Double `for` loop. Simple but not that efficient.
c) HashMap solution. Simple and efficient. The chosen one.
- I invested significantly in refactoring a Java-based application, eliminating numerous code duplications across five key endpoints (data read and write). This effort not only significantly reduced the codebase size but also enhanced maintainability and readability, making the application more efficient and easier to extend.
- Performed a comprehensive analysis of a significant, poorly written legacy Java codebase with duplicates, redundancies, and inefficiencies. Created extensive documentation in Confluence to detail critical aspects
Purposeful work. I want to build real systems, not throwaway code. Code that runs in production, solves real problems, and stays maintainable.
Clear expectations. I expect well-defined goals, clarity around responsibilities, and honest feedback on performance and growth.
Time to think. I want space for deep work — fewer meetings, more focus time. Let me design, reason, refactor, and actually manage clean code.
Good engineers around me. I want to learn from strong developers, and I want my voice to be heard in design and code reviews.
Respect for engineering. I expect deadlines to be balanced with quality. No “just make it work.” No “we’ll fix it later” culture.
Technical challenges. I want to work on systems where things like data consistency, fault tolerance, modular design, and performance actually matter.
Career growth, not career stalling. I expect support in moving toward a senior role — through responsibility, feedback, and access to meaningful work"

I also played a role in configuring and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
I am eager to join a team that values continuous improvement, embraces new ideas, and is passionate about the projects they work on. I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the success of the team
Technologies I have experience with: Java, Spring, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hibernate, myBatis, Grafana, Kafka, AWS (ECS, EKS, MariaDB, SQS, MSK), Docker, k8s, Helm, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Harness)
I have implemented a library which goal was to run integration tests. We needed it because the used CI tool (Harness) did not support using Docker correctly due to implementation details. So we had environment difference while running integration tests locally and in Harness. Locally you had an access to the docker socket and we could start Docker containers in code, while in Harness containers should have been started ""in background"" before the actual build. The library could check the running environment and operate containers in code if needed
Also I performed the CI tool migration from Jenkins to Harness with help of a devops team. It helped me a lot with understanding how CI/CD process works in practice
I’m always willing to participate in implementing bright and interesting ideas. I like uncovering and mastering new skills, and I believe that this characteristic along with my desire to give as many quality results as possible will bring considerable value to your company

Next 3 years I worked in the automotive domain on rendering engine and map display. Feature development, support, maintenance, and learning some graphics programming.
Worked as a part of a client’s team, in a small local team, and in big teams.
QNX, Android, OpenGL, Metal API, OpenGL -> metal API porting
7 months in game development. My main job was to port game from working on PS5 to squeeze 60 FPS on PS4 in UE4 4.25
As of Spring 2021 working on another OpenGL -> Metal API render engine migration.
I’m pretty flexible in learning new things, without having much of OpenGL experience I was feeling pretty well as a generalist C+ developer working on rendering and learning OpenGL on the go.
I’m always trying to improve things in the project even though sometimes it is not being accepted like when I improved an algorithm to work 3.5 times faster and the entire pipeline run shrunk from 20 hours to about 6 + this enabled using GPU for calculation instead of expensive Intel Xeon. It was not accepted just because it was not passing some tests with hardcoded values. Though it is known that complex floating points algorithms can diverge with different implementations just because of floating-point arithmetics error on CPU { (a+b)+c != a+(b+c) }.
Not some legacy project.

software engineer,"In my previous roles, I have worked extensively on a range of projects, taking ownership of both backend and frontend development. I have significant experience in transitioning a large-scale payment gateway infrastructure from PHP to a Java-based microservice architecture, which involved managing complex migrations, ensuring seamless integration, and maintaining security and performance standards.
During this project, I worked primarily with technologies such as Java, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and OAuth 2 for secure authentication. My role was not only to write clean, maintainable code but also to collaborate with cross-functional teams, engage in technical discussions, and handle the architecture of microservices.
In other projects, I have worked with technologies like JavaScript, PHP, and REST APIs, developing dynamic web applications with real-time capabilities. I integrated various payment gateway APIs, optimized database performance, and ensured systems were scalable and maintainable. For the front end, I utilized JavaScript frameworks and libraries to enhance user experience and streamline application functionality.
As a Lead Developer, I also took part in mentoring junior developers, guiding them through coding challenges, and fostering a collaborative team environment. I’ve led daily stand-ups, conducted code reviews, and implemented agile practices to ensure smooth project progression. I particularly focused on automating testing processes to ensure quality, as well as optimizing project timelines.
In terms of improvements, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge of emerging technologies, especially in cloud computing and advanced microservices orchestration. I’m also interested in exploring more efficient CI/CD pipelines to enhance deployment processes and further improve team productivity. Additionally, I am keen on deepening my skills in data analysis tools and platforms like Power BI to extend my expertise in making data-driven decisions for system enhancements.
This combination of experience, leadership, and constant learning allows me to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions while ensuring that the team remains motivated and efficient in meeting deadlines and expectations."
software engineer,"One of my most recent projects is BetaCompass - a UK-based web platform where users can search for and review apartments they've previously lived in. Inspired by Reddit's nested comment model, I implemented a reply system where users can respond to reviews in a threaded manner. For authentication, I integrated Google OAuth alongside traditional email/password login with two-factor authentication. On the backend, I optimized database queries by avoiding inefficient skip/limit pagination and instead using last_seen_id techniques with proper indexing to speed up reads. The application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance behind an Nginx reverse proxy for performance, and I’ve set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for streamlined deployments.

software engineer,"Some recent projects:
At DxO Labs, I developed image editors for desktop platforms (Windows & macOS). Implemented new features provided by image processing engine into UI using Qt. Although we had dedicated UX designers, sometimes I proposed applicable solutions based on experience with actual application. Assisted in resolving user issues reported through the support team.
At Logitech, I worked on desktop application working with video cameras. Stack - Windows/macOS, Visual Studio/XCode, C++/AWS SDK/curl. Also participated in troubleshooting sessions with foreign customers.
At Wargaming, created server-side C++ SDK for game developers. SDK was generated based on OpenAPI specification. I participated in architecture discussion, then implemented some parts of SDK manually (like networking core, logging, initialization, error handling), and the other part of SDK was generated automatically. Generator templates and generator itself was also written by me. First generator was written using Qt, then rewritten using Python templates. Then SDK was ported on Unreal Engine.
I worked on many projects using C++/Qt, that is my main specialization. Also have some side experience with Unreal Engine, blockchain and neural networks. Embedded experience is limited to hobby projects working with Arduino and C.
My Qt experience can be seen in issues reported in their bug-tracker.
In projects which I participate, I usually introduce some general improvements like ease of debugging or proposals about fixing bad UX design. C++ development is still my main responsibility, but that side work helps the entire team.
I don't like pure fintech apps, because it's boring and usually involves a lot of low-level optimizations. Didn't work with mobile development except porting Qt apps on Android."

Known for exceptional problem-solving skills and a commitment to driving success in dynamic, forward-thinking tech environments
I worked on an IoT project where .NET applications were deployed on microcontrollers. One of the main challenges was the lack of an automated deployment process, which required manual steps to build, flash, and test the software. This process took from 20 minutes to 1 hour per deployment, which significantly slowed down development and debugging cycles.
To address this, I introduced an automated deployment pipeline, replacing the manual workflow. I wrote scripts to handle the build process, flashing, and testing in a streamlined manner. Additionally, I optimized the workflow by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant steps and minimize deployment overhead.
As a result, the deployment time was reduced up to 2 minutes, greatly improving developer efficiency and allowing for faster debugging and testing. This automation significantly enhanced the overall development workflow, making the process more reliable and scalable."

software engineer,"I'm a Software Engineer with over five years of experience. Since 2019, I have been working on a cloud-based service for remote monitoring and control of MODBUS protocol-based industrial equipment. The platform establishes connections with customer devices, reads and collects their data, provides dashboards and graphs for visualization, generates downloadable PDF reports, processes alerts configured by customers, sends SMS/email notifications, and offers many other features.
My work involves backend development with Rust and TypeScript, frontend development with React, and infrastructure management using Docker and GitHub Actions.
Key achievements on my current position:
- Implemented a new billing system: Each organization now has a balance from which funds are withdrawn daily based on service usage. Balance top-up is available via PayPal and Sense Bank acquiring.
- Quickly implemented integration with another SMS-sending gateway to prevent service interruption and customer loss when, at the beginning of the war, the previous provider stopped operating in Ukraine, causing customers to stop receiving notifications.
- Implemented a large number of features of different complexity (500+ pull requests on GitHub).
I am equally interested in working on a project being developed from scratch as well as on something that is in a support state. However, among my responsibilities I would like to see more often the implementation of server functionality."
software engineer,"An experienced Senior JavaScript/TypeScript Engineer with a consistent focus on building and maintaining scalable web platforms, back-end systems, and developer infrastructure in product-oriented environments. Actively contributed across the full development lifecycle—design, implementation, optimization, and maintenance—with a clear emphasis on performance and reliability.
Worked extensively with back-end stacks using Node.js, NestJS, and React, building APIs and integrating systems across distributed environments. On the front end, contributed to multiple React- and Angular-based projects, optimizing performance and modularity. Participated in projects in different domains.
Common responsibilities included implementing new features, resolving legacy inefficiencies, and improving delivery pipelines. Took part in cross-functional collaboration, code reviews, design reviews and sessions to elevate the quality and stability of software products. Technologies used include Kubernetes, Docker, Cosmos DB, ElasticSearch, Azure services, and various testing frameworks such as Jest.
Regularly engaged in improving engineering processes, validating requirements, and refining integration approaches with BPMN and CI/CD pipelines such as GitLabCI and Jenkins. Work often spanned both cloud-native systems and customer-facing solutions.
- Optimized Elasticsearch infrastructure, achieving $160k in annual cost savings without compromising SLA or search latency.
- Identified and resolved a long-standing production issue where 5% of client requests exceeded latency thresholds yet returned misleading success messages. Built monitoring tools that surfaced over 100k false positives monthly. The fix involved both application logic and CI/CD adjustments, improving reliability and transparency.
- Resolved a persistent issue in a legacy JavaScript codebase by incrementally reworking core logic, opting for structural improvements over temporary fixes. Previous attempts by external vendors had failed, and the successful outcome led to an extended client partnership.
- Reworked Dev–Ops collaboration by introducing clear deployment workflows and pre-deployment validation practices. This improved cross-team alignment and reduced deployment time from up to 2 days to a few hours.
- Spearheaded the delivery of a complex UI component over four weeks, working closely with a junior engineer, designer, and Product Owner. Shaped the delivery by refining user stories and clarifying scope early on. Implemented core logic using formal grammar for boolean expressions, while mentoring on UI development. The solution, now productized, enables dynamic filter logic in dashboards without backend involvement.
- Advocated for an outcome-oriented testing approach focused on end-to-end request/response validation. This fostered a natural separation of concerns between logic and side effects. Though adoption was voluntary, it resonated well, earning appreciation for improving test reliability and clarity."

software engineer,"I’m a hands-on software engineer who loves nothing more than watching a big idea grow from sketch to success. Over the last four years, I’ve specialized in building full-stack SaaS solutions that solve real problems—whether it’s a sleek front-end built with TypeScript, React, or Vue, or a rock-solid back-end supported by Node.js, Django, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB. Along the way, I’ve led projects that transitioned entire codebases and boosted annual revenue by more than a million dollars.
My favorite part of the job? Bridging the gap between what clients dream up and what end users actually need. Sometimes that means designing an intuitive UI in Figma or Adobe, or meticulously planning data flow so everything stays fast, responsive, and secure. I’ve gone deep into Redux, Redux-Saga, MobX, and testing with Jest—always aiming to push quality and keep feedback loops tight.
I’m not just here to write code. I’m here to collaborate closely with teams, customers, and stakeholders who want to bring fresh ideas to life. If you’re looking for someone who’s just as curious about new tech as they are about real-world impact, let’s connect.

software engineer,"In my 3+ years of work experience, I had the chance to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to grow both as a software engineer and a project lead. One of my most significant projects has been SkillBridge, an AI-powered learning platform aimed at helping high school students prepare for their national exams as well as class studies. In this role, I was deeply involved in both the front-end and back-end development. On the front-end, I used Flutter to create an intuitive, responsive interface that allowed users to access the platform and used React(Next.js) to build an admin dashboard that allows educators(teachers and top university students) to manage content, and make adjustments in real-time and for admins to monitor user engagement and other metrics. On the back-end, I integrated AI models such as GPT-4 and BERT to generate personalized content for students, making their learning experience more engaging and tailored to their needs.
Another project I’m proud of is AfroChat, a platform that provides professionals with access to multiple AI models and intelligent agents. This platform was unique because it required a modular architecture that could integrate several AI models while maintaining real-time internet access. I used React(Next.js), LangChain, FastAPI, and  Open source models from Hugging Face to create a system where users could interact with custom personas tailored to their professional needs and businesses. The platform also had a significant international reach, with users from over 80 countries benefiting from AI-driven tools to streamline their workflows.
Currently, I’m a project lead and full-stack (front-end heavy) developer, responsible for coding, guiding the team, managing timelines, and ensuring milestones are met. My focus is on creating seamless, intuitive user interfaces while maintaining backend performance and scalability. I collaborate closely with developers and designers to deliver solutions that meet both user and business needs.
In addition to enhancing my AI and ML skills, I want to keep advancing in front-end development, staying updated on the latest technologies and best practices to deliver top-notch user experiences. I'm particularly excited to explore integrating AI into front-end development, from AI-powered interfaces to personalized, intelligent design systems.

I am looking for projects related to high-load systems, distributed systems, FinTech, and other innovative areas"
software engineer,"In my current role as a Senior Software Engineer at Hilgrow, I'm mainly responsible for designing and implementing distributed microservices using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Kubernetes, which support millions of banking transactions daily. I have built RESTful and GraphQL APIs with Spring WebFlux and Dropwizard, ensuring high availability and seamless third-party integrations. Moreover, I have developed and optimized batch processing jobs using Spring Batch and Apache Spark, automating financial report generation and scheduled transactions.
One of the significant projects that I led was the development of a comprehensive healthcare management system. This system improved operational efficiency and patient care through several key features like patient record management, appointment scheduling, billing automation, secure prescription management, and automated notifications.
In terms of the technologies I've used, I have extensive hands-on experience in Java, Python, C#, .NET, React.js, Angular, Vue.js, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Batch, Spring Cloud, Hibernate, JPA, RESTful APIs, SOAP, GraphQL, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and many others.
I work closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers, security analysts, and DevOps engineers, to align technical solutions with business objectives and compliance requirements. I also actively mentor junior developers, fostering a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
As for what I want to improve, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge in emerging technologies and cloud architectures. I want to gain more experience working with serverless architectures and Big Data technologies. I'm also interested in improving my skills in machine learning and AI, as I believe they are the future of software development.
One of the projects I'm most proud of is the development of a microservices-based banking system at Hilgrow. This was a challenging task as it required designing a system that could handle millions of transactions daily. I used Java 17 and Spring Boot for writing the business logic and Spring Cloud for setting up the microservices architecture. We containerized these services with Docker and managed them using Kubernetes which ensured a modular, scalable, and maintainable system architecture.
For data storage and retrieval, we used PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. I worked on optimizing these databases by applying indexing, query optimization, and partitioning strategies. This ensured high-speed data retrieval and efficient processing of large financial datasets.
On the front-end, I used React.js to build a user-friendly interface that allowed customers to manage their accounts, make transactions, and view their banking details. I also managed the implementation of secure authentication and authorization using OAuth2, JWT, and Spring Security.
One of the key tasks I performed was setting up a comprehensive logging and monitoring framework with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack. It helped us in proactive issue detection, real-time performance monitoring, and incident resolution.
In terms of team collaboration, I worked closely with a team of product managers, security analysts, and DevOps engineers. My role involved not just contributing code, but also mentoring junior developers and aligning technical solutions with our business objectives.
As for areas of improvement, I'm planning to delve deeper into AWS and Azure cloud services. I'm also interested in learning more about machine learning algorithms and how they can be integrated into traditional software systems to make them more intelligent and efficient. I believe that continuous learning and improvement are key to staying relevant in the ever-evolving tech industry.
What I want from work is an environment that encourages continuous learning and professional growth. I appreciate a collaborative setting where I can both share my knowledge and learn from others. I'm interested in being part of projects that are innovative and challenging, where I can make a tangible impact. I also value a good work-life balance, which helps me maintain productivity and enthusiasm about my work.
On the flip side, I don't thrive in environments where there's a lack of clear communication or direction. I believe that a successful team needs to have open channels of communication and a clear understanding of their goals. Similarly, I wouldn't want to work in a place where there's no room for innovation or where the culture doesn't support raising new ideas or questioning existing processes. It's important for me to feel that I can contribute to improvements and innovation."

In my role as a Software Developer, I played a key part in crafting and maintaining a seriously high-traffic application. We went with this cool thing called Microservices architecture to make sure our system was scalable and performed like a rockstar. From figuring out who does what in the architecture to getting hands-on with the nitty-gritty of development, I focused on the stuff that really mattered to make our app a success.
Deploying and orchestrating these Microservices was like putting together a symphony, making sure everything harmonized seamlessly. The real feather in our cap was handling a whopping 80,000 daily user requests – a true testament to our scalability game.
I also made sure our system was tough as nails by introducing backup plans in case any service decided to take a coffee break. Kept things in check by fine-tuning each Microservice and setting up tools that kept us in the loop in real-time. Always on the lookout for ways to improve, I took user feedback to heart, added some cool features, and made sure everything ran smoother than a well-oiled machine. It's not just about code; it's about making things work, and I'm proud of the role I played in that scene.
I am seeking a work environment that encourages creativity, collaboration, and continuous learning. I look forward to engaging with challenging projects that allow me to apply and expand my skills. A supportive team dynamic and open communication are crucial for fostering a positive workplace culture. I value opportunities for professional development and aim to contribute meaningfully to the success of the organization.
Moreover, I am keen on a role that promotes a healthy work-life balance, recognizing the importance of personal well-being in sustaining long-term productivity. A workplace that embraces diversity and inclusivity is of great importance to me, as it enhances creativity and innovation.
Non-Preferences:
I aim to avoid work environments characterized by excessive bureaucracy and a lack of clear communication channels. A role that offers limited opportunities for growth and learning would not align with my career goals. Additionally, I seek to steer clear of workplaces that undervalue work-life balance or lack a supportive team culture. An environment with limited recognition of individual contributions and a lack of diversity and inclusion practices would not be an ideal fit for me."

software engineer,"Senior .NET Software Engineer with over 12 years of experience in backend- and frontend development, with a strong focus on high-load systems, complex business logic, third-party integrations, and database design. At different stages of my career, I’ve contributed to both frontend and backend, including frontend-focused periods. Currently, my primary responsibility lies in backend engineering, with occasional frontend tasks.
I’ve worked in both service and product-based companies, mostly in international teams across the US and EU. Key technologies: .NET Framework / .NET Core, C#, ASP.NET MVC/Web API, Entity Framework, T-SQL, MS SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Azure/AWS/GCP, React, Angular, NoSQL, CI/CD tools (TeamCity, Azure DevOps). I apply SOLID principles, clean architecture, and focus on maintainability and business value.
Currently I’m part of a product team developing a large clinical research platform. My role includes:
designing and building a new system core to enable product scalability;
optimizing performance under rapid data growth;
developing and evolving the main Web API and its documentation;
delivering system integrations within the ecosystem;
taking part in product discussions, prioritizing features, and proposing business-oriented solutions.
Previously, I contributed to a healthcare SaaS platform: scaled cloud infrastructure, reduced server costs, implemented automated testing at multiple levels, and helped build new features and integrations. In another project, I automated legacy update workflows via CI/CD pipelines, saving hours of manual effort weekly and enabling regular releases.
Earlier projects included:
building web apps from scratch for tourism and retail startups;
optimizing existing enterprise applications (e.g. for auto repair chains);
designing the architecture of a large advertising system;

Flexibility is also important to me — I want the ability to work from anywhere in Ukraine or the EU, without location-based restrictions, which is especially relevant in today’s hiring landscape.
Prefer:
Stability and transparency in the company
Backend-focused roles (.NET, cloud, distributed systems)
Clean architecture and modern tech stack
Ownership mindset and real impact on the product
Collaboration with skilled engineers

software engineer,"Most of my recent 10-year experience has been developing web backends with .Net technologies (monolithic and micro-service architecture). However, I have considerable knowledge of Golang and Python. I would happily switch to Golang whenever possible, assuming other conditions are acceptable. I also have some (relatively modest) frontend/full-stack experience, and I strongly prefer Vue.js (3rd version) with TS to all other frontend technologies I've encountered.
My older experience includes years working as an SQL developer and DBA, so I am skilled at SQL and similar technologies.
When working with .Net, I strongly prefer Entity Framework over any other ORM (I like using no raw SQL but LINQ instead). I am pretty skilled with expressions. I value a strongly typed approach to coding over shortcuts and quick-coding solutions. Nothing makes me feel more comfortable than firm control over my code. I use unit tests whenever they look viable, along with a strongly typed approach, and this combination allows me to end up with robust and well-maintainable code.
My beloved role does not involve leading a team, managing, or teaching people. Instead, I prefer pure technical challenges that nobody else likes to take because they look too complicated, are non-standard, have fuzzy conditions, etc. However, I am always happy to share my technical knowledge and experience with anyone who is genuinely interested. I like to learn from others even more than I like to share my knowledge.

software engineer,"I’ve had the chance to work on some pretty cool projects over the past few years, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. At MinIO, where I’m currently a Software Engineer, I’ve been diving deep into cloud-native tech. One of my favorite projects this year was building a file upload scanner for the MinIO Subscription Network. It was all about making things more secure and compliant for enterprise users, which felt really impactful. I also worked on setting up monitoring for Kubernetes CSI-attached storage (DirectPV). Another fun task was automating UI testing for aistor using playwright; it boosted our test coverage and made the whole system more reliable, especially for the recent product addtition (Large language model). I’ve also led some architectural improvements for distributed systems, weaving in microservices best practices and tweaking API gateway configs with Gloo. Oh, and I got to enhance observability by setting up distributed tracing and real-time logging—seeing downtime drop and performance improve was a big win.
Before this, during my internship at MinIO, I got to design proof-of-concepts for big names like Intel and Tesla, tackling multi-cloud challenges. I also pitched in on the open-source side, fixing bugs and submitting pull requests to make the core product better. At Geobeyond, I built an API to simplify some tricky REGO stuff with OPAL and tied it into GeoJSON APIs.
Tech-wise, I’m pretty comfortable with a bunch of tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Istio, and eBPF for cloud-native stuff; Golang, Python, JavaScript, and a bit of Rust for coding; and then Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for infrastructure and monitoring. I’ve worked across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid setups, and I’m big on REST, GraphQL, and observability—think tracing, logging, and keeping microservices humming.
As for what I want to improve? Honestly, I’d love to get even better at Golang—it’s such a powerful language, and I’ve only scratched the surface. I also want to deepen my eBPF skills; it’s such a game-changer for performance tuning, and I think there’s more I can do with it. On the softer side, I’d like to work on explaining complex ideas more simply—sometimes I get so into the tech that I forget not everyone’s on the same wavelength!
The first is a centralized subscription management system that links all of a Nigerian user’s bank accounts using their BVN.
The second is an apartment rental platform that simplifies the hunt for a place to live.
I’ve recently wrapped up a project I’m particularly proud of: a system that tracks toxic gas emissions for companies. It not only monitors emissions in real time but also lets management calculate and pay their taxes based on the data."

software engineer,"From the beginning of 2018 until the spring of 2019, I worked as a freelancer. After that, I joined a medium-sized outstaff company where I am still employed.
My first project involved developing an internal CMS system for the recruiting department, followed by a project for a large bank. In this role, I was primarily responsible for improving the development experience across several teams.
Initially, we focused on building an internal framework for managing dynamic forms. This solution allowed users to create and publish forms without the need to release the front-end application, using a drag-and-drop constructor from our custom back-office system.
Once we implemented the core system and established processes, we decided to enhance the environment for front-end (FE) developers. This included creating scripts for building, linting, and testing, as well as configurations for demo environments and CI/CD processes. We also aimed to deliver best practices for the entire department.
After some time, I felt ready to take on a leadership role. At the end of 2021, I transitioned to a new project where I led a team responsible for creating the MVP of a platform that allows Americans to buy or sell vehicles. During this time, I learned that in professional software development, negotiations often hold more importance than implementation.
Since then, I have worked on several similar projects involving MVP creation, and each time it has become progressively easier to articulate the business vision of the domain and define rules for the architecture of the FE codebase."

• Led a team of 7 developers, developing and implementing new features, leading to a 15% increase in platform efficiency.
• Conducted research to enhance functionality and best practices, increasing overall system performance by 20%.
One of the accomplishments that I am particularly proud of is the successful transfer of a legacy JQuery codebase to React, Redux, and TypeScript while working as a software engineer at The Boston Consulting Group on the Retail Catalyst project. This project helped the world's 500 largest corporations to improve their sales and create scenarios to analyze gross profit, unit lift, and price change.
I led a team of 4 other mid-level software engineers and we faced several challenges during the transition such as managing the complexity of the code and ensuring that all the functionality was retained during the transition. To overcome these challenges, we adopted a phased approach, where we first identified the critical functionality that needed to be retained and then gradually refactored the code.
Our efforts paid off, and the project was a success. The new codebase resulted in a 25% improvement in user retention and provided a more efficient and maintainable codebase for future development. My personal contribution to the project was leading the team, managing the project, and providing technical guidance and mentorship to the other engineers.
In my next role, I am looking for an opportunity to work with modern technologies such as React and Node.js, and to continue using TypeScript for its static typing benefits. I am interested in working on projects that are challenging and innovative, and that allows me to contribute to business growth and make a meaningful impact. I value working with a collaborative and dynamic team, and I am interested in working in an environment that values professional development and provides opportunities for skill-building and career advancement. I would like to avoid roles that lack challenge or that work with outdated technologies and software development practices."

software engineer,"Hi! I have been in e-commerce and fintech projects for about six years. I use PostgreSQL as the main DB in almost all of my projects, REST API, Kafka, RabbitMQ to communicate between services, and async task processing. I have acted as the backend team lead for the last four years. To be honest, partially. My key responsibilities currently are code review, performing hotfixes, writing tasks for developers, delivery, code refactoring, planning improvements, searching for potential bugs, and interviewing. Often, I don’t have enough time to write code.
I’m searching for new challenges and looking for opportunities to work on great projects
I built a working process to clarify the development process for the team principal and involve developers in the product problems
I led huge refactoring processes with success
I developed and successfully implemented a hiring process in my team
I think the fact that after four years of mentoring, I am sane is already an achievement)
Have more fun with coding and less with management, if possible.
Don't rewrite tasks after POs/business analysts.
Have fine management with team performance control.
Work in collaboration with strong product owners who have a vision for product growth and know how to describe their ideas to the development team."

software engineer,"I have around 5 years of experience in programming. I mostly worked on the back end of the development using Java, Spring, REST, etc., and do many tasks using these technologies. I can solve tasks by applying the best programming practices. Besides, I have a strong understanding of OOP principles and experience in applying patterns. I love making things work as expected on time. I am interested in an active lifestyle, and complex tasks that are ready to perform. Quickly adapting to new environments, and new technologies, and facing new challenges.
My main accomplishment in my last job is refactoring the payment system, so the data about clients' products and rate plans are stored in the cloud, not hardcoded in our codebase. With this improvement, we no longer need to deploy the code when the client decides to change the rate plan price. The whole process (implementation, testing, deployment) could take up to 3 days. Now it's just updating the field in the payment system cloud and evicting the cache using an admin endpoint. The whole process takes up to 15 mins which is a huge difference
My main goal is to apply my programming skills and improve them by being a part of a software development team, obtaining experience, and delivering services and products, which meet client's needs. One of my objectives is constant professional growth and keeping track of new technologies and software development practices."

software engineer,"Hello! My name is Oleksandr. I worked in the field of 3D art, where my main task was to create characters and environments. My experience in this field is two years. During this time, I worked on commercials and projects at GameDev.
One of my first projects was a commercial for TV where I created environments and characters. Later, I joined the exv.io project and continued to work on creating exciting characters. I also had a few freelance jobs, although they were of little commercial importance.
Then I switched to development in Unity using the C# programming language. One day I joined an exciting startup where we were creating a metaverse called WOWent. The team consisted of only two developers, and I was given responsibility for development on the Unity platform. It was an amazing adventure and the whole metaverse was based on our work with Unity.
In addition, I also have experience in web development. I am fond of using various frameworks such as Nest.js, Vue, WebGPU, Angular and Three.js. I am currently busy developing a game engine on WebGPU.
I am proud of my career achievements. When I joined the WOWent project, I had a position as a 3D artist. However, in order to contribute more to the development of the project, I mastered the programming skills in two weeks and began to write code actively. This experience allowed me to broaden my skills and take on new challenges with confidence.
I am always ready for new adventures and strive to further develop in the field of development and creativity."

Have certificate about Java courses, but software development language is just a tool, it does not tech you how to solve problems.
Used to be top rated here on upwork. Most of my previous clients return back, because they saw I am responsible, and easy to work with. Once I hit a very tight deadline for one client, I used to do overtime, even when the client did not ask that. I did that because the client told me that the situation started out of control from a management point of view. And things that depended on me were done earlier, after I started to help other team members.
I am a good team member, easily integrated into any scale team. Even after years, I am still in contact with my colleagues from the office. I used to do coaching for a crypto startup, because the manager did not have the time to do that, used to be a co-founder as well.
Have experience working at the office. Worked with a large trading system, with source folder 500MB for Java backend as full stack developer. After I released that I did not grow at that position at all, and decided to try freelance. Here I found that it is very different from the office, great, interesting and different opportunities that I love to work with."

software engineer,"I am working as a software engineer for over a decade (11+ years).
Throughout the years worked with different projects for different companies (remote roles, collaborating with Italy, SA, and UK, and on-site roles) mainly working as a full stack engineer focused on the backend/ frontend and CI-CD. In the majority of the companies I worked for I have been engaged in team lead roles as well (facilitating sprint refinement, planning and reviews, code reviews, coaching and helping other peers give their best).
Started in 2013 as mobile app developer working (building android apps with java) and then moved to cross-platform app development with Xamarin, React-Native (a little Ionic Cordova). In the meantime I was working on the backend (domain analysis, system design and development). Different projects required me to work with Serverless (AWS or Azure functions) or Microservices architecture with .Net Core microservices (following Domain Driven Design principles and CQRS pattern).
One major focus on the last 4 years has been React which I used in lots of projects.  Recently I have been working with NextJS as well (PWAs).
Setting up CI-CD pipelines (unless we had a devops team) have been part of my working and for that I used tools such (CircleCI, DroneCI, TeamCity, Fastlane, Github Actions, Azure Pipelines).
I have a good knowledge of AWS and even bootraped projects from scratch to production via ECS, ECR, Route53, EC2, RDS, Redis  (infrastructure was provisioned through IaC yaml templates using Cloudformation).
In the software development I really emphasize and advocate for clean code, correctly designed with patterns that allow scalability, maintainability and being testable. Also performance is such an important thing to keep in mind and to review from time to time when building software (what ever kind).
I love working on fast-paced, team-oriented, deadline-driven environments and also I am very people centric because at the end of the day we are humans and I always believed in helping and supporting each other can only lead to great outputs/results.
Working closely in a big project for one of the giant clients in SA (MC Donald's)
I would like to have to do with companies/roles that offer paid time off because I think it's very important for an engineer to have the possibility to take time off comfortably. We need to recharge oftentimes and knowing that we can recharge well, adds a lot of extra motivation."

Experiencе
PROJECT: Integration of SAS Fraud Management System.
This project was aimed to implement system that analyzes all transactions from our bank client and prevents or puts on hold any fraud cases or suspicions activity.
My job was to create proxy layer (I called it adapter-fms) and for all bank transactions to go through that adapter. Its job would be to receive REST requests from our bank services, accumulate necessary data along the way and send it to SAS FMS.
Also, I needed this adapter to work fast and ensure that responses will be returned under 1 second. So, for that reason I used multithreading and caching.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2), worked with bank core system (flex cube), used Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queuing, PostgreSQL.
PROJECT: Ordering salary cards online.
This project was about providing our customers with the opportunity to order salary cards online.
My responsibilities were to create business logic, write unit tests, calls to DB, provide REST Api’s for front end developers.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2), some parts were written with Golang and Kotlin, worked with bank core system (flex cube), used Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queuing, PostgreSQL.
PROJECT: Quiz app for English courses.
This project was about to provide our clients with tools to create quizzes.
My job was to create admin panel where users can create blog entries, quizzes, choose its type (free or exclusive for course students), edit them, activate (so it would appear on students side). Also, here we have store section, where admins can add products which users can buy with coins, received from completing quizzes. Also developed user side, where we can register on the site, complete quizzes and collect points and coins, buy stuff on store, see leaderboard.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2) and Golang, implemented logic to store quiz images and videos on the cloud (digital ocean), also write adapter-mail-sender for internal purposes.
Developed bank web application module related to memorandum generation for mortgage contracts. Worked with bank core system (flex cube), directly communicated with clients, designers. The best part was getting gratitude from bank workers because our application made their life much more easier."

Participated in migration of a core service from .Net Framework to .Net Core. It was a pretty challenging task, the service was large, had my class libraries and third party dependencies. We had to extract as many microservices as possible from this core service as a preparation for migration. Then we developed a new web-api host, with enhanced authorization processing, moved all code from an old web-api host to new, controller by controller - it last for 8 months approximately because of integrations with other services. The idea was to reuse all existing libraries, but have separate web-api and consumer hosts for .net core.
After all work was finished, old web-api host was terminated.
Another interesting challenge was to develop a service that mimics logistics market behavior and forces customers' clients to intuitively select options from customers' partners as the most beneficial ones. The challenge here was in calculations of different parameters and scenarios, we applied many patterns for that: several chains of responsibility, builders, strategies and decorators. We had complex sagas and pretty effective system overall. It brought the customer significant increases in revenue.

software engineer,"For one of my last projects I was involved in creating a microservice-based system from scratch:
- working on concepts
- inter-service communication
- setting up CI/CD
- feature implementation.
Prior to this, I was mainly working with web stack (JSP, Thymeleaf, Spring (MVC, Boot, Security, AOP, Data, Batch, WebFlux), Hibernate, AngularJS, etc).
I have a little bit of commercial experience with mobile platforms (Android, IOS (Objective C)).
I have experience being a team lead for 6 people. Built the team from the ground up. The team was operating for 2.5 years.
I was:
- mentoring colleagues
- discussing requirements with the client
- creating proof-of-concept solutions
- implementing new features
- fixing bugs
- helping my colleagues with demos to the client (highlighting business values of the features we demo).
1. I was working on creating a back-end for a multiplayer video game, using a microservice architecture. I was responsible for the following:
- designing the architecture of the system
- setting up CI/CD (GitHub workflows + version release process to GitHub Packages & Azure Container Registry via Helm charts of our own making)
- designing inter-service communication (REST API + event bus)
- integration with 3rd party game services (namely Steam)
- integration of an OpenID Connector solution into the chain “ExistingBackEnd-Client”
- implementation of a scalability system within one app which revolves around the number of available k8s instances
2.  There was a modular AngularJS application, and I was tasked to implement a mechanism of persisting and applying page filters across all the pages of the app - you add different filters on one page, then navigate to another one, and all applicable filters from the previous page are applied
3. Reworked (performed refactoring on) a piece of functionality (~1000 lines) with a convoluted flow (a lot of ""if""-statements, a lot of execution jumps), which was faulty in production. I increased the test code coverage of the piece above of functionality first.
4. Along with a teammate of mine, we've drastically sped up the main page of the app, which resulted in local & written gratitude from the client + paid bills in any restaurant for the whole team (including everyone's significant other).
5.  I managed to build a friendly atmosphere in a team of 6 people (devs and QA):
- the team was self-sufficient (out of tasks -> grab one from the backlog, need help -> ask a lead/colleague );
- introduced knowledge cross-sharing - back-end devs were working on front-end tasks, and front-end devs were taking back-end tasks (no coercion, we were aiming to become full-stack devs). If/when there were questions/problems in the foreign field, the ""native"" developer (back end for server, front end for client) helped with resolving those
- taught colleagues to handle constructive criticism in pull requests
I'm looking for a project which is (to be) written in Java-based language (Java, Kotlin, Groovy). Kotlin is preferable, but Java is OK too.
The usage of GraalVM would be a plus.
I prefer to work with the Spring Framework, but am not limited to it.
I'd like to work on a project which doesn't simply put deadlines before the devs, but also has an adequate amount of planning (grooming sessions, team velocity calculations/adjustments)"

software engineer,"I started my career as a software engineer in 2019, and for the past three years, I’ve been working as an IT consultant firm, primarily on projects for government clients. My focus has been on mobile development, where I’ve had the opportunity to design, develop, and deploy applications that address real-world challenges and improve user experiences.
While I’ve specialized in mobile development, I’ve always made it a point to avoid limiting myself to just one area. Whether it’s backend development, frontend design, or even DevOps, I see all of these as interconnected pieces of the same puzzle—solving computational problems. For example, in one of my projects, I not only built the mobile app’s frontend but also collaborated on optimizing the backend APIs and setting up CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment. This holistic approach has helped me develop a well-rounded skill set and a deeper understanding of how different components work together to deliver a seamless product.
Later, I transitioned to my most recent role at Chup.online, where I worked on a product called Chup, which optimizes patient experiences by auto-rescheduling appointments in real-time. The system adjusts to delays or emergencies, ensuring minimal wait times and improving overall efficiency. When I joined the project, I was the sole developer handling the mobile side of things. This was a challenging but rewarding experience, as I took full ownership of the mobile application—from designing the architecture to implementing features and ensuring smooth integration with the backend systems. My work directly contributed to enhancing the user experience for both patients and healthcare providers, and I’m proud of the impact it had on streamlining operations."

Career Development
Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer and aim to grow further in areas such as improving application architecture, optimizing CI/CD processes, and mastering new cloud technologies to develop scalable and high-performance systems.
Achievements
Technical Leadership and Successful Product Launch: I successfully led the development of an application from scratch, serving as the technical lead while being directly involved in coding (approximately 30% of my time). My responsibilities included gathering requirements from the client, building the application's architecture, and ensuring timely delivery. The application was successfully launched and operates effectively.
Crisis Management and Client Retention: When project managers unexpectedly went on vacation without notifying the client, I took the initiative to manage the communication and prevent escalation. I stepped into a leadership role to maintain client relations, ensured transparency, and addressed their concerns. As a result, the client expressed their desire to continue working with me specifically, appreciating the strong collaboration and the results we achieved together.
Expectations
I am looking for a role that offers opportunities to enhance my skills, work on engaging projects, and utilize a modern technology stack. Cloud technologies, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and artificial intelligence are areas I am particularly interested in exploring further.
From a work environment, I expect professionalism, clear communication, and a collaborative team culture where every member feels respected and valued. It’s crucial for me to have a transparent workflow and a supportive team dynamic.
What I want to avoid is constant overtime and working without clear requirements or goals. Clear expectations and a structured approach to tasks are vital for productivity and satisfaction.
Client satisfaction is a top priority for me, but it’s equally important to achieve it while maintaining respect for my expertise, my team, and the company. I value professional relationships where mutual respect and trust drive collaboration, without the need for unnecessary compromises.
I am highly motivated to improve my communication skills and build strong relationships with clients. I believe that establishing solid connections is the key to a successful project and long-term collaboration.
Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for me. I prefer remote positions with flexibility in working hours, allowing for a focus on results rather than rigid schedules."

One of the most difficult projects related to React was an online school and it was necessary to make a board with many different types of tasks, and work with sockets, that is, the teacher had to see the student's board and what he was doing there, there was a group board and indicators for connecting students, and so the same ability to switch the teacher between students. Well, student grades, course progress, lessons, dictionaries, etc.
I led a project where we were developing a tool that could implement advertising on a website. The frontend was on React + AWS, and the backend was on Go. This is a very high-load project, because a huge number of products were advertised through this tool, especially on Black Friday and the New Year holidays.
DataDog and Sentry were used for data tracking.
There was a project for a scooter rental service, where I completely made the admin panel, from which I could configure the parameters of scooters, track them on the map, block them, etc.
In addition to all this, there are a lot of pet projects.
Also, there is an excellent experience in mentoring (RReactJS, NodeJS, FE lab programs with a total of 7 students), code review and refactoring, and setting up a project from scratch (React, husky, ESLint, etc.).
Extensive experience in conducting technical interviews for junior/middle level front-end developers (more than 20 interviews).
I don’t have strict preferences for projects, but I want to be useful to people, and therefore it would be cool to work with projects in the field of medicine, security, logistics, banking, or something related to finance or cryptocurrencies.
According to the technology stack, these are React and related technologies.

One of my key achievements was designing a microservices architecture for a warehouse system by breaking a monolith into six microservices. This transformation significantly improved scalability and accelerated deployment processes. One of the microservices I developed processed over 200,000 requests daily, handling data transformation, integration with external systems, and database optimization.
I also focused on enhancing system performance—optimizing queries to reduce processing time by 15% and implementing reactive programming to handle asynchronous events. By introducing more than 50 custom metrics and a real-time monitoring system, our team was able to quickly detect and resolve issues.
Additionally, I developed new UI components using ReactJS and TypeScript, integrating them with backend services via REST APIs. This improved user experience and added critical functionality to the product.
In my work, I leverage modern technologies such as Java (17), Spring Boot, Hibernate, AWS (S3, SQS, etc.), Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and observability tools like NewRelic and Splunk.
Prior to my career as a software developer, I spent five years in test automation, specializing in building automated frameworks and testing APIs, web, and mobile applications using Java. This experience gave me a solid understanding of quality assurance processes and helped me design systems with testability in mind.
In the future, I aim to further develop my expertise in building high-load systems, deepen my knowledge of cloud technologies (particularly AWS), and work on designing distributed systems that prioritize performance and reliability."

software engineer,"I would like to inform you about my story. After completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at ADA University (Baku, Azerbaijan 2021), I decided to continue my education with master's degree at Yildiz Technical University.
During my undergraduate study, I focused on improving my skills in backend development with JAVA programming language. I started with some Udemy courses to get initial knowledge about general backend development at first step. Then, specifically I tried to work with Java Spring, developed some basic CRUD applications, and uploaded them to my GitHub account. After starting my master’s degree, I continued to develop my skills, and in my second semester I got an internship opportunity at Yildiz Technical University Technopark for backend development at the company called IPera AI. During and after this long-term voluntary internship at Yildiz Technical University Technopark, I gained more than one year of experience in the field. I utilized Java Spring to design, develop and maintain CRUD operations on the application. Besides, I leveraged my expertise in Microsoft SQL Server writing new task-based queries. Furthermore, conducted thorough testing and debugging to identify and correct software defects. Using Jira tool, I gained experience in Agile methodology as well. During my second back-end development experience in MELIC, I mostly implemented JPA/Hibernate for efficient ORM mapping and used Mockito to write unit tests for ensuring code quality.
In addition to my professional experience in back-end development, during master's degree education I joined a competition team called “DroneX” to participate in TEKNOFEST and we won first place in 2023.
Finally, currently I am pursuing my PhD degree at Yildiz Technical University, and I would like to say that I am very passionate about software engineering, especially backend development, and I am eager to leverage my skills and work on new projects within your company. I believe my motivation and desire for continuous learning can contribute to your team. I hope you will review my detailed resume, provided in the attachment, and consider offering me an interview opportunity. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for the Software Engineering position.

software engineer,"As a student, I developed myself in the field of Front-end development through participation in various educational projects and completing interesting tasks. One of my first projects involved creating a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned the basics of HTML to create the structure of web pages, CSS to provide styles, and JavaScript to add interactivity.
Later on, I started using the React library to build more complex and dynamic web applications. With React, I could effectively manage the application state and reuse components, which significantly simplified the development and maintenance of projects.
I also studied the Bootstrap framework for quickly creating responsive and stylish interfaces. Utilizing Bootstrap allowed me to rapidly prototype and ensure compatibility with different devices.
To improve the organization and styling of CSS code, I began using the SCSS preprocessor. It provided me with the ability to use variables, mixins, and nesting, which greatly facilitated working with styles.
Recently, I have been deepening my knowledge in the field of Node.js, which enables the use of JavaScript on the server-side. This opens up new possibilities for developing full-fledged web applications that leverage server-side logic and interact with databases.
In the future, I aspire to continue my development as a Front-end developer, focusing on expanding my knowledge in JavaScript. I plan to explore new technologies and development approaches to become an expert in my field and create high-quality and innovative web applications."

software engineer,"My expertise cuts across data science, data engineering, IoT, Cloud, full stack web development, mobile app development, and UI/UX design.
I have worked as a solo engineer at a company where I made most of the technical decisions and learned a lot of lessons along the way. Subsequently, I became the technical lead as more members joined the development team. Using GCP, Node JS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Postman, and other tools and technologies, I developed a backend application for a logistics application following business requirements. The app includes tests, role-based auth (using JWT access tokens and refresh tokens), and complex entities & relationships, email & sms functionality, sentry for monitoring and reporting, and other functionalities. Subsequently, I built a React Native app to consume the backend APIs and implement auth and persistence using Async Storage and Axios (interceptors for refresh tokens), and Magnus UI for styling.
I have also worked as a full stack developer in a small but highly effective team of 4 developers from 3 different continents at a startup in Europe. Using React Native, Firebase, and other technologies, I contributed immensely to the development of 2 mobile apps: e-commerce/shopping and rider app. I dealt with numerous bugs along the way and learned from them. I also contributed to the development of a web admin platform through which the overall business processes can be managed, as well as a backend app for payments using Stripe.
In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer, I worked primarily with Azure (Function Apps, Log Analytics, AppInsights, AppConfig, APIM, Alerts), Terraform, Typescript, EventHubs and Apache Kafka, GitHub Actions , and Grafana. My contributions to the team included continuous development and deployment of the cloud services.
In my current role as a Senior Software Engineer at a major UK bank, I developed and managed a robust suite of microservices, achieving a 95% reduction of avoidable calls into operations. I lead a team of six experienced developers, ensuring adherence to project timelines and quality standards while managing the expectations of stakeholders. Additionally, I mentored two software engineering apprentices, fostering professional growth and development.
Using Python & Selenium. I developed a script to automatically perform user registration actions on a portal that typically takes 100+ people and 3 days for completion while interning at a software company. The actions include selecting an appropriately stored user file from the file system, filling a multi-step web form, and then downloading the resulting processed registration data into another appropriate location. I received instant recognition from all members of the organisation, as I was the only one exploring a variety of technologies that could solve everyday problems.
As a Masters level Big Data Technologies student, I developed a scalable road surface anomaly Machine Learning profiling pipeline using HiveMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark on Databricks, MongoDB, Node-Red, Sklearn, TSFresh, Python, and Javascript. Drivers can send accelerometer readings from their smartphones while on the road to the pipeline which will then process the readings as windows and determine whether it is a regular road, pothole, speed bump, ditch, or metal bump. For potholes, the profiling information includes the depth of the pothole in centimetres.
I value continuous learning and professional growth. I expect to work in an environment where opportunities for learning new technologies, attending conferences or workshops, or participating in skill-enhancing activities are available."

software engineer,"7+ years of hands-on commercial experience in software development as a full-stack (backend-to-frontend)
I've been working as a team leader for more than 2 years
Preferably node.js + react stack
Started with Java and later switched to Node
I have a broad understanding and knowledge of the fintech, ad-tech and hotel services fields.
I have experience in the following areas:
- web scrapers;
- REST/GraphQL APIs
- update of project's dependencies to new major versions with breaking changes;
- complete platform redesign;
- reduction of frontend bundle size;
- algorithm complexity optimization (by either applying appropriate data structures or rewriting the algorithm itself);
- resolving security issues;
- services scaling preparations: WebSockets and microservice scaling
- and other stuff I could have forgotten :)
I would rather admit that I have no experience working with server-less architecture and server-side rendering
Also from the interesting points, I can highlight that I played a vital role in growing the project from a startup to one of the most competitive products on the market, leading to its acquisition.
Moreover, I was engaged in the transition of the product from monolith to the microservices architecture
From a non-technical perspective, I have experience in holding scrum ceremonies, planning sprints and technical backlogs
- Led a big rebuild of the product and was taking a vital role in designing and building new architecture. Using the updated product, users started building their ad campaigns 80% faster and time-to-interaction decreased almost by 3 times;
- By participating in feature design product sessions, managed to prove the importance of moving synchronous ads personalization features to asynchronous which led to positive users' feedback that increased sympathy for the product heavily;
- Introduced tests obligation and adopted TDD within the team resulting in a ~25% reduction in bug findings during the regressions;
- Prepared technical backlog, proved its necessity for the product and led the development of multiple tech debt epics such as: API & WebSockets scaling, Enable publishing of > 50 000 ads to the Google at once;
- Introduced and set up TypeScript to the backend codebase by creating the first microservice of the product;
I do not want to join a project with a big amount of legacy code or CRM development.
I want to improve my hard skills so I would prefer a project with Nest.js on the backend and strong Tech Lead/CTO I could learn from."

- a group of six students with various background (from none up to junior front-end) to their first NodeJS REST API in a month;
- two front-end students for their new back-end positions;
- several Junior level students to Middle level.
My English is around C1+, and considered by many to be significantly above average comparing to the majority of candidates from Ukraine. I am collaborative, reliable, responsible, – everything that a professional in a team of professionals must have.
Overall, my outstanding contributions are mostly related to increasing developer experience and improving team performance. These include: optimize build pipeline, improve issue discoverability (logs and alerts) on environments, setup Continuous Improvement process, etc. I have a history of successfully persuading a customer to have a certain small development improvement, which my predecessors couldn't achieve.
- a WFH-oriented host company, that performs salary reviews once or twice a year (or more frequently);
- a project not related to misleading or intentionally harming people;
- a management that controls results, capacity and deadlines, rather than screen time; minimal employee monitoring and surveillance or lack thereof.

Each front-end app from scratch delivers match pain on start when you need to add all primitive components such as form elements, headings, navigations etc, and most painfull it's when you need to copy-paste all styles from figma, but in my opinion ui designers insted of developers must control styles and each simple redesign of app, fortunately figma has a rest api thats why I made script which generates css variables based on shortcodes added to figma layer names, such as it was a long time ago in bootstrap, and on another end React components styled with Styled Components, with scope styles fuctions based on the same shortcodes.

software engineer,"Started in 2005 as layout master (HTML, CSS, jQeury) in a small web studio, then begun working with CMS (WodrPress, ModX), gradually started to understand PHP and JavaScript. Since 2014 working as a front-end developer for large outsourcing companies such as EPAM, SoftServe, N-iX. Initially, worked with Angular, but from 2016 almost completely switched to React.
Two years ago, I managed to get on a project and gain some experience with Express and AWS.
On several projects, I was engaged in the code transition to TypeScript. Wrote tests for Jest, Enzyme, and React Testing Library.
In scope of work in R&D department took part in research and description of viable technical solution for clients startup idea.
Conducted a large-scale refactoring of the API services and related hooks. As a result, found several dead services/hooks, several duplicates, and outdated code.
Implemented automatic sub-navigation based on the react router configuration. Thus made router config a single source of truth. In addition, the menu was moved to the root page to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.
On the other project, I exported an illustration of a rating gauge with an arrow and a color gradient from green to red to SVG from Figma. In the browser, the gradient was completely broken. It turned out that SVG doesn't support conical gradients, Figma imitates them, but when exported, it replaces them with a regular linear gradient. I didn't want to change it to a raster image, because when resizing, it would create the feeling of something incomplete and of poor quality. I simulated the conical gradient with linear gradients by dividing the gauge into several sectors. Each sector had its own part of the overall gradient with own specific angle.
Currently I am pretty flexible in terms of salary. But I found out that I've been filtered out (probably automatically) a few times due to my rate. So I set it to non-sense minimal  value.
I have a good experience with React, so I'm primarily interested in projects based on this framework. However, it would be very interesting to learn a new framework such as Solid or Svelte. I also have some experience in Node.js and would like to deepen my experience.
I am happy to work with layout, various visual effects, and animation. I miss this kind of work a bit. In large corporate projects, almost all layout is handled by corporate components framework."

software engineer,"I'm in development since 2011, so I have had a chance of working on projects in different industries, from advertising to government projects, from logistic systems to payment providers, and so on. But my experience is mostly in startups.
I've been lucky enough to challenge myself in different roles. For example, I led and managed a team size of 25 people, or I was ""solo-sailing"" as an expert. These are the tools/technologies I have hands-on experience:
Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery, Django channels, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Redis, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, REST API, GraphQL, RPC, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud, CI&CD (Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Actions, CircleCI), Serverless Delivery (AWS Lambda, GC Functions), Git, Linux, etc.
And also, I have experience with Node, Typescript, Express.js as well.
Building a data migration tool was definitely one of the most interesting challenges that I tackled—the tool allowed users to migrate from one e-commerce provider (WooCommerce, Shopify, PrestaShop) to another. Because of the system's scalable architecture, the app migrated 1M products with orders, users, and image assets within minutes. In addition, the system was designed in a way that to allow run dozens of migration in parallel without any issue. And because of the tool's ""plug and play"" nature, adding support for new e-commerce providers required a few lines of code.
I want to work on a product and get to know all the ins and outs of the system to contribute more productively. I wouldn't enjoy building one-page applications or corporate websites."

A notable example is a biometric authentication integration system, where I built a robust architecture using .NET 5/6/7, Angular, and AWS tools, ensuring seamless third-party integration and scalability.
My expertise in DevOps includes implementing and managing CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, enabling smooth deployment workflows and minimizing downtime. I also gained hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes, building containerized solutions and orchestrating scalable production environments. Automated deployment processes I developed improved efficiency and reduced error rates during releases.
I have led teams of 4–10 developers on multiple projects, mentoring team members, distributing tasks, and conducting code reviews to maintain high-quality standards. I fostered a collaborative environment, working closely with clients to align project goals with business needs and ensuring timely delivery of solutions.
In addition to these, I designed and implemented cloud-native solutions using AWS and GCP, leveraging services like S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudFront. I also developed microservices architectures that supported modular development and high fault tolerance, significantly enhancing system performance and scalability. Successfully deploying and maintaining systems in production, I monitored performance and ensured high availability using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Istio. I introduced performance optimizations, such as database tuning and caching, which improved overall system response times and user experience.

software engineer,"I have versatile and wide knowledge collected over the past 10 years. For the past 5 years I have been working with Go Kubernetes and automation. Before that I built various web services using many different technologies, based on whatever what in use in the product when I joined or what the team was comfortable with.
To list a few:
- The product couldn't support a $500k/annual client due to performance issues. The product didn't have any performance testing due to complex microservices architecture and difficulty in simulating all the moving parts. In 1 month I built overall understanding of all the architecture and have built a tool that performance tests the product end-to-end and simulates only the part that was very expensive. This meant that running it was cheap and all the important pieces worked as in production with almost nothing being mocked or fakes.
- A remote company had many hour meetings where people gathered to make design decisions. This was inefficient because people had variable proficiency in the English language and had difficulty collaborating. I advocated and pioneered the use of design documents. There were still meetings but the main discussion started to happen via the design docs.

software engineer,"I had a versatile experience:
- started in 2019, I've grown in ""domestic"" environment built for the specific needs and development processes of mature product. In this environment I've created a lot of digital content for CRM systems and this very specific product architecture.
- Closer to mid 2020 my interest grown and I've started to explore backend development with MEVN stack, it lasted for 6 month. I haven't evolved to a complete full-stack engineer, but deepened my understanding of web tech. Created pet projects and some basic full-stack websites.
- After 1.5 years of engineering career I've switched to project management in order to deepen my overall competence in IT field. I've worked with web and mobile teams, with specific integrations and interesting products.
- After almost year of PM switch I've returned to engineering and worked with 3-month long e-gov project from Germany. Back then, in the end of 2021 I've included Nuxt.js into my toolset for the first time.
- Next step of my career involved the big project which I've led for almost 2 years and was involved as a consultant for it right before project end and v2 deployment. It was an internal platform to run business processes of mature USA-based business, it included a lot of automations, APIs integrations and custom features. I've built a backend as a BFF solution - huge piece of various utils connected to SQL database via specific REST API, it also involved Firebase for auth and special features. Here I've started to use Vue 3 (the project needed version upgrade from v2) and also migrated backend API layers and helped a new backend team in designing and understanding the product and needs.
- I also actively freelancing since the start of 2023 and enhanced my skillset with newer version of Nuxt.js (v3), Tailwind and more. During 2023 I've also implemented a couple of internal web products - small educational hub and recruitment portal, together with 2 lesser projects for specific businesses.
Looks like internal products for scaling business have became my strong side, but I'm always open for a new challenges!
I always build great communication with client and team. Such approach allows to improve the product and exceed expectations.

It was a Ticketing module on a CMS , there was a feature I had to build that was an automated escalation of tickets for customer support.
This CMS could be used by any organisation and the Ticket module was the backend for handling whatever Tickets the customer support was dealing with. When it comes to handling tickets of customers, there are SLA's of resolution times and escalation levels. So I built a configurable matrix of escalation levels.

software engineer,"I'm eager to leverage my analytical skills and attention to detail from my full-stack development experience to excel in this position. I'm a fast learner and enjoy collaborating in a team environment.
In my role as a Full-Stack ERP Developer at Condigital, I was tasked with overhauling the company's accounting module within our ERP system to improve accuracy and efficiency. The existing module was outdated, leading to frequent discrepancies in financial reporting and inefficient data processing, which posed significant challenges for our accounting team.The first step involved conducting a thorough analysis of the existing system to identify pain points and areas for improvement. I collaborated closely with the accounting team to understand their workflows, requirements, and the specific issues they were facing. This collaboration was crucial in ensuring that the new system would meet their needs.I then redesigned the accounting module, integrating advanced features such as automated reconciliations, real-time financial reporting, and enhanced data validation checks. This required me to utilize both my front-end and back-end development skills. On the front end, I developed a user-friendly interface using React to allow accountants to easily access and manipulate financial data. On the back end, I used Node.js and PostgreSQL to ensure robust data processing and storage capabilities.One of the major challenges was ensuring data integrity during the migration from the old system to the new one. I developed and implemented a comprehensive data migration plan, including extensive testing phases to validate data accuracy and consistency. This involved writing complex scripts to transfer data while maintaining relationships and ensuring no information was lost or corrupted.The project culminated in a seamless transition to the new accounting module, which significantly improved the accuracy of financial reporting and streamlined the accounting processes. The automated reconciliations and real-time reporting features reduced the time spent on manual data entry and error correction, allowing the accounting team to focus on more strategic tasks.This project not only enhanced the functionality of our ERP system but also demonstrated my ability to tackle complex challenges, collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, and deliver solutions that drive operational efficiency and accuracy."

NDA:
- Integrated several feed providers by consuming their APIs, as well as the integration of new sports, such as racing, which had unique data types compared to traditional match-type sports.
- Played a key role in developing the system's feed outage handling capabilities. This involved ensuring that markets were immediately closed when feed providers were down, preventing potential data gaps or inconsistencies that could affect our customers. I also worked on notifying traders about the outages, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the available information.
- Improvement in our automatic market pricing components: I enhanced the configuration capabilities of the automatic market pricing components, providing our traders with more flexibility to adjust pricing according to market demands. These improvements resulted in better risk management and allowed us to provide more competitive pricing to our customers.
- My extensive knowledge and experience with the system quickly led to my selection as a member of the steward community. In this role, I actively participated in code and architecture design reviews, providing valuable insights and suggestions.

For example, I’ve created single-page applications with components that handle state management efficiently—think e-commerce dashboards or task management tools—using hooks like useState and useEffect to keep everything responsive and smooth.
Beyond React, I’ve also honed my skills in vanilla JavaScript, which has been invaluable for projects requiring custom logic or when I needed to optimize performance outside of a framework. Whether it’s manipulating the DOM, handling asynchronous API calls with promises, or writing clean, reusable utility functions, I’ve leveraged JavaScript as the foundation for many of my solutions.
On the back-end side, with Express.js and Node.js, building robust server-side applications. I’ve set up RESTful APIs to power my front-end projects—like user authentication systems or data endpoints for real-time updates—using Express to handle routing and middleware, while Node.js keeps everything lightweight and scalable. For instance, I might have paired this with a MongoDB database to store user profiles or product inventories, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.
Speaking of databases, I’ve got hands-on experience with MongoDB, where I’ve designed schemas for NoSQL data and integrated them into my apps. I’ve handled everything from basic CRUD operations to more complex queries, like aggregating order data for a reporting feature, making sure the data layer supports the app’s needs efficiently.
I’ve also explored Next.js, which I love for its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities. With Next.js, I’ve built projects that needed SEO optimization or faster initial load times—like a blog platform or a portfolio site—taking advantage of features like API routes to keep everything in one cohesive framework.
For mobile development, I’ve ventured into React Native, creating cross-platform apps that run on both iOS and Android. I’ve tackled challenges like navigation, local storage, and native UI components, delivering apps that feel polished and performant—think a food delivery app with real-time order tracking or a fitness tracker.
I successfully led the development of a food ordering platform using React, Express.js, and MongoDB, delivering a seamless user experience with real-time cart updates and a scalable back-end, which increased user satisfaction by 30% within three months. As a combatant in the Defense Forces of Ukraine, I’ve demonstrated resilience and teamwork under pressure, skills I bring to my technical projects to ensure timely, high-quality deliverables. I also optimized a Next.js-based portfolio site, reducing load times by 40% and improving SEO rankings, showcasing my ability to balance performance and functionality.
want to work on challenging, impactful projects where I can continue growing as a full-stack developer, particularly in areas like cloud-native applications, AI integration, and mobile-first solutions. I’m eager to collaborate with diverse teams, contribute to innovative products, and make a positive difference—drawing on my technical skills and my experience in the Defense Forces of Ukraine to bring discipline and determination to my work. I don’t want to be in roles with limited opportunities for learning, creativity, or advancement, or environments that lack teamwork and support."

software engineer,"I am a Senior Software Engineer / (Team Lead for the last 3 years) with 10+ (nearly 15) years of experience in commercial software development, primarily focused on data mining, high-volume data pipelines, and sophisticated back-end solutions. My journey began at a small startup that scaled successfully and was acquired by Rakuten, and later transitioned under NielsenIQ—exposing me to multiple corporate cultures, challenges, and objectives while essentially working for the “same” evolving company. This has given me a deep product mindset, where I view software as a long-term investment (“a marathon, not a sprint”) and encourage every engineer to think beyond their immediate task to broader business goals and future-proofing the infrastructure.
My core technical expertise includes developing low-level backend code for microservice architectures, monolith-to-microservices migrations, and solving critical issues in distributed, highly loaded, concurrent systems. I primarily use a Java (JVM) technology stack, along with SQL databases (MySQL), Redis, Memcached, ZooKeeper, AWS, and Kubernetes. Across various organizational transitions, I have led architectural decisions alongside other senior engineers, since we did not have a dedicated architect role. I have also led teams of up to 12 engineers, handling technical mentorship, project coordination, and performance reviews.
With extensive international collaboration experience (teams in the USA, Canada, France, India), I excel in cross-team communication, agile methodologies, and continuous improvement. I strongly believe in product-centric thinking—ensuring every feature or change aligns with broader business objectives—and strive to follow best practices (SOLID, clean code, Uncle Bob, Martin Fowler) as well as the foundational ideas of the Gang of Four.
Currently, I am seeking an innovative company with a modern vision and new challenges that can leverage my background in large-scale data processing, distributed systems, and product mindset. I am open to discussing salary, considering the responsibilities of the position and the company’s benefits."

software engineer,"Hello,
I am based in Athens (GMT+3), where I live and work,
I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and over 20 years of experience in the field. I have worked on numerous projects involving complex systems and have a proven track record of delivering solutions.
My key strengths:
Strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and designing for performance.
Proficiency in Golang, C based languages, Java, SQL, and modern software design patterns.
Ability to work in an agile development environment.
I have worked as the main IT reference point for a prominent Classified Media company - we have been no.1 in the Italian market;
Some examples of my achievements are:
- at the time (years 2006 - 2008) PostgreSQL didn’t have a good replication system that would allow us to parallelise servers to scale up the number of users per session or the overall queries/sec
Our Java App needed to scale, “to ramp up” at a specific time of the week, to reach an overall of ~90k visits per day so:
I separated the database, into 2 tiers, effectively dividing the data in a vertical way,
putting in one what was to be used in the users back office, aka settings and input database…
in the other layer, a fresh PRE-processed snapshot of the data to be queried in real time.
This approach allowed us to duplicate the second layer into n number of servers (data sharding) to achieve the needed performance increase. This was also rendered possible by a good architectural choice that a few were making at the time: to store binary data (images and video) inside the db as large objects.
- More recently I was asked to change a large set of ETL scripts: those were targeted at one version of the database and needed to be updated to run in the newer version while keeping the old one still active and running.
Instead of duplicating the whole thing, I created a small set of parsing shell scripts, basing it on standard comment lines; these scripts, together with the needed SQL changes, are now making it possible to regenerate the two sets  of ETL’s from a common codebase.
- Since Docker was introduced, years ago, I integrated it into a range of projects: implementing application containerization at every stage of development and migrated several legacy products, reusing existing architecture and frameworks. I believe containers are truly the future for a modular and modern IT world, where sandboxing, real life testing scenarios and collaborative development are easy to implement.
I like taking care of a domain or an application in a specific industry, I can oversee pretty much any phase of software development, from drafting up an MVP to setting up a complicated application deployment with signing, etc.
I have designed and brought to life pretty complex app scenarios using more than one language or framework, and I am able to learn really fast - I am an open person looking to meet new people and work with them to develop exciting projects!"

About myself:
I am responsible, I learn easily and quickly, don’t have bad habits, and I don't do sports regularly, but I like to
play table tennis, and chess often, I also like to solve puzzles, my favorite is the Rubik's Cube, also many
variations of it like 4x4 or another shape, solving sudoku-type puzzles, nonograms. My strongest point is
my ability to act according to an algorithm, because of that algebra came to me very easily and very quickly."
software engineer,"I have worked on three projects as a Python back-end developer and on one as full stuck engineer. I have experience with both REST and gRPC approaches. One of the projects used a serverless approach. I have experience with microservice architecture and solid architecture. Used framework such as Flask, various libraries and ORM. Using Kubernetes, I made requests to remote services and received the necessary responses. I would like to develop more in web python, but I am ready for new and interesting challenges in the field of this programming language"
software engineer,"I have been programming for 30 years and have used over two dozen programming languages. I have already forgotten more languages than others knew by name alone. So I don't care what language to write in. But lately, I've been writing in Python, so now I know it best. Other languages will have to be remembered.
Most of my career has been in industrial automation. I had to develop literally all types of software used in engineering production. Accounting, warehouse accounting, payroll, production planning, supply, and optimization of technological processes.
I wrote programs for regular computers and servers, single board computers, microcontrollers, mainframes, and even CNC machines and UAV.
Of course, in recent years I've mostly had to work with web frameworks, databases and various data processing. I have developed systems for trading on crypto exchanges, instant messengers, a real-time simultaneous voice-to-voice translator, optical recognition systems, and an optical navigation system for drones. And it’s not even worth mentioning such little things as online stores and ERP systems.
1. On-board seeding control system with real-time data transfer to a remote server. Made on the basis of a single-board computer. The system was mounted on a tractor and received data from the planter's sensors and GPS. Data was sent to the server via the GPRS modem using the MQTT protocol. Based on these data, a map was generated for the agronomist with sowing tracks, colored depending on the quality of sowing. Locally, the tractor driver could view the data on the built-in screen of the device or via Wi-Fi using the web interface on the phone/tablet. Sensor parameters can be configured both locally and remotely. It is possible to update the software remotely. Used: SPI connection to the built-in screen; communication with sensors, control buttons, and GPS receiver via UART (separate microcontroller on STM32); web interface - vanilla JavaScript; data transfer to a remote server - MQTT (supplemented with buffering in case of loss of connection); all parts of the system work asynchronously in independent processes on separate processor cores; communication between parts over WebSockets.
2. Parser of the largest online store in the country. Every night it downloaded descriptions and prices of all products. Performed normalization and cleaning of data and converted it to the format required by the customer. The parser was multi-threaded, and worked through proxy servers, with a request rate limiting and User-Agent spoofing (to prevent blocking).
3. Multi languages synchronous voice-to-voice translator (details can not be disclosed due to NDA).
4. Distributed cryptocurrency trading system. Control server - Django / Celery / DRF / Postgres / Docker. Remote nodes - asyncronous workers for different trading strategies, running into separate OS processes for every trader. Remote cache - Redis. Transport - Rabbit MQ.
I definitely don't want to do frontend.
I look for interesting and even strange tasks.
The ones that no one has done before and doesn't even know how it can be done at all."

opportunity to optimize a specific stored procedure, which
significantly reduced response times and alleviated a page-
blocking issue. This optimization improved the user experience
of that particular page.
• In addition to my backend responsibilities, I worked with some
React functionality to implement the APIs I developed for data

Below are notable highlights, with a comprehensive list available in my CV:
1. BostonGene - Our team generates reports for doctors, which contain info about biomarkers, key biomarkers, microenvironment composition, patient-specific appendix, potential recruiting trials, potential treatment options, etc. I am defining/ modifying endpoints with appropriate test cases (unit & integration). During these period of time I worked on optimization tasks (sql queries or code efficiency improvements). Also, had setted up new concourse pipelines from a scratch for syncing up two environments in case of hotfixes. E.g. hotfix changes are putted on prod env and via these pipelines they are transferring to stg and then dev envs automatically.
2. Talkdesk - our team from a scratch implemented IVR & SMS surveys for a call center. The architecture based on  microservices. We used Java 17, Quarkus, REST API, Kafka, Redis, Jenkins, SonarQube, Kibana, New Relic. Engaged in end-to-end backend development, with additional responsibilities in DevOps, including modifying Jenkins pipeline stages, establishing SonarQube from inception, and creating dashboards in New Relic.
3. AltexSoft - Developed a unified service for all existing applications, as well as next-generation services to authenticate with. The service was implemented from a scratch and I had a chance to work on different parts. E.g. defining Models, Services, Repositories, writing Unit & Integration tests. We used Java 17, Spring Boot, REST API, Gradle, Lombok, Liquibase, PostgreSQL, Okta, Coveralls.io/ JaCoCo Jenkins
4. Epam Systems - I worked in this company more then 5 years and had a chance to join to different projects. One of them related with AWS (SNS, SQS, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, X-Ray). Our service transferred data from one DB to another by filtering/ changing data. After defining appropriate parties on AWS CLI, I collected the whole infrastructure based on terraform and also created parametrized pipeline in Jenkins.
In one of the companies we had a mentoring program and I assigned as a mentor for an intern developer. That program lasted 6 months and as a result, my mentee and I successfully passed it
I always appreciate transparency in a working environment and lead myself with the ""enjoy the ride"" motto.
Key considerations for me include:
1. PEOPLE. I had a chance to work within teams where colleagues inspire and encourage continuous learning and excellence.
2. TECHNOLOGY. While I understand the importance of maintaining legacy systems,  I prefer to work with modern technologies. I keen on to face with new challenges and study/work with new frameworks, libs, etc."

Chat:
In my latest project, I have architected and developed a comprehensive chat application with both user-facing and administrative interfaces. The project was initially implemented in .NET 6 but was later upgraded to .NET 8 to take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements. The application utilizes WebSocket for real-time messaging, enabling users to send text, images, and files seamlessly. It also integrates WebSocket and REST API requests, allowing for flexible user interactions and requests.
The application offers comprehensive chat management functionality, allowing users to effortlessly create chats, manage participants by adding or removing them, edit messages, and remove entire messages or specific content such as images or files. Users can also view all images within a chat in a convenient list format. Both users and administrators have the ability to search chats and messages, ensuring easy navigation and retrieval of information.
For administrators, I developed an advanced admin panel that grants full control over the platform. This includes capabilities to manage users—such as banning or deleting them—modify or delete chats, and actively monitor chat activity in real time. The admin panel is also equipped with powerful tools for searching and sorting chats and messages, as well as detailed access to user and chat information.

software engineer,"Project experience (from newest to oldest):
1. Big distributed enterprise retail system.
Responsibilities on my current project:
Developing new features, microservices, supporting the whole service development
lifecycle, including fully documented service management.
Creating all the necessary infrastructure for service deployment and monitoring (to track
possible performance downgrades and other issues).
Testing the code (unit tests, mutational tests and integrational tests), application
performance (load tests) and disaster recovery scenarios.
2. Cloud communications platform for Telecom.
Aside from learning multiple new technologies, best coding and design practices, the
biggest takeaway from the project would be the crucial experience I got on cloud
computing (AWS) and microservices as a whole.
3. E-commerce platform.
Development/Bug-fixing - optimized multiple processes within the project (using
caching, moving data processing from database to Java, optimizing SQL queries, using
external bulk API calls instead of single-item, etc.).
4. Legacy Inventory system for Telecom.
Customer support - I was a part of a customer support rotation. The tasks varied from
application server configuration to database script generation issues.
Bug fixing - We had to support older versions of the product, which were shipped as early
as 2014. This required a lot of non-trivial solutions and thinking as code base has changed
a lot over the time.
Development - got some hands-on experience on popular technologies.
1. I have contributed into internal-use module (general scripts used for building AWS infrastructure) by extending its' functionality to allow the use of different EC2 Load Balancers. This gave me important knowledge and experience in building infrastructure and AWS as a whole.
2. Resolved/mitigated many production issues as part of service support/maintenance. Some of them included highest priority issues that were affecting whole systems/subsystems.
3. I have individually driven multiple development activities without requiring micromanagement from the side.
