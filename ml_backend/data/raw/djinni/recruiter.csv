recruiter,"Results-driven, passionate, and collaborative team leader with a go-getter mindset and exceptional communication skills in English and Ukrainian. A senior recruiter and recruiting manager with a track record of delivering high-impact results - I generated 50% of my company’s annual revenue in just one month upon being promoted to supervisor.
Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with some of the world’s largest companies, including The Boeing Company, Arconic, ATI Metals, Morgan Corporation, Raytheon, Philips, BD, Akorn Pharmaceuticals, Cargill, Electronic Arts, Roche, UTC Aerospace Systems, and Harris Corporation. I excel in full-desk recruitment, leveraging strong negotiation skills to maximize client and candidate satisfaction. My expertise spans team building, coaching, employee retention, policy development, and time management.
I don’t believe in motivation - I believe in action. If you want something, you make it happen. I’m not looking for “just a job” to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks - I want to create real impact, inspire those around me, and drive meaningful change. Corporate recruitment is where I see the most opportunity to do so.
When I’m passionate about something, I make it happen. One of my key achievements was generating 50% of my company’s annual revenue in just one month after being promoted to supervisor.
Recently, I successfully navigated a complex situation where a candidate attempted to leverage a racial discrimination claim, which could have led to legal action against my company and our managed service provider. By facilitating clear and strategic communication between the client, MSP, and my agency as the employer, I ensured a seamless resolution that satisfied all parties involved.
I see myself in a company free from micromanagement, with a strong employee culture where mission and values are genuinely shared by the entire team. Culture is one of my top priorities, along with leadership that leads by example.
A key factor for me is work-life balance. Currently, I work in the U.S. time zone, but I am looking for an opportunity to transition to a Kyiv-based schedule. This shift would allow me to maintain high productivity while achieving a healthier balance between my professional and personal life.
When these expectations are met, I bring loyalty, dedication, and a strong desire to contribute meaningfully to the company’s success."

I specialize in full-cycle recruitment, employer branding, and process automation.
In my recent role as Head of HR, I developed and optimized workflows, launched employer branding strategies, introduced employee motivation systems, and implemented leadership and mentorship programs that significantly boosted engagement and team performance.
Looking ahead, I’m focused on advancing in strategic HR leadership, integrating AI tools, and driving business process automation. I’m passionate about contributing to tech-forward organizations that value innovation, agility, and people-first culture.
Built a high-impact employer brand that enabled proactive hiring from a pre-qualified talent pool, eliminating the need for external job postings and reducing cost-per-hire by 40%.

In this role, I strive to contribute to a company that:
Values strategic HR leadership and treats HR as a key business driver, not just a support function.
Invests in people, innovation, and corporate culture, fostering an environment of growth and engagement.
Encourages initiative, agility, and practical change, where HR plays an active role in shaping the company’s future.
I am open to joining teams of any size — what matters most to me is a culture of collaboration, efficiency, and shared vision. I’m eager to lead or support dynamic initiatives involving employer branding, employee motivation, leadership development, and HR process automation, especially with a focus on AI integration.
What I aim to avoid:
Bureaucracy that limits speed, innovation, and turns HR into a purely administrative function.
Lack of leadership alignment, where HR is undervalued and disconnected from strategic business goals.
I see HR as a strategic business partner — a core pillar of organizational success — and I seek an environment where this role is fully recognized, respected, and empowered."

recruiter,"В моєму досвіді роботи шкільним психологом я здобула вміння ефективно працювати з людьми, розпізнавати їхні потреби та мотивацію, а також підтримувати позитивний психологічний клімат у колективі. Я займалась проведенням тренінгів, консультацій та програм, що сприяли розвитку командної роботи та особистісного зростання, що є ключовими навичками для роботи у HR та рекрутинг.
Моя здатність швидко налагоджувати контакт з людьми, розв'язувати конфлікти та підтримувати довіру допомогли створювати ефективне робоче середовище, яке можна трансформувати в успішні стратегії для підбору персоналу та роботи з кандидатами. Я також маю досвід управління емоціями людей, що є важливим аспектом у процесі комунікації з кандидатами та забезпеченні позитивного досвіду для них.
Крім того, мій попередній досвід роботи в сферах адміністрування, продажу та обслуговування допоміг мені розвинути аналітичні навички, здатність працювати в команді та вирішувати складні ситуації, що є важливими аспектами для успішної роботи рекрутера або HR-менеджера
Психологічна підтримка та розвиток команди: У своїй ролі шкільного психолога я успішно організовувала тренінги та консультації для вчителів та учнів, що сприяли покращенню міжособистісних стосунків та командної роботи. Це досвід, який дозволяє мені ефективно працювати з командами у компанії, забезпечувати здорову атмосферу та покращувати взаємодію між колегами, що є важливим аспектом для роботи в HR.
Робота з конфліктами та емоційним кліматом: Маю досвід у вирішенні конфліктів та управлінні емоційним кліматом у колективі. Це безцінні навички для рекрутера, оскільки здатність вирішувати ситуації, які можуть виникнути під час співбесід або в процесі адаптації нових співробітників, є важливою частиною моєї підготовки до цієї професії.
Розвиток персоналу та комунікаційні навички: Я маю досвід у проведенні тренінгів, спрямованих на розвиток комунікаційних навичок та емоційного інтелекту, що безпосередньо корелює з навичками, необхідними для підбору кандидатів та їх адаптації в компанії. Мої знання допоможуть створювати навчальні програми для нових співробітників, підтримувати їхній розвиток та покращувати ефективність комунікації в організації.
Оцінка та розвиток потенціалу: У процесі роботи я постійно оцінювала особистісний розвиток учнів, що допомогло мені розвинути навички оцінки потенціалу людей. Це є важливим аспектом роботи рекрутера, коли потрібно оцінювати кандидатів, їх сильні та слабкі сторони, і робити правильний вибір для компанії.
Емпатія та слухання: Моя робота психологом навчила мене уважно слухати та розуміти потреби людей, що є важливим для успішного рекрутингу. Вміння налагоджувати довірчі відносини з кандидатами та співробітниками дозволяє забезпечити найкращий досвід взаємодії та взаєморозуміння
Я очікую можливості для професійного розвитку та навчання у сфері HR і рекрутингу. Мене цікавить участь у різноманітних проектах, де я зможу використовувати свої навички взаємодії з людьми та підтримки психологічного клімату в колективі. Я прагну працювати в команді, де можна буде розвивати як професійні, так і міжособистісні навички, а також отримувати зворотній зв'язок для постійного вдосконалення. Моє завдання — приносити користь компанії, допомагаючи знайти найкращих кандидатів, створюючи здорову атмосферу та сприяючи розвитку персоналу"

recruiter,"9 years in Recruitment, including 6,5 in IT Recruitment and 5 in leading roles.
Extensive experience with customers from all over the world, strong client-facing and communication skills.
I managed teams of up to 10 people, can be equally good at doing recruitment myself and organizing the team.
Experience setting up ATS for the team which didn't use it before.
I love transforming processes, analyzing things as-is and suggesting an optimal to-be flow. I don't have experience setting teams or processes from scratch, but why not?
Some of my experience was in close cooperation with Business Development department (participating in hiring for presale projects, conducting market analysis and assisting BizDev with drafting budget and commercial offers for new customers), so I'm open to positions that are in the middle of recruitment, account management and presale activities.
Love building trusting and stable relationships with clients and teams and helping both sides to get along well.
Advocating, introducing and implementing an ATS for the team which didn't use it before.
Introducing and implementing clear, understandable KPIs for recruitment.
Extending the team which initially included only recruiters to a combined team of recruiters + researchers.
Hiring for tech roles of all level in Ukraine, Poland, Romania.
I prefer companies which either have processes that are already up and running, or are open to transforming them and making them more clear - it's hard and often non-productive when things get too chaotic.
It would be interesting to try working for a product company (most of my experience was in IT service companies, so product is somehow new to me).
Roles related to presale, resource management or account management for IT staffing companies might be interesting as well :)
I'm fine with people of various mindsets, approaches and work culture, as long as both sides are ready to listen and hear each other - we can always meet in the middle, but we both need to be ready for that, and then everything will work out."

In my opinion, a Recruiter is the face of the company on the job market and the person whom the first and most important impression of the company depends on. Candidates write many reviews on DOU specifically about recruiters and their first impression of meeting them. Therefore, the ability to communicate and find a common language is one of the most important qualities of a recruiter.
2. Attentiveness and literacy (oral, written and technical). I think it is very important to carefully familiarize yourself with the requirements and the market and be able to find information on your own, so as not to leave a bad impression on candidates about the company, minimize mistakes and to fill vacancies effectivel.
3. Time management. The ability to manage time is also a very important trait of a recruiter, since this profession is constantly in flux and requires versatility.
4. The desire to develop and grow professionally. This trait is necessary for most professions, especially in the IT field, which does not stand still and requires constant knowledge. This is also important, because in order to effectively fill vacancies and create teams, it is necessary for the recruiter’s to burn with enthusiasm."

recruiter,"Hello!
I’m excited to share a bit about my journey and how my passion for HR and recruitment can bring value to your team.
With a solid foundation in talent acquisition and HR management, I’ve successfully led the end-to-end recruitment process across multiple industries, sourcing top candidates, crafting compelling job descriptions, conducting interviews, and ensuring a seamless onboarding experience. In my recent role at Patexia, I thrived in a start-up environment where I wore many hats, from managing the HR system (PeopleForce) to organizing quarterly meetings and collaborating with external partners. I also took on various cross-functional projects, including managing freelancer relations, optimizing operational tools like phone systems, and providing crucial support to senior leadership.
What sets me apart is my ability to adapt quickly and effectively in fast-paced environments. I’ve implemented HR tech solutions that improved team efficiency, managed PTO and employee data, and spearheaded initiatives that fostered a positive workplace culture.
I am eager to continue growing in HR project management, talent strategy, and the integration of new HR technologies. I thrive on improving processes, ensuring smooth operations, and building strong teams that align with company values. My experience with tools like Jira, BambooHR, Zoho Recruit, Slack, and others allows me to easily integrate into new systems and quickly add value.
A unique aspect of my background is my five-year experience in the modeling industry, where I traveled extensively. This experience developed my adaptability, communication, and relationship-building skills, which have been instrumental in my HR career, especially when working with diverse teams and stakeholders.
I’m now looking for an opportunity to leverage my experience in a challenging role where I can drive HR initiatives, help shape company culture, and support talent acquisition and development in a dynamic, forward-thinking organization.
Led the implementation of the first HR system (PeopleForce) for the company, streamlining employee onboarding, time tracking, and PTO management. In a startup environment, took on multiple roles, managing projects such as team-building activities, and accounting, and successfully introducing and negotiating with an SEO agency, all while working with limited tool choices. Additionally, I created and led an English-speaking club to enhance team engagement and communication skills."

recruiter,"Building an Effective Recruitment Process:
I created an effective recruitment process from scratch for an international product company by developing a unified recruitment policy that ensured a consistent approach to talent acquisition across all countries.
Team Formation and Leadership:
I built and led a strong in-house recruitment team of 8 individuals, developing a robust motivation system that drove performance and cohesion.
Operational Activities:
Selected and implemented an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that:
Reduced hiring costs through strategic integrations (leveraging LinkedIn's limitations on job postings for cost savings).
Consolidated candidate data into a single, centralized database.
Provided transparency in the recruitment process for both candidates and hiring managers.
Delivered detailed analytics to continuously refine the recruitment strategy.
This comprehensive approach not only streamlined our hiring process but also contributed to the overall success and growth of the company.
Results:
Reduced the time to close key vacancies (TTH) from 6 months to 2 months for both technical and executive positions.
Ensured timely closure of all vacancies within the team.
Reduced recruitment expenses by $30,000 in the first quarter by transitioning to an in-house team and discontinuing agency use.
This optimization enabled the company to launch a new project—now one of its key initiatives—by effectively closing vacancies and optimizing resources.
Together with the team, we significantly reduced the percentage of candidates failing the probation period.
I want to work in a product company or startups (I'm a startup lover) where I can fully lead the Talent Acquisition team and be responsible for the strategy and results.
It's important for me to work in an environment that values freedom and creativity because these are my core values. I am constantly developing as a specialist and, especially, as a leader, and it's crucial that the team is driven toward growth and improvement, exchanging experiences along the way.

(також повністю допомагаю саме налаштовувати всі ці моменти за домовленістю)
-Створила своє навчання для рекрутирів та HR саме в направлені арбітражу трафіку. Це допомогло навчити дівчат та знайти їм роботу вже з певним розумінням сфери, термінології та вимог.
Про себе:
Як в житті так і в роботі дуже організована людина, люблю щоб все було чітко і структуровано, саме тому з перших кроків налаштовую інфраструктуру щоб все працювало як годинник, як в hr відділі, так і в усієї компанії. Націлена на результат. Саме до своєї команди рекрутерів завжди відношусь з повагою, позитивом та розумінням. В образу не даю.
Прийшла в арбітраж взагалі без розуміння що це таке, навчалася з 0 прям на місці, як згодом дізналася зі спілкування з іншими рекрутерами вже на подальших співбесідах що мій досвід дуже незвичайний, бо свої знання я придбала набагато швидше, ніж зазвичай це трапляється. Тож дуже цим пишаюся.
Швидко зросла на своїй позиції, швидко адаптуюся, швидко закриваю вакансії, вмію будувати структуру, спілкуватися з людьми, навчати, заспокоювати, бути психологом та медіатором.
Хочу потрапити в зрілу компанію з людьми, які готові рухатися в одному направлені, прислухатися до порад, якщо вони є та потрібні.
Для мене важлива інфраструктура, гарні умови для співробітників, які я в майбутньому буду також пропонувати, звісно гарне до них ставлення."

recruiter,"My work experience spans nearly 9 years in recruitment, including 2 years in a Manager role. I'm responsible for overseeing hiring processes and serving as a key contact point between Delivery/Client and Recruitment.
I lead recruitment strategies, drive effective workflows across multiple teams, and develop innovative sourcing approaches. My role involves providing data-driven consultations and recommendations.
I collaborate closely with Delivery and Customer teams, Recruitment, Operations, Resource Managers, and C-level executives to ensure seamless coordination and successful outcomes.
The main goal of the company I worked for was to increase its global presence, which increased from 13% (Aug, 2022) to 60% (Aug, 2024). The total number of contractors in the company (delivery) increased by 3%.
To achieve such results, I was involved into development and implementing decisions that enable strategic decision-making regarding hiring locations and provide comprehensive guidance on how quickly and through which methods we can fill a particular vacancy or group of vacancies.
Additionally could be mentioned such results as:
a. Development and implementation of a strategy that reduced the time to hire from 24 days in 2022 to 14 days in 2024.
b. Reduction in the need to search for new candidates on the market (in 2022, new candidates filled 81% of vacancies, while in 2024, this number dropped to 56%).
c. Development of a recruiter assessment system that evaluates not only quantitative but also qualitative performance metrics and their dynamics.
d. Over the past year, I've managed the hiring process for 101 positions, 97% of which were filled within the expected time.
I would like to mention that while managing strategic and daily activities, I sometimes still close positions myself, so my hands-on recruitment experience is still very much with me."
