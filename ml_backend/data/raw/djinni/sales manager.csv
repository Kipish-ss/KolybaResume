I am an executive, responsible and communicative person. I have a high level of organization, learning ability. I can listen and hear. The skills of business correspondence and oral communication are well developed.
During the year of work as Lead Generation Manager, I managed to master the basics of the new profession. I increased the company's lead base by 110 Upwork leads, 20 potential partners, and 5 cold outreach leads.
In June of 2019, it was the first to fulfill the monthly sales target - the total result was 44,000 euros, and the largest one-time deal was 6,000 euros.
I have experience in organizing complex multi-stage transactions. Also, I work with post-sale support of partners.
I don't want to work on cold calls.
- I would like to try to work in a product company with well-established management and an experienced team.
- Interesting tasks and projects.
- The prospect of increasing income without an upper bound.
- Professional development perspective.
- A close-knit, friendly team.
I prefer to communicate in Ukrainian, not russian"

sales manager,"Працюю Sales Manager'ом, поєднуючи глибоке розуміння клієнтських потреб із власною стратегією продажів.
Основна спеціалізація — B2B-аутріч, з особливим фокусом на український ринок(мав досвід із іноземними ринками). Як керуючий повним циклом продажів одного з українських старт-апів, створив власний сейлз-процес, який охоплює Email-кампанії та LinkedIn-навігацію, з пріоритетом на вирішення проблем потенційного клієнта, у першу чергу керівників компаній (CEO/Founders).
Протягом роботи не лише самостійно вів повний цикл залучення клієнтів — від першого контакту до укладання угоди — а й виконував функції керівника міні-команди продажів."
sales manager,"Over the past few years, I’ve built a strong track record in EdTech, FinTech, and IT sales — taking on roles that combined sales management, partner success, and client-facing communication. In every company I’ve worked with, I wasn’t just checking boxes — I was driving growth, refining processes, and consistently delivering results.
In one EdTech company, I entered the Top 3 sales performers by my second month, managing the full sales cycle and closing corporate clients. I handled outreach, negotiations, objection handling (using SPIN and SMART methodologies), and post-sale onboarding, including forming custom learning groups for businesses.
In another role, I set three all-time department records, with the highest achievement being 226% of my sales target. I was responsible for bringing in high-value B2B and B2C deals — including closing international contracts worth up to €60,000. I managed everything from lead generation to final negotiations and continued account support. I worked extensively with CRM systems like HubSpot, Bitrix24, and Pipedrive, used tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Notion, and Google Workspace, and built systems to track pipeline and performance.
My experience includes working with international clients, primarily in the U.S. and European markets, often navigating long, complex deal cycles. I’ve built strong relationships with decision-makers, adapting my communication style to fit diverse business cultures, and often served as the bridge between the client and internal teams.
What sets me apart is my mix of strategic thinking, initiative, and structure. I thrive in startup-style environments where every action has impact, and I naturally take ownership of goals, constantly pushing to improve workflows and outcomes.
Currently, I’m aiming to grow further in the direction of Sales Operations, Partner Management, or Account Management — with a special interest in international B2B sales, automation, and performance analytics. My goal is not just to close deals, but to build scalable systems and long-term value for the companies I work with.
In my previous roles, I was fortunate to contribute to strong sales results across international markets. Within just two months of joining one team, I became one of the top three performers, thanks to a strategic approach and close client communication. I also helped set three department records, focusing on building long-term value rather than just short-term wins. Working primarily with the U.S. market, I’ve closed high-value deals exceeding €60,000, often navigating long and complex decision cycles with attention to detail and consistency.
My main expectation is to work with a product I genuinely believe in — something I can stand behind with confidence and enthusiasm. When the product aligns with my values and interests, I naturally become more invested in the process, the clients, and the results. I’m motivated by meaningful work, a supportive team, and the opportunity to contribute to something that brings real value to people or businesses. Everything else tends to fall into place when that foundation is strong."

I’m proud to have built my career across American, British, Spanish, and Ukrainian companies — gaining a global mindset, adaptability, and a deep understanding of real-world client needs.
In recent years, I’ve focused on the tech, driving full sales cycles and managing high-impact client relationships.
- At Lemon.io, I’ve closed 110+ deals and helped companies scale their engineering teams — aligning developer skills with real business needs. This work resulted in $1.9M+ in GMV.  I specialize in consultative selling, trust-based relationships, and delivering value that lasts beyond the first sale.
Before entering tech, I built a solid foundation in hospitality, events, and international client service:
- At Mogotel, I managed corporate sales and events for business clients — sharpening my multitasking and ownership skills.
- At CGC (Crypto Games Conference), I oversaw international IT events and stakeholder coordination, managing remote teams and solving complex logistics challenges.
- Onboard TUI and Royal Caribbean Cruises, I worked in premium sales and creative production — building strong cross-cultural communication and service excellence under pressure.
Beyond work, I’m passionate about visual arts, portrait photography, music, and Formula 1. I bring creativity, empathy, and a curious mindset to everything I do — always learning, always growing.
I’m now looking to join a purpose-driven SaaS or service-based tech company with a strong mission and a human-first culture. Ideally, it’s a small or mid-size international team where I can contribute meaningfully, grow the business, and build long-term client value.
Let’s create something meaningful together.
- 110 closed deals in tech sales
- $1.9M+ in total revenue
- 1,054 discovery calls completed
- 400+ client-developer interviews facilitated
- Improved lead-to-interview conversion rate from 64% to 91%
- Worked with clients across the US, UK, EU, LATAM, and more
- When promoted to Senior Sales position at Company A, I increased the average weekly revenue from $2000 to $4500 through strategic upselling and relationship management.
- I led GMV among Sales Executives for Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.
Personal:
- Visited 45 Countries.
No phone/SMS cold sales and lead acquisition;
No affiliate marketing;

sales manager,"I've been working in sales for the past 9 years. I worked in different fields from financial markets to web development. For the last 3 years, I've been working in a BPO business. My job is to close deals, sometimes help our agents pass their interviews with clients, and keep our clients satisfied. As well if the company wants to upsell I'm the guys they talk to about it. Right now I'm looking for a stable job in which I can grow financially and career-wise.
Why I would make a great sales manager? Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why.
First of all, I always get the job done, no matter what time it is or if I have to work extra. I'm result-oriented so leaving work exactly at 6 if I have calls later is not my style.
Second, I always try to find a win-win both for the company and the client. All of my conversations are friendly and I get straight to the point with the client so we don't waste each other's time. Only if I see that the client needs more small talk I would do that. But the main target that I have in my head is to close that person.
And lastly, I have a lot of experience in different fields which gives me an advantage over people that only worked in one. I can look at an issue or task from a different perspective and support it with my 7 years of experience working with the whole world.
Im really proud of that in every company im one of the best sales. I try to study the product and bring some new ideas that will eventually bring more money to the company. As well I lived abroad for more than 8 years. This gives me an advantage when talking to potential clients since I know how they think and what they need.
Im looking for a stable job that i can make a career out of. Product companies would be nice but if there are some amazing offers i will consider."

sales manager,"Учасник стартапу “Strix” (Sales & Communication)
Січень 2025 – дотепер
Я є частиною команди, яка працює над створенням розумного браслета для військових, спортсменів та людей із медичними потребами. Стартап досі перебуває у розробці, але вже зараз я активно залучений до формування стратегії просування, аналізу конкурентів та пошуку цільової аудиторії. Також я відповідаю за комунікацію всередині команди, створення презентацій, комерційних пропозицій і перші кроки у взаємодії з потенційними інвесторами.
Викладач англійської мови / Репетитор
2024 – дотепер
Я проводжу індивідуальні та групові заняття з англійської мови. Працюю з учнями різного віку та рівня підготовки. Розробляю програми, що максимально відповідають потребам студентів, акцентуючи увагу на розмовній практиці, граматиці та впевненій комунікації. Прагну зробити кожне заняття не лише ефективним, а й цікавим. Завдяки моєму досвіду в ораторському мистецтві легко знаходжу спільну мову з людьми.
Співвласник магазину велоодягу
2023 – 2025
Разом з другом ми відкрили магазин одягу для велосипедистів. Я займався просуванням та роботою з клієнтами, а також усім, що стосується сервісу. Це дало мені чудовий досвід у продажах, роботі з запереченнями та побудові довіри з покупцями. Бізнес був локальним, але ми активно працювали і в онлайні.
Про мене
Я маю добре розвинуте ораторське мистецтво: проходив профільні курси, виступав перед аудиторією, беру участь у студентських ініціативах.
Є стипендіатом фонду Карпінських у Стрию, що підтримує молодих лідерів та інноваторів. Мав нагоду спілкуватися з успішними підприємцями, зокрема з Тарасом Кицмеєм, співзасновником SoftServe.
Мені подобається продавати, знаходити підхід до людей і пропонувати те, що справді має цінність.
Стипендіат Львівської політехніки за академічні успіхи на профільній спеціальності «Управління ІТ-продуктами».
Пройшов професійні курси з ораторського мистецтва та регулярно виступаю публічно, демонструючи впевненість, енергію та вміння переконувати.
Самостійно організував та вів навчальні заняття з англійської мови, що допомогло покращити навички планування, викладання та комунікації.
У 15 років став співвласником локального бізнесу, що продавав велоодяг, і самостійно запустив онлайн-продажі.
Маю підприємницьке мислення: вмію генерувати ідеї, перевіряти їхню цінність для ринку та працювати над їх реалізацією.
Готуюсь до презентації стартап-проєкту “Strix” у рамках навчального акселератора: беру участь у розробці стратегії, створенні презентаційних матеріалів і треную навички пітчингу.
Брав участь у студентських подіях за участю топових українських підприємців — зокрема, мав можливість особисто поспілкуватися з Тарасом Кицмеєм, співзасновником SoftServe.
Постійно працюю над собою: вивчаю C++, основи продакт-менеджменту, маркетингу та продажів у сфері IT.
Володію англійською мовою на хорошому розмовному рівні, що дозволяє вільно спілкуватися з міжнародними клієнтами.
Хочу розпочати кар’єру в сфері IT-продажів, де зможу реалізувати свої сильні сторони: комунікаційність, стратегічне мислення та вміння знаходити спільну мову з людьми.
Шукаю команду, яка готова ділитися досвідом і давати виклики, завдяки яким я зростатиму професійно й особисто.
Очікую на можливість навчатися у досвідчених колег, працювати з реальними клієнтами, брати участь у створенні та продажі IT-продуктів, що приносять цінність.
Вірю, що зможу стати сильним гравцем у команді продажів і з часом — лідером, який розуміє як продукт, так і клієнта.
Маю амбітну мету — побудувати успішну кар’єру в ІТ-сфері, а в майбутньому створити власну компанію світового рівня."

sales manager,"I started my career in IT, performing various tasks primarily within the sales and business analysis spectrum.
As a Business Analyst, I was bridging the gap between clients and developers, keeping everyone aligned throughout the project. I gathered and refined clients' requirements, mapped out processes using BPMN, and created user story maps to visualize the customer journey. I'm skilled at analyzing data and visualizing solutions to find the best approaches. I'm comfortable with a range of tools that have helped me a lot in my work - from data visualization software like Power BI, Tableau,
and Looker to project management tools like Trello and Jira, to everyday workhorses like Excel and Google Sheets.
As the Sales Manager, I led a revamp of sales operations: crafting specific KPIs, reshaping lead acquisition, and adjusting the sales funnel and sales process to make them more agile and responsive to market trends. Subsequently, my involvement in pre-sales and sales, in addition to account management and customer success, allowed me to enhance the reliability and predictability of the sales process.
My additional besides-the-IT experience includes key roles in SGS - a big Name in the Testing, Inspection & Certification industry. Not only was I dealing with top-tier clients and overseeing essential projects, but I was also busy selling complex B2B services. Along the way, my communication skills got a serious workout, as I was chatting with technical and non-technical colleagues alike. This journey gave me a bit of everything—contract navigation with lots of stakeholders on board, negotiation, problem-solving, and handling of budgets. Leading teams of over 130 members further highlights my people management skills.
Within the IT domain, the changes I implemented as a Sales Manager and Business Analyst paved the way for steady growth and a twofold increase in monthly customer acquisition within a year.
I'm looking for an ambitious company where I can use my skills to contribute to the company's growth and success. I want to work in an agile environment. I'd appreciate it if the company supports learning and encourages trying new stuff."

sales manager,"For the past 6 years, I’ve worn many hats  when it comes to working with clients.
🧶 I’ve crafted ICPs, written prospecting sequences, executed outreach, conducted demo calls, converted them into clients, and then took care of them to ensure they stay satisfied.
🧶 Of course I also managed the full sales cycle, from prospecting and qualifying leads to securing new accounts through tailored demos and strong client rapport.
🧶 Sometimes I had to handle all sorts of requests and questions from clients, stepping into the role of a Customer Success Manager.
🧶 I am very used to covering clients from the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK across sectors such as software development, IT, healthcare, advertising, fintech, consulting, cybersecurity, recruitment, and online education.
🧶 I have experience leading a team of 4 SDRs and 2 researches, responsible for onboarding and KPIs. Developed an outreach and client reactivation plan based on market analysis, identifying growth opportunities to realize asset sales.
🧶 As a Marketing Specialist, I’ve spent a lot of time getting to know client behaviors.
I believe my previous experiences in sales, marketing, account management and business development granted me a 360-degree perspective of the client journey — from those early pre-sales stages, running demos, to building business development teams to boost sales from the inside."

- Займаюся допродажами існуючим клієнтам, збільшуючи середній чек і тривалість співпраці.
Досвід у проєктному менеджменті:
- Координую команди розробників і дизайнерів для виконання веб-проєктів, забезпечуючи їх своєчасну та якісну реалізацію.
- Підтримую постійну комунікацію з клієнтами: узгоджую очікування, надаю регулярні оновлення та оперативно реагую на зміни.
- Використовую інструменти управління проєктами (Asana, Trello) для організації процесів і контролю виконання завдань.
~10-кратне зростання середньої вартості угоди завдяки:
- Презентації індивідуальних рішень, що підкреслюють цінність для клієнтів.
- Ефективним переговорам, які дозволяють збільшувати бюджет угоди та працювати із запереченнями.
- Стратегії розбивки послуги на окремі компоненти, кожен з яких має самостійну цінність та підвищує готовність клієнта до більшої покупки.

Важливо, щоб компанія була орієнтована на клієнта та пропонувала реальну цінність, оскільки саме такий підхід відповідає моїм професійним принципам.
Шукаю команду, де цінуються співпраця та відкритість у комунікації, адже це створює умови для ефективного вирішення завдань та сприяє генерації сильних рішень.
Що точно не підходить – закритість у комунікації, відсутність чітких процесів і ситуації, коли немає можливості впливати на результати або пропонувати рішення."

Delivered eight sales presentations in one day with a 25% conversion rate, a performance considered exceptionally high in our industry.
What I Expect from My Next Role:
A Clean, Ethical Product – I want to sell a transparent, high-quality product or service that truly benefits clients and has a clear market fit.
Competitive Compensation – A strong base Salary + performance-based commission that fairly reflects my contributions.
Flexibility & Autonomy – I perform best in an environment with a flexible schedule and the freedom to make decisions, focusing on results rather than rigid processes.
Growth & Recognition – A company that values expertise and performance, offering clear KPIs, a structured sales process, and opportunities for career advancement.
A Strong & Supportive Team – Collaboration with skilled professionals who are open to innovation and continuous learning.
What I Do Not Want:
Weak or Undefined Sales Strategy – I prefer companies with a structured yet adaptable sales process, not a “figure it out yourself” approach.
Micromanagement & Bureaucracy – I value autonomy and efficiency over unnecessary restrictions.
Companies That Ignore Client Expectations – I focus on meeting client expectations, not just pushing products."

sales manager,"Hi there, dear recruiters!
I’m looking for a goal-oriented company - one that wants to grow, improve, and become stronger. Whether your team already has clear goals or is just starting to track them, I’d love to be part of that journey and help make it happen.
Here’s a quick look at my most relevant experience:
I’ve been working in B2B sales and business development for almost 7 years, mostly with tech companies. I’ve helped teams grow revenue, build strong relationships with clients, and improve how sales processes work. I’ve also built a sales department from scratch, so I know how to set up systems and scale them.
My main focus has been in outsourcing and outstaffing. I’ve done the full sales cycle: from lead generation and negotiations to closing deals and growing key accounts. I’ve signed high-value contracts through personalized outreach and by truly understanding what the client needs. I also created an account management system that helped keep clients happy and made internal work smoother.
I’ve worked closely with presale teams, helping shape offers and write proposals that win. Overall, I’ve got experience across the whole business development process - from the first contact to long-term cooperation.
My style is turning insights into clear actions that support growth and long-term success. That's why I'm proficient in data and business analysis.
Lately, I’ve also been involved in marketing, which gave me a fresh look at how sales and marketing can work better together.
On top of all that, I’m someone who really understands people. I’m empathic, and that helps me connect with clients and lead teams in a way that feels supportive and effective.
Everything I’ve learned so far helps me see the bigger picture and focus on what actually drives results.
So, if you’re still reading this, I hope we’re on the same page, and I’d be excited to connect!
- Increased annual revenue by 38% by improving sales strategy and focusing on high-potential clients.
- Reduced cost per lead by 75% through smarter lead generation and better qualification processes.
- Built a sales department from scratch, including hiring, training, and setting up workflows and KPIs.
- Closed multiple high-value B2B deals through personalized outreach and deep understanding of client needs.
- Developed an account management system that improved client retention and made internal communication more efficient.
- Grew average contract value by 15% through upselling and long-term client relationship building.
- Led a sales team that consistently met and exceeded monthly and quarterly targets.
- Worked closely with presale and marketing teams, helping create proposals and aligning sales with marketing strategies.
- Used data tools to track performance, analyze trends, and make better business decisions.
- I want to join a company that has clear goals and wants to grow.
- I’m looking for a company that’s transparent, honest, and works together to get things done.
- I want to use my experience in sales and business development to bring real results.
- I’d love to help set up or improve sales processes and make things work better and faster.
- I enjoy working in a place where ideas are welcome, and where people care about improving.
- I’m looking for something long-term, where I can grow with the company and take on more responsibility over time."

sales manager,"I have successfully led various projects as a Sales Manager, including developing and implementing strategic sales plans that significantly grew customer bases and boosted revenue. I've managed partnerships with key retail vendors, expanding market presence in the AR retail technology sector. I’ve also driven lead generation through targeted campaigns, webinars, and virtual demo sessions, which increased conversion rates. A key part of my role has been spearheading the integration of sales automation tools, reducing administrative tasks and allowing my team to focus on high-value client engagement.
I use CRM platforms like HubSpot, Zoho, and Salesforce to track leads, optimize sales processes, and manage customer relationships. I regularly work with Microsoft Office Suite and communication tools like Slack and Email to ensure efficient teamwork and communication. I’ve also implemented sales automation tools that have improved our efficiency and performance.
As a Sales Manager, I focus on aligning marketing strategies with sales goals, ensuring the team hits targets, and constantly refining our sales techniques based on market trends.
Moving forward, I’m looking to improve the automation of our sales processes and further streamline the sales funnel. I’m also focused on enhancing the client onboarding experience to drive customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, I plan to dive deeper into data analytics and AI-driven sales strategies to better predict trends and personalize my approach.
I have consistently generated over 300 qualified leads per month through cold calling, Email outreach, and social media while at Appy Parking, which significantly boosted our sales pipeline. By conducting 50+ discovery calls weekly, I increased lead conversion rates by 25%, helping the sales team close more deals. At Fast AF, I expanded the customer base by 25% through strategic sales planning, also increasing the average order value by 15%.
At RetailAR, I implemented new sales methodologies, which boosted inbound inquiries by 35% and grew the sales pipeline by 20% in the first quarter. I also integrated sales automation tools, cutting administrative tasks by 40%, allowing my team to focus on client engagement. By refining sales strategies based on market analysis, I improved acquisition approaches by 20%.
Additionally, I helped close 15 key accounts at Appy Parking, exceeding quarterly revenue targets by 10%, and enhanced customer satisfaction at RetailAR by 25% by improving the client onboarding process with a data-driven approach.
In my next role, I’m looking for opportunities to grow professionally and take on more responsibility in a dynamic, innovative environment. I want to be part of a team where collaboration and creativity are encouraged, and where my contributions can have a tangible impact on the company’s success. Learning new technologies and continuously improving my sales and leadership skills are high priorities for me. I thrive in environments that foster clear communication and provide room for innovation.
What I don’t want is a work culture where there’s limited room for growth or a lack of transparency. Micromanagement is something I prefer to avoid, as I value trust and autonomy to manage my tasks and responsibilities effectively. I’m also looking to steer clear of rigid structures that don’t allow for flexibility or the opportunity to explore creative solutions to problems."

sales manager,"Як менеджер з понад 5-річним досвідом у сфері B2B-продажів я здобула велику кількість практичних навичок та мала цікавий проект на реалізації, а саме створення партнерської мережі.
Мої основні задачі, як sales manager-a – не просто продавати, а створювати стратегічну цінність для бізнесу, будувати довготривалі відносини з клієнтами, оптимізувати процеси та впливати на результат.
За допомогою поєднання холодного та теплого залучення вивела відділення в топ-5 у регіоні серед 15+ відділень. Працювала з презентаціями, комерційними пропозиціями та проводила переговори.
Зараз я активно розвиваюсь у сфері IT – вивчаю frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) і прагну поєднати свій досвід у продажах з технологічною експертизою. Цікавлять ролі, де я зможу ефективно працювати на перетині бізнесу та технологій – pre-sale, product/client-facing ролях або sales у tech-компанії.
Завдяки каналам залучення та ефективним технікам продажу, як sales manager досягла:
- за рік вивела відділення в топ-5 у регіоні.
- реалізована B2B-стратегія забезпечила зростання кількості заявок на 20% і підвищення доходу відділення на 10%.
- як ментор успішно реалізувала програму навчання для 2-ох працівників.
- оптимізувала процес залучення клієнтів через CRM, скоротивши час обробки заявки на 20%;
Через високі комунікативні навички та роботу з запереченнями, як customer support agent:
- підтримувала високу якість обслуговування клієнтів.
- під час роботи з Turkish Airlines щодня обробляла до 200 запитів клієнтів із 90% вчасного вирішення, включаючи складні кейси.
Я бажаю, щоб моя майбутня компанія була зацікавлена в моєму професійному зростанні так само, як і я у її розвитку.
Вірю, що успіх залежить не лише від стратегії чи продукту, а насамперед – від від колективу. Саме команда є тією основою, на якій вибудовується стабільність і зростання – як цегла для фундаменту будівлі.
Моя мета – робити внесок: покращувати, підтримувати, вдосконалювати та створювати разом із командою. У той же час я переконана, що особистий розвиток і доступ до знань є не менш важливими для досягнення високих результатів. Мені важливо мати не лише обов’язки, а й можливості – для навчання, розширення професійних горизонтів та внутрішнього кар’єрного зростання.
Я очікую на колектив, де панує відкритість, командна підтримка, орієнтація на прогрес і здорову амбітність. Для мене мають значення прозорі умови праці, чітке визначення обов’язків у межах посадових функцій, чесне ведення справ та можливість висловлювати ідеї й бачення.
Я прагну бути не просто виконавцем, а повноцінною частиною спільної справи – учасником зростання, розвитку та змін."

sales manager,"As a seasoned Sales Manager with over 4 years of experience in driving revenue growth and leading successful sales teams, I have consistently delivered results through strategic planning, advanced CRM management, and a customer-focused approach. My expertise in optimizing sales processes and leveraging cutting-edge tools has enabled me to exceed targets and contribute to the long-term success of every organization I’ve been part of.
I developed and implemented a comprehensive sales strategy that included segmenting the market, identifying high-value targets, and creating personalized outreach campaigns. My approach to sales is both data-driven and customer-centric, ensuring that we meet our targets while delivering exceptional value to our clients.
I am well-versed in using advanced CRM tools like zoho, kommo, Pipedrive etc. to manage the entire sales lifecycle—from lead generation and qualification to deal closure and post-sale follow-up. I leveraged these tools to streamline our sales processes, improve pipeline visibility, and enhance communication within the team.
Furthermore, I am a strong advocate of continuous improvement and professional development. I regularly upgrade my professional training sales to ensure that I am  up-to-date on the latest sales techniques and industry trends. This not only increased my  performance but also allowed me to see how well I can grow as a sales manager and exceed my expectations in sales.
I am eager to bring my experience in leading high-performing sales teams, optimizing sales processes, and leveraging CRM tools to drive significant results for your company.
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong fit for this role, and I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to the continued success of your company.
As a sales professional, I have consistently achieved significant milestones throughout my career. I’ve led a team that increased annual revenue by 35%, secured partnerships with key industry players, and expanded our client base by 40% within 7months. My ability to identify and capitalize on market opportunities allowed me to close deals worth over thousands of dollars, often exceeding quarterly sales targets by 20%. Additionally, I successfully implemented a CRM strategy that improved lead conversion rates by 15%, streamlined the sales pipeline, and reduced the sales cycle by 25%. These accomplishments reflect my commitment to driving growth and delivering exceptional value to clients and the organization.
As a sales professional, I seek an environment that challenges me to grow, where I can leverage my skills to drive significant results and be rewarded for my contributions. I thrive in roles where I can work collaboratively with a team, have the autonomy to develop and execute strategic initiatives, and have clear opportunities for career advancement. What I value most is the ability to make a tangible impact on the company's success and build meaningful relationships with clients.
My expectations for the company would be to provide a work environment in which I can contribute to the team, prioritize growth and development as well as foster team contributions. Also, I'm comfortable with working weekends.
On the other hand, I don’t want to be in a work environment that lacks direction or support, where my efforts aren’t recognized, or where there is little opportunity for growth. I also prefer to avoid roles that are purely transactional, where the focus is solely on numbers rather than building lasting client relationships and creating value.
Finally, I am not interested in doing the bare minimum as i intend to go over and above in discharging my duties"

(More detailed information can be found from my CV)
From my achievements, I can highlight that I was a consistently top-performing manager, ranking among the top positions in the overall monthly sales rating. I could achieve the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th place in sales among all 38 managers in the commercial department, exceeding the financial plan by 130%, 140%, 150%, or 160%. Additionally, I consistently exceeded the daily call quota. It was planned that a manager should spend a total of 120 minutes on the line per day and make contact with 35 unique clients. Perhaps I was overly talkative in this regard, as I could communicate with clients for 200-220-240, or even 300 minutes per day and contact not only 35 unique clients but 40-45 or 50. In my opinion, such high daily efficiency led to good monthly results. I also want to mention that during my tenure in this position, I successfully retained problematic clients who had a negative experience after purchasing Prom.ua products, thereby enhancing customer retention.
I would like to further develop my skills and monetize my experience.

sales manager,"Last 2 years I worked as a part of a team of Supplax USA as a sales manager. During my work process, I used to close the objections through SMS and during the calls with our potential clients. In the process of my work in the company, I also sent several reviews about the work of our CRM system which was useful for all of my colleagues.
