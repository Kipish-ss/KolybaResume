I had to quickly learn new things and implement them into reality. During one working day, I fulfilled the obligations of several employees: I was engaged in pre-sales, analysis, studying the foreign market, export rules, training employees, translating scripts, instructions, and the website into English, etc. During her tenure, the department developed templates of letters for clients and introduced the Standard of Correspondence with Clients by Mail and Messengers.

sales manager,"Professional inbox invader with 4+ years of turning prospects into meetings.
A little about what I bring to the table:
--> Worked with a mix of ICPs across industries, company sizes, and locations — startups, SMBs, US, Europe… you name it.
--> Built outbound strategies and ICPs from scratch (because templates are great, but customization is king).
--> Deep-dive research on markets, industry trends, Tier 1 accounts, and contacts — yes, I’m that person who finds the CEO’s podcast interview from 2017 to use in an opener.
--> Lead list creation, contact research, and making sure send-out files are on point.
--> Developed and optimized messaging strategies to engage key decision-makers.
--> Managed outreach with tools like HubSpot, Reply, Apollo, Walaxy, LinkedHelper and more.
--> Built strong relationships through initial and follow-up communication, guiding prospects through the sales funnel.
--> Kept CRMs in check (because sales chaos is fun… until it isn’t).
--> Teamed up with marketing and sales to fine-tune lead gen strategies — two heads (or departments) are always better than one.
--> Constantly testing, tweaking, and improving — because what worked yesterday might not work tomorrow.
Main outreach channels: LinkedIn & email (not a big fan of Upwork).
Research tools: Sales Navigator, Crunchbase, and Google industry-related lists.
Data collection tools: Apollo, Snow.io, Amplemarket, Hunter, ZeroBounce.

I’m proud to have built my career across American, British, Spanish, and Ukrainian companies — gaining a global mindset, adaptability, and a deep understanding of real-world client needs.
In recent years, I’ve focused on the tech, driving full sales cycles and managing high-impact client relationships.

I specialize in consultative selling, trust-based relationships, and delivering value that lasts beyond the first sale.
Before entering tech, I built a solid foundation in hospitality, events, and international client service:
- At Mogotel, I managed corporate sales and events for business clients — sharpening my multitasking and ownership skills.
- At CGC (Crypto Games Conference), I oversaw international IT events and stakeholder coordination, managing remote teams and solving complex logistics challenges.
- Onboard TUI and Royal Caribbean Cruises, I worked in premium sales and creative production — building strong cross-cultural communication and service excellence under pressure.
Beyond work, I’m passionate about visual arts, portrait photography, music, and Formula 1. I bring creativity, empathy, and a curious mindset to everything I do — always learning, always growing.
I’m now looking to join a purpose-driven SaaS or service-based tech company with a strong mission and a human-first culture. Ideally, it’s a small or mid-size international team where I can contribute meaningfully, grow the business, and build long-term client value.
Let’s create something meaningful together.
- 110 closed deals in tech sales
- $1.9M+ in total revenue
- 1,054 discovery calls completed
- 400+ client-developer interviews facilitated
- Improved lead-to-interview conversion rate from 64% to 91%
- Worked with clients across the US, UK, EU, LATAM, and more
- When promoted to Senior Sales position at Company A, I increased the average weekly revenue from $2000 to $4500 through strategic upselling and relationship management.

I'm looking for a long-term collaboration, wanna be sure I am in the right ship with the right people"
sales manager,"I've been working in sales for the past 9 years. I worked in different fields from financial markets to web development. For the last 3 years, I've been working in a BPO business. My job is to close deals, sometimes help our agents pass their interviews with clients, and keep our clients satisfied. As well if the company wants to upsell I'm the guys they talk to about it. Right now I'm looking for a stable job in which I can grow financially and career-wise.
Why I would make a great sales manager? Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why.
First of all, I always get the job done, no matter what time it is or if I have to work extra. I'm result-oriented so leaving work exactly at 6 if I have calls later is not my style.
Second, I always try to find a win-win both for the company and the client. All of my conversations are friendly and I get straight to the point with the client so we don't waste each other's time. Only if I see that the client needs more small talk I would do that. But the main target that I have in my head is to close that person.
And lastly, I have a lot of experience in different fields which gives me an advantage over people that only worked in one. I can look at an issue or task from a different perspective and support it with my 7 years of experience working with the whole world.
Im really proud of that in every company im one of the best sales. I try to study the product and bring some new ideas that will eventually bring more money to the company. As well I lived abroad for more than 8 years. This gives me an advantage when talking to potential clients since I know how they think and what they need.
Im looking for a stable job that i can make a career out of. Product companies would be nice but if there are some amazing offers i will consider."

January 2025 - present
I am part of a team working on a smart bracelet for the military, athletes, and people with medical needs.

2024 - present
I conduct individual and group English classes. I work with students of all ages and levels.

Thanks to my experience in public speaking, I easily find a common language with people.
Co-owner of a cycling clothing store
2023 - 2025
Together with a friend, we opened a cycling clothing store. I was involved in promotion and customer service, as well as everything related to service. It gave me great experience in sales, dealing with objections, and building trust with customers. The business was local, but we were also active online.
About me.
I have well-developed public speaking skills: I have taken specialized courses, spoken in front of an audience, and participate in student initiatives.
I am a scholarship holder of the Karpinski Foundation in Stryi, which supports young leaders and innovators. I had the opportunity to communicate with successful entrepreneurs, including Taras Kitsmei, co-founder of SoftServe.
I like selling, finding an approach to people, and offering something that really has value.
I am a scholarship holder of Lviv Polytechnic for academic achievements in the IT Product Management major.
I took professional courses in public speaking and regularly speak in public, demonstrating confidence, energy and the ability to persuade.
I organized and taught English classes on my own, which helped me improve my planning, teaching, and communication skills.
At the age of 15, I became a co-owner of a local business that sold cycling clothes and launched online sales on my own.
I have an entrepreneurial mindset: I know how to generate ideas, test their value for the market, and work on their implementation.
I am preparing for the presentation of the Strix startup project as part of the educational accelerator: I am involved in developing a strategy, creating presentation materials, and training pitching skills.
I took part in student events with top Ukrainian entrepreneurs, and had the opportunity to personally communicate with Taras Kitsmei, co-founder of SoftServe.
I am constantly working on myself: I am studying C++, the basics of product management, marketing and sales in the IT sector.
I speak English at a good conversational level, which allows me to communicate freely with international clients.
I want to start a career in IT sales, where I can realize my strengths: communication skills, strategic thinking, and the ability to find a common language with people.
I am looking for a team that is ready to share experience and provide challenges that will help me grow professionally and personally.
I look forward to the opportunity to learn from experienced colleagues, work with real clients, and participate in the creation and sale of IT products that bring value.
I believe that I can become a strong player in the sales team and eventually a leader who understands both the product and the client.
I have an ambitious goal to build a successful career in the IT field, and in the future to create my own world-class company."
