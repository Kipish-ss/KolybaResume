This project focused on building an interactive dashboard for HR analytics using Tableau. The dashboard presents key metrics such as hiring trends, terminations, active employees, and demographic insights (age, gender, education). It also includes income analysis by department and a filterable table of employee records.
The main task was to transform a user story into a functional, user-friendly interface that supports decision-making in HR management.
Sales Dashboard

data analyst,"I have twelve years of work experience in construction, trade, and educational companies, including in management positions. My love for learning and exact sciences helped me choose my dream job - data analyst. My hardwork and dedication always energised the team in which I worked. My ability to see details and solve problems made work faster. And the ability to get along well with people made it possible to make lifelong friends.
I have work experience in data analytics only thanks to educational projects. For 6 months of studying at the Tech school GOIT, I had educational projects in Google Sheets, in SQL, in Tableau, in Looker Studio. All projects were about working with data and data visualization.
During the six-month study, she successfully created and defended works in

In Tableau
I learned to create functions and calculate the main product Revenue metrics, use filters and parameters. Built simple graphs and interactive dashboards, made five educational projects.
Throughout my life, I have always been a very responsible person. From childhood, I always made my bed, always did my school homework, and always listened to my parents and teachers. I graduated from a mathematical school with a gold medal, performed well at one of the most challenging higher education institutions in Kyiv, and was always an excellent worker. At 25, I got married and had three daughters. Since then, I could not dedicate enough time to my career. My family took up all my free time. Periodically, I worked at different companies. After a couple of years, when I felt I had learned all there was to know about the job and saw no further growth opportunities, I would get bored. And no matter how well I worked, my salary would not increase. Therefore, each job satisfied me, but not for long.
Without evil, there is no good.
On February 24, 2022, a terrible misfortune befell my country. The war divided my family. I had to leave my husband and take my younger daughters out of Ukraine. For more than a year now, I have been living in Ireland. The first six months were a difficult adaptation period, accepting my forced immigration. The next six months, I was treating Bell's palsy, as depression and stress affected not only my mental but also my physical health. The only thing that saved me was studying; I intensely focused on learning English. I spent two to five hours daily on learning. At the same time, I was looking for a job. However, the main condition was not to lose my health entirely. I realized that with my skills and experience, I could change my profession. For the first time in my life, I might have a chance to do my dream job—something involving calculations and continuous development. After all, I have loved mathematics all my life.
The world is changing with geometric progression. I realized that I have to work for more than twenty years. This is still a good piece of life. So, I decided to change my profession, where I will feel modern, where I will be interested and the work will be well-paid. I am ready to start even with an internship, where I will constantly learn and gain experience. Where I will have mentors, who will guide my knowledge in the right direction. When I get stronger in my new profession as a data analyst, I in parallel want to expand my knowledge by working with different tools. So that I could do my job and be confident in my professionalism. Because I am a perfectionist and it is important for me to be the best."

data analyst,"From October 2024 to April 2025, I studied at the Data Analytics course at GoIT, where I completed several projects: 1. Building pivot tables and creating a table for cohort analysis in MS Excel.
2. Writing SQL queries to create a sample with data and calculate CTR, CPC, CPM, ROMI on the corresponding date for the corresponding campaign.
3. Preparing data for building reports in BI systems, calculating conversions by date and traffic channels, comparing conversions between different landing pages in BigQuery.
4. ""Ecommerce funnel"" project. In this project, I created a dashboard in Tableau to analyze conversions in an online store. The results will help managers in the marketing department better understand how users move through different stages of the purchase and how their experience can be improved. The constructed charts and graphs will help businesses effectively monitor and analyze important metrics, which will allow them to optimize operations and increase profitability. 5. A project was implemented using Python in which the data in the Pandas DataFrame was first cleaned of duplicates and missing values. An additional DataFrame with extended data was attached. Application ratings were calculated. A graph of the total advertising costs was constructed. A box plot was constructed to determine the spread of daily ROMI in each campaign. A histogram was constructed with the distribution of ROMI values. A heat map of the correlation between all numerical indicators in the table was constructed. The indicators with the highest and lowest correlation were determined. A scatter plot with linear regression was constructed using the lmplot() function to visualize the relationship between the values. 6. A/B test project for a mobile application. Formulate hypotheses for the test. Select the audience and metrics for evaluating the test. Calculate the required sample size. Analyze and present the test results.
Develop a plan for further actions depending on the test results.
Built my own business from scratch. I have several of my own Pet projects in Tableau.

As part of this project, a public interactive dashboard was created in Tableau, which allowed for effective tracking of key market indicators. I also ensured regular data updates, which helped to keep the information up-to-date for monitoring and analysis.
At the same time, I decided to expand my skills in data analysis, and therefore additionally worked on various projects, including:
1. Analyzing the effectiveness of advertising campaigns:
I used PostgreSQL to aggregate data and calculate key metrics such as CPC, CPM, CTR, ROMI. This allowed us to identify opportunities for optimizing advertising campaigns on Facebook and Google Ads.
2. Analysis of user activity in mobile games:
Using Google Sheets, I calculated DAU, MAU metrics and analyzed user interaction, which allowed me to predict user retention and assess their level of engagement.
3. Analysis of user behavior in e-commerce:
I analyzed data using BigQuery and Google Analytics to study the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and improve conversions.
In all projects, my main role was to collect and prepare data for analysis, create visualizations and dashboards, and provide insights to make informed business decisions. I worked closely with other departments to integrate data into the overall decision-making process.
In the future, I am looking to deepen my knowledge in machine learning and big data analysis to become more effective in predicting and optimizing processes based on data. My goal is to become an expert in data analytics and help companies make fast and accurate decisions based on reliable data.

Have experience with several projects, e.g.
Analysis of the Effectiveness of Facebook and Google Advertising Campaigns in Looker Studio
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of advertising campaigns on the Facebook and Google platforms, using data from four tables. I created a CTE by joining the facebook_ads_ basic_daily, facebook_adset and facebook_campaign tables using a LEFT JOIN and joined them with the google_ads_basic_daily table using a UNION to get a single table with campaign information. Added a media_source column to display ad source and aggregate data by metrics: total spend, impressions, clicks, and total revenue. In Google Looker Studio, connected to PostgreSQL, I used a SQL query to generate a report where I calculated Ad Spend, CPC, CPM, CTR and ROMI metrics. For visualization, I built a combined chart with the sum of costs and ROMI by month, a line graph of the number of active campaigns and a table with heat maps to display the main metrics by campaign. For better analysis, I added filters by campaigns and the date of advertising.
User Activity and Cohort Analysis in Gaming
As a data analyst, my project was to analyze user activity and engagement metrics in the context of gaming based on data from two main sources: the activity table and the active users table. I calculated the key metrics of user age variability and engagement using DAU, WAU, Stickiness (DAU/WAU). Applied linear regression to predict DAU and WAU for future 20 weeks. Created several graphs to better understand the distribution of users and their activity: bar chart, pie chart and 2 combined charts. Built a pivot table to track early adopter retention. Implemented the following functions: IFS(), VLOOKUP(), MINIFS(), COUNTUNIQUEIFS(), AVERAGEIF(), FORECAST()... Using a pivot table and google sheets functions, I built two dynamic cohorts for user retention analysis. Applied conditional formatting to the given tables.
I have experience working as an Administrator at Restaurant Ti Amo from 2023 to 2024. During this period, I:
- utilized Excel for managing orders, financial accounting, work schedules, and personnel contacts.

data analyst,"I am a Data Analyst with a background in accounting. I am sure that my experience in the field of accounting can help me in my new profession, because it taught me to work with large amounts of numerical information, to count and analyze financial indicators, to always check and analyze incoming information and to react quickly to changes.
In the professional arsenal has both statistical and machine learning methodologies, thorough knowledge of two programming languages ​​(Python and SQL), two programs for working with tables (Google Sheets, Excel) and three basic programs for creating data visualizations (Tableau, Looker Studio, PowerBI). Also I know Amplitude analytics and Google Analytics 4 and how to conduct AB testing.
During my studies I completed several independent analytical projects, e.g.:
1. Analysis of advertising campaigns.
This project is focused on the analysis of Google and Facebook advertising campaigns. With the help of SQL queries, I extracted the information necessary for analysis from several tables in the database, and also calculated the main metrics for advertising evaluation (Amount of Ad Spend, CPC, CPM, CTR and ROMI). With the help of visualization in Looker Studio, the company's monthly advertising expenses were graphically displayed and the effectiveness of advertising companies was compared.
2.Analysis of revenues in SaaS.
This project focuses on revenue analysis in the SaaS industry. I researched the company's monthly revenue by product and user location, evaluated which software was the most profitable, and how the number of users changed over time. Also a new MRR was calculatedand a cohort analysis was conducted. My visualizations in Tableau help track a user's monthly progress in terms of revenue and measure conversion rates.
3. User conversion analysis
This project is built on Google Analytics 4 data. With the help of BigQuery queries, I investigated the conversion of users from the beginning of the session on the site to the addition of the product to the cart, to the attempt to complete the order and to the purchase by months. The metrics were then formatted using Google Sheets and fed into PowerBI. The final dashboard allows you to understand which advertising campaigns were the most successful and to investigate the change in conversion metrics during the studied period.
I want to develop and build a career in the field of data analytics, in the future I want to become a team leader  in a promising company.
In my current position, I consider my main achievement to be the swift transition to new responsibilities. This demonstrates my flexibility, adaptability, responsibility, and willingness to learn. I entered the field of accounting as a student who had a solid theoretical knowledge but little practical experience. Over the course of one year working as an accountant, I have learned a lot, worked in many areas, some of which are very challenging and responsible, and yet I have not made any serious mistakes or failures.
As for my achievements in data analytics, I am good and always on time with educational technical tasks, I have successfully completed several educational projects using different programming languages ​​and tools, such as SQL, Pyton, Google Sheets, BigQuery, Looker Studio and Tableau.

data analyst,"My greetings! I have a background in accounting, so I love numbers and everything related to them. I also like to learn something new. Here is a description of several of my projects in the field of Data Analytics.
Revenue metrics
The goal of the project is the development and implementation of a dashboard for the analysis of cash flows on the project. With its help, product managers will monitor the dynamics of changes in cash inflows and make a top-level analysis of the factors of these changes. Project managers will be able to use the dashboard to develop strategies and tactics aimed at increasing revenues and optimizing business processes. The dashboard includes metrics: MRR, Paid Users, ARPPU, New Paid Users, New MRR, Churned Users, Churn Rate, Churned revenue, Revenue churn rate, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, LT, LTV. The dashboard provides the ability to filter by date, user language and user age. The technology stack used: DBeaver (SQL-query) and Tableau (Dashboard).
Ecommerce funnel
The purpose of the project was to сreate a dashboard for analysis of conversions in the online store for managers in the marketing department. It helps to understand how users interact with the site from start to finish, as well as identify bottlenecks in the sales funnel.The data for this is in the public GA4 dataset in BigQuery. The main idea of ​the dashboard is that users can quickly see the main indicators and conversions of the store (in general and in key sections) and can also independently investigate conversions and determine how conversions change depending on groups of visitors and traffic sources.  The technology stack used: BigQuery (SQL-query) and Looker Studio (Dashboard).
These are some examples of my projects. Of course, there are many more of them and I constantly practice.
•	practical use of SQL, Python, Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Product Analysis;
•	creating projects in tools as DBeaver, Google Sheets, Google Analytics, Tableau, Amplitude.
Also, at my previous job, I managed to achieve:
•	preparation of financial, management and tax reporting;
•	developed a reporting system for business owners;
•	helped successfully implement new accounting software;
•	customer debt analysis;
•	optimization of tax payments, development of a tax planning strategy.
My main wish for today is remote work and practical application of SQL and Python."

Team project
Create a mind map for John von Achen's book ""Anything is Possible""
The team worked efficiently and successfully – all stages of the project were completed within the established deadlines.
Working in a team, each participant had the opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas, and then together, as a team, we found a common solution. The analysis of the book chapters was carried out according to a scheme agreed upon by the team. The team is grateful to the scrum master for his initiative and creative approach. When choosing a method of presenting information, we were guided by the convenience of visual perception, simplicity, conciseness and comprehensiveness – the information was presented and systematized in a form convenient for readers on the screen.
So, as a result, a mind map and presentation were created.
- Created interactive dashboards (e.g. in Looker, Tableau, Amplitude) to present learning outcomes
- Mastered and used SQL, Python, for data processing and analysis.

data analyst,"SpringApplication
This SpringCoreProject is an educational project. The main objectives include user registration, sending a token to the mail to confirm the email, display all users after sign in.
JPA Repository is primarily utilized for database interaction. Some methods involve JPQL queries. The services provide opportunities for sending messages to users, to register and search the users, to confirm the tokens (at the same time, it's worth noting, if user didn't pass the confirmation in within a certain number of minutes - the token becomes invalid).
In order to debug the code was added the logging and all log's information will be saved in a file. The services are working with entities, the controllers - with models, that's why before sending information to the controllers, entities are converted to DTO.
Web-controllers navigate between pages, perform checks, and pass information to the services for processing. The access to these controllers are passing via url using REST.
HTML documents display information to users: Thymeleaf is used for dynamic pages, JS and CSS with HTML are used for displaying the table of our entities. Spring Security, along with BCrypt encryption, ensures secure access, and Liquibase is employed for DDL and DML queries.
The application features comprehensive unit and integration test coverage. Profiles differentiate between H2DB (used in development) and PostgreSQL (used in production). Exception handling for user information is profile-dependent, based on the selected environment.
Project setup details, such as MailDev, Hibernate,Liquibase and DBMS, are specified in application*.yml files in the "" resources"" directory, depending on the selected profile.
Workflow
Create database in PostgreSQL DBMS
Change username and password in application-prod.yaml(PostgresSQL) or use application-dev.yaml(h2-console)
Add and run the MailDev in Docker ($ docker run -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev) ou use my shell script.
Run project
After the registration go to localhost:1080 and confirm the email.
Login in.
After authentication in Postman you get a permit for CRUD requests.

What I expect from the job
Willingness to learn and develop. Although I do not have practical experience yet, I am a quick learner and ready to actively acquire new skills.
Working in a team with a mentor. It is important for me to work alongside experienced professionals from whom I can learn. Working independently at the initial stage is difficult for me, so I am looking for an opportunity to be an assistant to a professional.
Flexible schedule, preferably remote. It is important to be able to work online or with a flexible schedule, which will help to effectively combine work and study.
Willingness to work for a minimum wage to gain experience. The key for me now is to gain practical skills, so I'm ready to start with a small salary if it gives me a chance to learn from professionals.
What I don't want:
1. Overtime work. I am responsible for my tasks and give 100% during working hours, but I am not ready to work overtime.
2. Independent work without support. Without experience, it is difficult to take responsibility for complex tasks right away, so I need a mentor or a team to work with.
I am looking for a company or team that is ready to invest in the training of a young specialist, and in turn, I am ready to make every effort to grow professionally."

My multilingual abilities (English, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, and German B2) have been particularly valuable when collaborating with international teams and stakeholders.
My most significant achievement was designing a MySQL database model that reduced query times by 30% while working as a Trainee Data Analyst. I've consistently delivered business impact through data - identifying that ""email + call"" was the most effective sales method and tracking metrics like ARPS ($9.28) and RPC ($93.62). Beyond technical skills, I received the Rector's Scholarship for academic excellence and built cross-functional expertise through international study at Radboud University and Hochschule Harz, including collaboration with Thyssenkrupp's Project Management team, which has strengthened my resilience and analytical thinking under pressure.
I'm looking for a role that leverages my combined strengths in data analysis, big data technologies, and languages. I want to work with complex datasets using tools like PySpark, Snowflake, and Google Cloud while applying my visualization skills in Tableau. I'm particularly interested in positions that value multilingual communication, as I can bridge technical and business conversations across five languages. I'd prefer to avoid roles that silo me into pure technical support without analytical growth opportunities - my experience at Genesis showed me how much I value being able to extract insights from data rather than just maintaining systems."

data analyst,"As a data analyst, I have hands-on experience working with large datasets, particularly in data visualization and analysis that supports businesses in making data-driven decisions. My expertise spans trend analysis, cohort building, and A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies. Here are a few examples of my projects:
REVENUE TRENDS AND COHORT ANALYSIS
In this project, I analyzed the revenue from new and existing users, as well as the dynamics of its changes over time. I built visualizations to track how users generate revenue after their first payment and assessed their activity in the following months. This helped identify trends of revenue growth or decline and analyze the effectiveness of different user cohorts. Through this approach, I was able to observe a stable distribution of users across all stages without significant anomalies, which indicates proper system configuration and process stability.
EVENTS ANALYSIS
In this project, I retrieve data on every user action to analyze how users behave on their journey from registration to making their first purchase on the website. Using Tableau, I visualize a funnel that shows how conversion rates and the number of users change at each stage of the tracking process. The project allows for tracking the dynamics of user registrations and evaluating how long it takes users to complete the setup. This helps to better understand user behavior and identify stages where users might lose interest or encounter issues.
A/B TESTING FOR SUBSCRIPTION PAGE DESIGN
The project involved conducting A/B testing to assess the effectiveness of a new subscription page design. I focused on data analysis and report creation using Python and libraries like SciPy for statistical testing (specifically, the Student's t test). Key conversion metrics were tracked through Google Analytics, and I used Matplotlib in Python to visualize the results. My contributions included hypothesis formulation, conversion analysis in different groups, and statistical interpretation of results, which showed a significant increase in conversions with the discounted version. I documented the entire process in a report format using Google Docs.
I successfully completed the Data Analytics course at GO IT, where I executed six projects, including one extensive final project that integrated all the knowledge and skills I acquired. Throughout these projects, I not only enhanced my technical skills in Python, SQL, and BI tools, but also learned how to effectively handle large datasets, create analytical reports, and visualize data to facilitate decision-making

I often work with such tools/technologies as Power Bi, Excel, R, GA4; I have basic Python and SQL skills and am working on improving them; I am starting to learn Google Bigquery.
In general, I want to work and develop in predictive analytics, statistics, and cloud technologies. In the more distant future, I would like to master machine learning. I am ready to learn new things and take initiative.
I'm at the beginning of my career, so I don't have many outstanding achievements, but I'm ready to share a few small ones from the last few months:
1) I adapted the first Google Bigquery project in our team and plan to scale its use.
2) Developed a unique data visualization for the finance team in R. Even bosses from Switzerland appreciated the work.
3) I created a cool user-friendlier design for one of the Power Bi dashboards. Its feature is that the user can compare data for 2 randomly selected periods of any length. The choice of periods is also visualized so that the user clearly understands what they are comparing.
Now I'm applying for a junior-level position, so it's important for me that the employer is ready to invest and develop people who join the team. I believe that a company should be human-centered, meaning that it should realize that it is the people who work there. I expect a company to be responsible towards people, and I guarantee responsibility on my part. The company must also be above reproach before the law."

In Tableau, we created a combined linear graph that displays both the total revenue amount and the percentage change in this revenue from month to month. This visualization not only highlights the scale of income but also illustrates the growth or decline rates. Additionally, we developed a table for cohort analysis of revenue from users, allowing us to track how revenue from each user group (cohort) evolves over time.
A cool project at Amplitude involved creating several visualizations based on a user cohort. These included:
- A user onboarding funnel.
- Daily conversions as users progress through the onboarding funnel.
- The average time users take to complete the onboarding process each day.
- The dynamics of user engagement in specific events.
- The average number of events each user participates in per day.
- A graph showing user retention from the Welcome event.
By analyzing these visualizations, you can gain insights into user behavior and formulate hypotheses, which highlights the value of Amplitude as a product.
