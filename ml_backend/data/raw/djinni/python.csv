python,"If you want to know about me more, this post is what you looking for…
To begin with, I start learning Python in April 2022, then I enrolled in Google course “Google IT Automation with Python”.
There are 6 course series, where I learned Basic Python coding, like lists, strings, dictionaries and so on. Then I interacted with Linux Operating System. After that, learned Git and GitHub and all about Version Control Systems. Next course was about Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques, where I found out a lot of errors and how to resolve them. Fifths course was about Google Cloud and how to configure VMs. And last but not least course was Real Tasks with modifying documents, images, post them in web pages with requests and create report to gmail account.
That was incredible! I really enjoyed learning all of these things and Python open for me such a cool world of programming).
In parallel I learned some libraries in Data Science, like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy. In my GitHub account I show my knowledge of these libraries.
Also, I create small interactive Detective Game. Where you will uncover interesting murder with small games.
And of course OOP. I have created Contact Book GUI by using Tkinter standard library. User can add, delete, rename and even add to favourites a contact. In this project I use all principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

First project - VPN company. We were moving their backend from Perl to Python. (It begun with reimplementing their PKI infrastructure, but they switched the task to backend migration).
I've got a chance to learn a bit about PKI and Certificates, DNS, Detection services. Partially rewrote some Perl package, that i could not find as part of Python ecosystem.
- ~7 months
- The second one was a company that worked with ads, which needed a software to recalculate bids by special algorithm  and update values on remote services through API, such as Ironsource. There was one another service(which i dont remember) which had slightly different API.
I made a CLI app for this purpose.
~ 2months
- the last was analytical service , we build backend from scratch. But there was already some work done in Go (Kafka event sourcing). I, personally worked on Python backend. Unfortunately we haven't launched till i worked there.

python,"• Introduction •
I've got over 10 years experience in IT and software development, and I've successfully delivered all sorts of challenging projects.
• Highlights •
— Development of comprehensive management systems (CRM, Billing, Admin Panels), significantly improving operational efficiency;
— Business process automation (bots, crawlers|parsers|scrapers, services integrations), resulting in noticeable cost savings and streamlined workflows;
— Design and implementation of scalable microservice architectures.
In Python, I've a little less than 10 years of experience developing server-side apps. I do it successfully, for most projects it is enough, and I'm satisfied with everything. However, when it comes to projects requiring the highest levels of performance and reliability, I find it reasonable to address potential bottlenecks or even develop the entire project using Rust.
• Focus •
I'm deeply committed to object-oriented design principles and design patterns, ensuring that my solutions are both flexible and scalable. I also prioritize thorough testing and documentation, applying unit and integration tests to guarantee application stability. My code is consistently supported by comprehensive technical documentation, making my solutions easy to maintain and extend.
Here are some of the main things I've achieved in software development:
— Development of a system for monitoring events in the system based on the created rules, parsing rules through the use of AST and specific processing for them. The system is similar to a truncated version of Grafana, but it also uses data and metrics from the InfluxDB for analysis;
— Development of a system for a financial organization to create, control long-term tasks (*.bat files) and monitor the result of running tasks. The system is similar to a truncated version of the Apache Airflow;
— Development a new billing system based on product needs;
— Integration of payment systems through their provided API;
— Enhancement and support of existing and new functionality of the admin panel of the project;
— Participated in the development of a Telegram bot for the Atlassian JIRA project management system. Using the Atlassian JIRA API, we managed to make a convenient tool for managing and monitoring tasks in the system from a regular mobile phone and messenger.
And also:
— Code coverage with unit and integration tests;
— Regular resolving issues related to tech debt;
— Participated in audit and refactoring process.
What would I want:
— Companies with a product approach;
— No outsource and|or outstaff;
— Use new technologies and the possibility of professional growth."

Шлях в розробці почався з написання ботів та парсерів, телеграм боти були створений у вигляді каталогів, зазвичай акційного товару. Наступною сходинкою став перший інтернет магазин написаний з використанням flask, Microsoft SQL Server, Jinja2. Після отриманого досвіду зміг опанувати Django за допомогою якого знов реалізувати інтернет магазин, під час розробки якого весь час щось перероблювалось з урахуванням нових знань та навичок. Багато часу пройшло, я можу не всі технології пригадати, але ви можете ознайомитися з проектом на GitHub. Що стосовно використаних технологій, це були дві бази данних, спочатку використовувалась SQLite3 потім перейшов до PostgreSQL, DRF(Django REST Framework), django-betterforms, FormSet, send_mail(з часом довелося перейти на повідомлення у термінал, так як Google ввів нові обмеження) Створене API з використанням DRF дозволяє як редагувати данні, при наявності прав доступу, так і переглядати дані про товар, колекції і тп, але якщо ви робите те саме з правами доступу рівня персоналу, або адміністрації, то отримуєте JSON з більшою кількістю данних, ну а також, як сказано вище - ви можете редагувати ці дані. Також були реалізовані різні варіанти авторизації(логін-пароль, токен). На деяких сторінках, в тому числі й на сторінці корзини товару був задіяний JavaScript(DOM), що дало змогу редагувати дані кошику - збільшувати/зменшувати кількість, а також видаляти товар. Данні кошику зберігались у cookies. Ближче до розміщенню проекта на GitHub я вирішив використати Docker та Docker-Compose так як ці технології дуже мене зацікавили в той час, та й здавалось, що це необхідно зробити для більшої цілостності опублікованого проекту. Після всіх основних робіт я взявся за оптимізацію з використанням Django Debug Toolbar та методів DjangoORM, особливо відмова від лінивих запитів місцями відіграла значну роль у оптимізації. Також проект був покритий Unit тестами.
Наступним проектом був API написаний з використанням таких технологій, як: FastAPI, RedisOM(ORM), PrintfulAPI, Pydantic, httpx, asyncio, pytest. Це був перший досвід з використанням NoSQL базами данних, та перший більш-менш серйозний досвід з асинхроностью.
Нещодавно ознайомився з курсом по AWS, та React. Маю на меті засвоїти отримані знання практикуючись при створенні онлайн-сервісу для маркетологів. Технологія наразі: mongoDB, FastApi, Motor, Pydantic, boto3, React.
Також мав невеликий досвід у розробці мобільних додатків, але поки не має часу розвиватись у цьому напрямку."

During my studying at the university I was working on my own projects like Pagink (social network written with Ruby on Rails and React.js) and QBlogs (blogging platform written with Flask). I also joined a team as a Ruby on Rails/Python developer with a project related to implementation of the barrier-free map of Kyiv during TechGround Hackathon held by Luxoft
During my studying for the master degree (2023-2024) I expanded my knowledge in computer science and applied them in my projects Locations (investigation of the performance different SQL schemas with PostgreSQL, Django, and Websockets) and Location 2.0 (similar investigation with use of FastAPI, Websockets as well as comparing performances of different schemas of NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Redis) that was furtherly presented as a scientific publication
I expect to satisfy my willing to make up and implement solutions with the code. With the background in both  development and automation I will be glad to become a member of the team and help the clients achieve their goals efficiently and quickly by providing relevant advices and high-quality solutions."

python,"I’ve had the chance to work on some pretty cool projects over the past few years, and I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished. At MinIO, where I’m currently a Software Engineer, I’ve been diving deep into cloud-native tech. One of my favorite projects this year was building a file upload scanner for the MinIO Subscription Network. It was all about making things more secure and compliant for enterprise users, which felt really impactful. I also worked on setting up monitoring for Kubernetes CSI-attached storage (DirectPV). Another fun task was automating UI testing for aistor using playwright; it boosted our test coverage and made the whole system more reliable, especially for the recent product addtition (Large language model). I’ve also led some architectural improvements for distributed systems, weaving in microservices best practices and tweaking API gateway configs with Gloo. Oh, and I got to enhance observability by setting up distributed tracing and real-time logging—seeing downtime drop and performance improve was a big win.
Before this, during my internship at MinIO, I got to design proof-of-concepts for big names like Intel and Tesla, tackling multi-cloud challenges. I also pitched in on the open-source side, fixing bugs and submitting pull requests to make the core product better. At Geobeyond, I built an API to simplify some tricky REGO stuff with OPAL and tied it into GeoJSON APIs.
Tech-wise, I’m pretty comfortable with a bunch of tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Istio, and eBPF for cloud-native stuff; Golang, Python, JavaScript, and a bit of Rust for coding; and then Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for infrastructure and monitoring. I’ve worked across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid setups, and I’m big on REST, GraphQL, and observability—think tracing, logging, and keeping microservices humming.
As for what I want to improve? Honestly, I’d love to get even better at Golang—it’s such a powerful language, and I’ve only scratched the surface. I also want to deepen my eBPF skills; it’s such a game-changer for performance tuning, and I think there’s more I can do with it. On the softer side, I’d like to work on explaining complex ideas more simply—sometimes I get so into the tech that I forget not everyone’s on the same wavelength!
The first is a centralized subscription management system that links all of a Nigerian user’s bank accounts using their BVN.
The second is an apartment rental platform that simplifies the hunt for a place to live.
I’ve recently wrapped up a project I’m particularly proud of: a system that tracks toxic gas emissions for companies. It not only monitors emissions in real time but also lets management calculate and pay their taxes based on the data."
python,"As a passionate Python developer with over a year of experience in Python 3.10+, Django, FastAPI and PostgreSQL, I love turning complex ideas into well-structured, efficient, and scalable applications. My web development journey has equipped me with strong skills in HTML, CSS, Django, and Docker, while I follow SOLID principles and design patterns to ensure my code is maintainable and efficient.
Creating RESTful APIs is a big part of what I do, and I've implemented everything from user creation and custom access levels to JWT for authentication. I take pride in solving data filtering challenges to ensure users see the right information at the right time, and I've developed custom actions to make HTTP requests smoother and more powerful.
Beyond the code, I love the challenge of integrating services like Stripe for payment systems or creating dynamic UIs like an image generator using tkinter and PIL. I’ve even had some fun building games like 'Space Invaders' with Pygame and developing bots for Telegram.
For me, coding isn’t just about the technical work — it’s about finding joy in the problem-solving process and constantly pushing myself to learn and grow. I’m driven by the desire to create solutions that not only work well but also bring value to users and clients.
Developed scalable RESTful APIs for both internal and client projects, supporting JWT authentication, user profiles, and access levels to ensure system security and flexibility. Optimized data filtering, resolving issues with incorrect data display, which improved data quality and enhanced the user experience. Integrated with Stripe to build a reliable payment system that processed over 500 transactions per month without errors. Created Telegram bots to automate communication processes, handle requests, and interact with users in real-time, reducing support team workload. Developed an image generator using tkinter and PIL, allowing for dynamic image creation and editing in real-time, boosting graphic handling efficiency in projects. Built a ""Space Invaders""-type game in Pygame, showcasing my skills in graphics, animation, and a strong understanding of event loops and user input handling.
I seek a team that values high code quality, professional growth, and transparent communication, where I can influence technical decisions and work on meaningful projects. I avoid a lack of focus on product quality and team development."

However, later things become more developmentish as I had experience working in a fintech startup, where you need to do everything. That everything was a unification of different web APIs of crypto exchanges into one and implementing different algorithms for trading.

python,"Hello!
My name is Zakhar and I'm a Python Developer.
My journey as a programmer began at university. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science. Defended the qualifying work for 95 points. Studied at Karazin Kharkiv National University.
I became interested in Python in the second year and engaged in self-improvement, also took courses from Udemy.
During the 4th year, I decided to go to the Mate Academy, where I received an excellent base for further improvement.
After Mate Academy, I got a job as a Python Developer at Codefinity, where I was partially engaged in development.
I combined work with the examination session, qualification work, and the military department, and was able to over-perform the goals set for me.
But ""partial development"" does not suit me, so I decided to fully immerse myself in Backend development.
I am currently looking for opportunities for further development.
In Meduzzen, I gained a better understanding of Docker, Docker Compose, and Docker Volumes, which opened up new opportunities for me to work with complex projects that consist of several services.
My goal: To become a Senior FullStack Developer and I know the weaknesses that I need to fill.
At school, I wrote an exam in 15 minutes for the maximum score. I am very proud of this. At the university, I managed to build a friendly team, where almost everyone began to help each other free of charge. I am very happy about this. I also consider my first projects made on Django and Django REST as achievements, because they are the basis on the way to a successful career.
Money is not my main goal as a developer. I am looking for self-improvement as a programmer. From the team, I expect an organized manager, colleagues with strong hard skills, and a positive atmosphere in the team.
""Came, sat out, took the money"" is not about me.
I want to join the project and be responsible for my activities."

python,"I worked both in the development team and myself.
Work experience yourself. I myself worked on mini-projects on Flask
and Django, wrote both the backend part and the frontend. The task was
set, I completely designed the project, selected frameworks and libraries,
databases, all the technologies that were needed to implement the task,
agreed with the customer, after writing the necessary edits, deployed to
Google Cloud or AWS (if the customer requested), usually all applications
and sites were packaged in Docker for the convenience of the customer
and deployment on any platform, documentation.
There were also tasks of crawling sites, receiving the necessary data
from sites both via API and when parsing HTML pages directly, mainly
using Scrappy and Beautyfullsoup.
Experience working in a team. The project on which I worked in the
team was the development of an application on a microservice
architecture. I used the Django rest framework, wrote the main structure
of the database, the structure of the application itself, and did a little work
on the frontend. I also containerized the application, and configured the
operation of all services for the application to run together in the cloud, as
well as documenting the code. The most difficult and most interesting part
in setting up the joint work of services was.

Wikis and Innovations: I will hesitate to ask the middle people, where the ability to deal with technical clicks is comparable to the ability to develop innovative solutions. I believe that the skin is difficult and there is a new opportunity for perfection.
Collective Work: I love the idea of collective work, where each team member brings his or her unique skills and approaches. I respect that interaction and exchange of ideas are key to achieving success.
Insight and Communication: It is important for me to have open communication in the team. I appreciate the opportunity to freely exchange thoughts and suggestions in order to quickly reach the optimal solutions.
Opportunities for Growth: I am always in search of possibilities for starting a Growth. You can participate in conferences, trainings and professional development programs. Ready to invest an hour and a half in improving your skills.
Friendly Work Middle: I think that the work middle will be friendly to creativity and productivity. It is important that the work environment stimulates effective work and promotes a positive team spirit.
Recognition and Evaluation of Results: I work with the team to ensure that the results and contribution of each participant are recognized and valued. I believe that mutual recognition has a positive impact on motivation and achievement of great goals.
My goal is not to achieve specific goals, but also to make a significant contribution to the long-term success of the team."

python,"Primarily in web development, but with a diverse range of complexities. Initially, I was involved in several startup projects at a bank, including their first payment terminal system at the time, where I worked with Perl.
Subsequently, I embarked on my own startup focused on programming education, utilizing technologies such as Python, Django, Postgresql, AWS, Docker, Redis, asyncio, twisted, and huey.
As a tech lead and full-stack developer, I contributed to the project, where I encountered a significant amount of legacy code. My role involved partially optimizing and improving the codebase, which significantly enhanced the project's performance over time. The technologies I worked with in this capacity included Python, Django, Celery, and Docker.
One of my most notable achievements was leading the development and optimization of a legacy project where I managed to increase the system's efficiency and performance by over 200%. This involved deep diving into existing code, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing modern technologies and methodologies, such as Django and Celery, to streamline operations.
Another achievement was the successful launch of my own startup focused on programming education. I developed the platform from the ground up, incorporating a range of technologies including Python, Django, and AWS. This platform has since been used by over 5,000 users worldwide, demonstrating its effectiveness and the demand for such educational tools.
Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the development of a first-of-its-kind payment terminal for a bank, which involved integrating Perl into the project. This terminal significantly improved the bank's payment processing capabilities and customer satisfaction.
These achievements are a testament to my technical skills, leadership capabilities, and commitment to delivering high-quality, impactful work.
I am looking for a role where I can continue to grow both professionally and personally. A position that challenges me and allows me to utilize my current skills while also pushing me to learn and adopt new technologies and methodologies.
A collaborative and supportive team culture is crucial for me. I believe that sharing knowledge and working closely with colleagues leads to the best outcomes."

My main task was to develop and test Python scripts to automate the operations of an autonomous forklift. I wrote code to process sensor data (like temperature or distance) to optimize its movement and avoid obstacles. I also worked on simple machine learning models using libraries like Scikit-learn to analyze data from hubs and switches, which improved the accuracy of the forklift’s autonomous functions.
Additionally, I handled data preparation: cleaning, structuring, and formatting it for model training. I collaborated with a team of engineers to integrate my scripts into the forklift’s system and documented the processes to make testing easier.
I’m an open-minded and eager-to-learn developer experience at a Polish robotics company, Inovatica Robotics, as a junior developer."

One of the most difficult projects related to React was an online school and it was necessary to make a board with many different types of tasks, and work with sockets, that is, the teacher had to see the student's board and what he was doing there, there was a group board and indicators for connecting students, and so the same ability to switch the teacher between students. Well, student grades, course progress, lessons, dictionaries, etc.
I led a project where we were developing a tool that could implement advertising on a website. The frontend was on React + AWS, and the backend was on Go. This is a very high-load project, because a huge number of products were advertised through this tool, especially on Black Friday and the New Year holidays.
DataDog and Sentry were used for data tracking.

I have tried many programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, and even NASM. But my first and favorite language is Python, so I decided to become a backend Python developer.
I'm also currently working as a junior Python developer at dZENcode. I perform a full range of tasks, including websites development using Django and FastAPI, as well as Telegram bots development using Aiogram. I also have experience working with high-load applications with an audience of more than 1 million users.
My greatest achievement is my project called ""Simple-XSS"". Simple-XSS is the most starred and viewed project on my GitHub, so it is probably most useful for other people. It’s also my favorite project because it has a very simple idea but at the same time unlimited possibilities. As soon as I have free time, I try to maintain and update it.
The main idea of Simple-XSS is to automate cross-site scripting attacks that can be useful for pentesters. The possibilities inherent in the simple concept of Simple-XSS are limitless and limited only by imagination. It's written using Python, and some popular libraries and frameworks such as Flet, Jinja2, Pydantic, WebSockets, and FastAPI. Also, Simple-XSS has two working modes, including a graphical and console interface, support for plugins, and complete separation of graphical and logical code, which simplifies its maintenance.

I like to learn new technical skills (languages, libraries, services, stacks, implementation approaches), improve existing ones - so I would be happy to get into a company / project where there are appropriate conditions.
I spent a lot of time on previous projects and companies participating in non-technical activities (such as estimating, management) - and I realized that I don't really like such activities. I do not refuse to fulfill them at all, but very often it turned out that I was required to allocate almost all my working and free time for non-technical duties - this was one of the reasons why I left my previous jobs."

python,"At Cartu Bank (May 2023 – Present), I played a key role in building secure APIs and background workers for external organizations such as the Revenue Agency and other financial institutions. These integrations ensured seamless, reliable, and highly secure data exchange between the bank and external entities.
As a Python Developer at MG Technology (Nov 2022 – Dec 2023), I have been involved in designing and optimizing software solutions using Python, Django, FastAPI, and Docker. My responsibilities include maintaining and improving server software, enhancing performance, and troubleshooting web application issues based on internal and external reports. I actively contribute to error analysis and software updates while collaborating with my team to implement improvements.
Previously, at Sweeft | A Making Science Company (Jan 2022 – Aug 2022), I developed functional web applications and engaged with clients to gather requirements and ensure optimal performance. I also contributed to maintaining and improving existing software systems.
I am looking for a role that offers opportunities for professional growth and skill development in a collaborative and innovative environment. I enjoy working on challenging projects that make an impact and value a company culture that promotes work-life balance. Additionally, I am open to relocation within the EU for the right opportunity.
On the other hand, I prefer to avoid work environments that feel stagnant and lack growth opportunities. Clear communication and teamwork are important to me, so I would not thrive in a setting with poor collaboration or constantly shifting goals. A healthy work-life balance is also essential."
python,"I'm a Python Developer with a year of experience who decided to move into the field of programming after a long-term interest in technology and a desire to create modern solutions. My path to this profession began with studying at the Python Developer course, where in 8 months I gained basic and advanced knowledge in web development.
During this time, I acquired the following hard skills: OOP, SOLID, Python 3.7+, Django ORM, Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, SQLite, HTML, CSS, Docker, Git/Github, FastAPI, and also developed such soft skills as: ability to solve problems, attention to detail, self-organization, teamwork skills, communication and the ability to take responsibility.
My background in physics (BSc and soon MSc) has always been closely related to analytics and logic, which naturally led me to programming. During my work as an online physics and mathematics tutor, I developed important skills such as attention to detail, responsibility and communication, which I now apply successfully in my work as a developer.
The first project on the way to a new profession was Restaurant Kitchen Service, developed on Django, which allowed me to deeply dive into the world of web development and understand how Python tools can help optimize business processes. The next step was to create a Theater Service using the Django REST Framework, which expanded my knowledge in creating APIs and working with databases. The third project, Library Service, allowed me to improve my skills in creating user interfaces and working with data.
The team project on the development of an online educational platform, where I collaborated with front-end developers, designers and testers, became especially valuable for me. This experience showed me the importance of teamwork, interaction between different departments and the importance of shared responsibility for the result.
The transition to programming became for me a logical continuation of my interest in technology, the desire for self-improvement and the desire to introduce innovations into real projects.
Passed the external examination in mathematics with 190
points, in Ukrainian language with 192 points, in physics
with 179 points
I study on a budget at Vasyl Stefanyk PNU, I have high
scores in key subjects, I regularly receive a scholarship for
high academic achievements
Developed and tested the methodology of using mobile
online applications for studying physics, presented
research at a student conference
Thanks to my training, students passed the NMT with 170+ points
As a Python Developer, I expect to work on diverse and interesting projects, contributing to the development of efficient applications while learning from experienced developers. I'm eager to explore new technologies, enhance my current skills, and continually grow in a dynamic and supportive environment."

About Me
Backend developer with over 3 years of commercial development experience. I write backend solutions using both asynchronous and synchronous Python 3.12. I am interested in improving the technical implementation of business processes, including integrating third-party services and projects into Bitrix24 via API. I have experience in team development and participation in writing technical specifications.
Work Experience
Skynet Telecom — Python Developer
May 2022 – Present
At Skynet Telecom, I hold the position of Backend Developer. My responsibilities include developing external services that receive webhooks from Bitrix24 and then validate the data according to client requirements (office). In most projects requiring integration between Bitrix24 and internal services, I assist by writing scripts or webhooks for ticket management.
I have led projects such as Planup, a Telegram bot for request creation, Localpay, and a Chatbot, while also actively participating in development and handling service deployment (including database migrations when necessary).
Business Process Automation
Developed and implemented business processes to automate interactions between departments (sales, coordination, and accounting), reducing data loss during transfers within areas of responsibility. Integrated projects into Bitrix24, enabling the company to more accurately track the growth statistics of its client base.
Project ""Planup""
Participated in the development of a CRM for field employees, integrated with Bitrix24. I developed a feature for creating and retrieving work orders from Bitrix24, which automatically determined which group of executors could view and execute them. Additionally, I implemented work templates that categorized tasks based on client (subscriber) requirements. My functionality automatically assigned orders to the appropriate template and executor group upon creation.I also configured a notification system for cases where a specific executor was assigned to an order and set up moderation rules to define interaction permissions (view/edit) in different areas. This eliminated the manual assignment of work orders, as the system could now automatically determine assignments based on location and region. The implementation of Planup saved the company up to $5,000 annually on licensing costs.
Telegram Bot for Application Creation
Developed a Telegram bot for freelance agents, enabling them to create tickets"

python,"Я розробляв складні системи, які інтегрувалися зі сторонніми API та автоматизували бізнес-процеси. Наприклад, у P2P маркетплейсі я створив бота для купівлі та продажу товарів, реалізував систему керування замовленнями та механізм оскарження угод. Завдяки чергам та кешуванню в Redis проект став працювати стабільніше й швидше, а користувачі отримували миттєві відповіді без навантаження на базу.
Автоматизація та парсинг – теж одна із моїх сильних сторін. Використовував Selenium, Pyppeteer, aiohttp, httpx для збору та обробки даних. В одному з проєктів потрібно було швидко отримувати інформацію з вебсайтів та інтегрувати її у систему – після переходу з синхрона на асинхронну обробку швидкість зросла на 20%.
Активно працював із реляційними базами даних (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3) та NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis). В одному з проєктів оптимізував SQL-запити та кешування, що дозволило зменшити навантаження на базу
У команді часто ставав містком між бекендом і фронтендом. Розробляв API, адаптував його під потреби фронту, тестував інтеграцію. Також займався моніторингом та логуванням: у одному з проєктів впровадив реальне логування через ELK-стек, що значно спростило відстеження проблем і покращило аналіз роботи сервісу.
Я люблю, коли системи працюють швидко, стабільно та без зайвих проблем. Тому одна з речей, якими я реально пишаюся – це оптимізація бекенду. Доводилося бачити API, яке повільно відповідає через неоптимальні запити або зайве навантаження на базу. Я такі речі виправляв -  чистив і переробляв запити, а в деяких випадках – переписував частину логіки. У результаті отримували швидший відгук API і зменшене навантаження на сервери.
Окрема тема – Telegram-боти. Я зробив і підтримував кілька проєктів, де ботам доводилося витримувати велику кількість запитів. Щоб вони не лягали під навантаженням, довелося грамотно використовувати черги, балансувати запити і продумувати архітектуру. Вийшли стабільні рішення, які працюють навіть при серйозному напливі користувачів.
Ще один момент – асинхронна обробка даних. Був досвід, коли парсер працював по-старому: все синхронно, довго і ресурсозатратно. Я перевів його на асинхронну архітектуру, і швидкість обробки зросла в рази. Те саме робив і в інших місцях: заміна asyncio.Task на Celery, правильне розподілення навантаження – все це давало відчутний результат.
Автоматизація теж грає велику роль. Якщо можна спростити деплой – я його спрощую. Якщо можна зробити CI/CD – роблю. Якщо можна винести сервіси в Docker, щоб їх було простіше масштабувати – це теж завжди плюс. Від цього виграють усі: і розробники, і продукт, і користувачі.
Ну і просто люблю, коли система не просто «працює», а працює правильно. Це коли немає зайвого навантаження, коли все логічно побудовано, коли моніторинг реально допомагає знаходити помилки, а не просто накопичує терабайти логів.
Головне – не боятися складних задач і вміти їх грамотно вирішувати. Це і роблю.
Як програміст, я шукаю можливості для вирішення цікавих та складних задач, де зможу застосувати свій досвід і розвиватися далі. Мене надихає робота, яка не лише вимагає технічних знань, але й дозволяє творчо підходити до вирішення проблем. Я люблю, коли проект має чітке бачення і мету, а також коли є можливість впливати на кінцевий результат.
Для мене важливий хороший колектив, де є підтримка та можливість обмінюватися досвідом. Спільна робота, коли кожен в команді може внести свій вклад і допомогти один одному, завжди приносить найкращі результати. Я ціную колег, які готові допомагати в складних ситуаціях, а також є відкритими до нових ідей та технологій.
Моя мета – постійно розвиватися як програміст. Я відкритий до нових технологій і готовий вивчати інструменти та методики, що дозволяють підвищити ефективність роботи. Важливо, щоб в команді була культура навчання, де кожен має змогу покращувати свої навички та вчитися від досвідчених колег"

python,"From fine-tuning language models to orchestrating chatbots that actually sound human, my work in NLP has been anything but dull. At a leading financial institution, I spearheaded the creation of internal and external chatbots based on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, helping to trim the call center backlog by a significant margin—because who wants to wade through endless phone menus, right?
To get these chatbots “talking,” I leaned heavily on Python, Transformers, and libraries that support advanced NLP pipelines. I also delved into workflow automation with AI-driven SQL agents—think of it as giving databases a little extra intelligence so they can handle tasks without constant human supervision. Meanwhile, ensuring data integrity is always front and center, thanks to various NLP checks and balances that keep the conversation flowing smoothly rather than veering into robotic-sounding territory.
On the side, I’ve ventured into a startup environment to build an AI-based chatbot from the ground up—an experience that’s taught me the art of juggling Docker, FastAPI, Redis, and PostgreSQL all at once, often while wearing multiple hats (and occasionally solving the “Why isn’t this code running at 2 AM?” riddle). While my focus these days is mostly on designing robust conversational AI, I still love the analytical aspect: turning data into visual insights, crafting meaningful reports, and keeping stakeholders in the loop so they can see how AI is actually making a difference.
As for what I want to improve, I’m aiming to dive deeper into advanced NLP frameworks and large-scale deployments, exploring more ways to keep chatbots sounding natural and data pipelines humming efficiently. When all is said and done, I’m most excited by the chance to mix creativity with cutting-edge technology—and sprinkle in just enough humor so even the chatbots don’t feel too robotic."

I made my own React project - a test version of a website with film recommendations. I took data about films from the themoviedb.org API. To transfer the necessary data between components, I used the React Redux Toolkit, the marshalling was built on react-router-dom, and pagination was also used. The whole project is fully structured, divided into logical folders and files, and everything is strictly counterparted with the use of Typescript.

python,"I have mostly worked as Python engineer with AI teams. My role in most recent project was to maintain the algorithm execution microservice as well as create a new one for feature extraction. I have worked with Celery application as well as back-end one.
When it comes to experiences, I have worked with various tools, so it's even hard now to mention all in my CV, but there are Flask/Sanic/fastapi, Kafka/NATS, Redis, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, gRPC/protobuf, sqlalchemy, Github Actions and a few smaller ones. I had very little experience with AWS in the career itself, so I've recently completed a course on Coursera and looking for a higher level courses and certification.
My usual workflow is to pack the microservices I develop into a docker container from which point further work is performed by devops.
1. Refactored extremely hard (code structure wise) C/C++ computer vision algorithm, while not breaking its logic. Several people had failed at this task prior to me;
2. Refactored around a thousand lines of code problems detected by pylint in about a week on a project I joined relatively recently.
3. Created a whole new feature extraction microservice in under a week sprint iteration time as the task was prioritized urgent.
4. Created a custom NER algorithm and improved it with genetic algorithm approach to match project requirements on NER execution time, while keeping high enough accuracy.
5. Successfully researched XGBoost algorithm to retrieve informative distance function between datapoints on a trained prediction model as well, as calculated pairwise feature importance on a trained model to better find dependance on multiple features.
One of things I avoid doing is joining or maintaining unproductive environment. So I strongly advocate for flexible and efficient pipelines to avoid creating blockers at first and perform on best level possible for the team and individuals.

python,"Greetings! My name is Oleg Zadneprovskyi. I am from Kharkiv, Ukraine. At the moment I'm looking for a job as a Junior python developer.
Last 6 month I have been working in the company as algotrading python developer for cryptocurrency trading. And before that I have been working 18 months in a commercial project and as a freelancer. I created backend, API using Django, FastAPI. In my free time, I write Python scripts to automate interaction with various web resources in the crypto market. I’m learning and practicing Python, SQL last two years.
I'm very motivated to take the position of Junior python developer and show my best side, to be a useful player in the team and in the product in general! I am a responsible, attentive, quick learner, with an analytical mindset.
My past experience. I have 10 years of experience in financial markets as a trader and data analyst. Excelled in analyzing and processing databases, identifying trends and patterns, as well as developing, testing, and automating trading algorithms and data visualization. I have well-developed communication skills, have conducted master classes, and worked with clients.
A trading arbitrage bot has been developed, as well as a trading bot for executing a quantitative strategy on cryptocurrency exchanges.
Hillel Reality Program (U-Help project, created REST API system using Django Rest Framework), Python courses, QA courses, ML and DS courses. I have been practicing python coding for over 2 years. Achievements at the previous place of work as a trader:
Analysis of the quotes database to identify effective patterns
Developing trading strategies
Maintaining reports for a group of traders
Risk management
Organizational issues
Results:
Developed and applied a medium-term algorithm based on historical quotes base for the last 5 years which exploits the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and simultaneously combines two timeframes of data for trading a portfolio of cryptocurrency instruments (not automated)
A bot was developed on the basis of a recorded database of a continuous stream of quotes from different sources, where events were detected on the divergence of price data at the same moment in time for one instrument. The bot performs spatial arbitrage (simultaneous trading with one instrument on two geographically distant cryptocurrency exchanges). At the peak discrepancies, identified using the standard deviation, one-time transactions on the instrument were executed.
An algorithm for trading a spread between two trading instruments has been developed based on processing a database of historical quotes for 5 or more years and the regularity of the existing correlation between ""related"" assets revealed in it. The search for the cointegration coefficient was carried out by means of EViews, which made it possible to bring a linear combination of two price charts to a predictable form.
I have expectations of interesting job offers for the junior position, where there will be a friendly team in which I could grow as a professional, be useful and share an experience."

I’ve optimized system performance by replacing legacy systems and removing obsolete services like Django-based components, ensuring more scalable and maintainable applications.
Before Juniper, I worked as a Senior Full-Stack Developer at Netrounds, leading front-end refactoring efforts using Angular and integrating Cisco UI Components. I played a critical role in the successful deployment of Netrounds’ Control Center in the world’s first cloud-native 5G network, utilizing Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Kafka to optimize network diagnostics.
My earlier work as a freelancer on Upwork involved delivering over 29 projects across various industries, maintaining a perfect client satisfaction rate. My projects included developing online marketplace platforms and real-time logistics management systems using React, Redux, Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I also handled containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and cloud deployments in AWS and on-premises environments.
Technologies I frequently work with include TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. I excel at working in Agile teams, improving system performance, and simplifying complex architectures.
I aim to continue developing scalable cloud-native applications, further refining my skills in DevOps and back-end performance optimization.
At Juniper Networks, I led the front-end migration from legacy systems to React, integrating Juniper's internal UI library. This improved responsiveness, performance, and UI consistency across network management applications. I was also responsible for refactoring back-end services by optimizing Python-based components, replacing outdated Django services, and reducing code complexity, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable architecture.
At Netrounds, I played a crucial role in enhancing the front-end of the Control Center using Angular and integrating Cisco UI Components, delivering a more intuitive user interface for network diagnostics. On the back end, I worked extensively with Python (Django, Flask) and PostgreSQL, improving database performance and ensuring reliable, large-scale data handling for network analytics. I also containerized key services using Docker, streamlining deployments in cloud-native and on-prem environments.
During my freelance career, I developed multiple full-stack solutions, including online marketplace platforms and real-time logistics systems. I utilized React, Redux, and Next.js on the front end to build dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js with NestJS for the back-end to handle business logic and API development. I integrated PostgreSQL for secure data storage, Redis for efficient caching, and Docker for smooth deployment.
Key technologies I’ve worked with include TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes. My expertise lies in building scalable, high-performance full-stack applications, focusing on clean architecture, smooth data flow, and responsive front-end design.
I aim to further enhance my skills in large-scale web application development using modern JavaScript and Python technologies, contributing to innovative, user-focused solutions.
I am seeking a role where I can leverage my expertise in full-stack development, working on innovative projects that allow me to contribute to both front-end (React, Next.js) and back-end (Django, Flask) development. I thrive in collaborative, Agile teams and aim to build scalable, high-performance applications. My ideal environment values technical growth, creativity, efficient processes, and offers fair compensation, with social benefits as a bonus.
What I’m looking for:
- Full-stack development with modern JS/TS and Python frameworks

Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery, Django channels, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLAlchemy, Redis, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, REST API, GraphQL, RPC, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud, CI&CD (Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Actions, CircleCI), Serverless Delivery (AWS Lambda, GC Functions), Git, Linux, etc.
And also, I have experience with Node, Typescript, Express.js as well.
Building a data migration tool was definitely one of the most interesting challenges that I tackled—the tool allowed users to migrate from one e-commerce provider (WooCommerce, Shopify, PrestaShop) to another. Because of the system's scalable architecture, the app migrated 1M products with orders, users, and image assets within minutes. In addition, the system was designed in a way that to allow run dozens of migration in parallel without any issue. And because of the tool's ""plug and play"" nature, adding support for new e-commerce providers required a few lines of code.
I want to work on a product and get to know all the ins and outs of the system to contribute more productively. I wouldn't enjoy building one-page applications or corporate websites."

model using a lighter version, ALBERT. This system allows real-time checks of
comments for meaningful content (to prevent spam and pointless messages) and
assesses the presence, level, and type of toxicity.
I held the position of Scrum Master and also worked on data preprocessing and
creating my own model version. I developed Docker and docker-compose files to
streamline the deployment and management of the project within a Docker
environment.

python,"I am interested in the position of a programmer to create new functions for data processing, database design and queries, etc. This year I have been improving my IT skills under the guidance of highly professional teachers and mentors in the field of IT and created my personal website for educational purposes, namely to check the level of English of students (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). The tests themselves, cognitive logic, educational practices and articles on the site fulfill my personal ideas and know-how. The development of the site required from me a full set of skills necessary for a full-stack developer from scratch to online deployment: Python 3.12, Django 5, PyCharm IDE, SQLite, JS, HTML, CSS, Jinja, database design and development, SQL,  Docker, etc. The site has the potential to be quite large-scale and is beyond the power of one solo developer, so I did my best and created basic material for testing students. Here is the link:

I have over 20 years of experience in Computer Science including working experience in Australia, Sydney (1999-2010), colleges as an IT trainer and I can work within the set deadlines and deliver all the assigned work tasks on time. I have learnt to prioritise my work from the most important to the least important and work closely with my colleagues in a team environment, helping each other when needed. I understand the importance of health and safety, equality towards gender and people with disabilities, business and behavioural ethics and have very good cultural awareness. I can manage and lead a team of employees to achieve goals, always planning my budget and aiming to be cost effective at all times. I can constructively roster the staff according to all the job requirements and any specific project according to the project management principles including the ability to delegate work to any team member professionally. I have outstanding interpersonal and communication skills and I always strive to use these outstanding skills for the benefit of the organization I represent.
- C1/C2 English level. IELTS certificate 8.0 out of 9.
- I developed and deployed my personal website for English students’ education purposes: 1) English testing (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2); 2) educational articles – guidance for students. The website has been in use for more than 7 years. It helps very accurately determine students’ English level, both before the beginning of the educational process and after its completion. And, also, the articles on the website help to quickly and fully answer students’ FAQ regarding their language education.
- I independently under supervision of my teachers and mentors have upgraded my IT knowledge in modern software development: Python, Django, PyCharm IDE, SQLite, JS, HTML, CSS, Jinja, DB design and development, SQL, Docker, Git, etc.
- More than 10 years working in Australia, Sydney, in IT departments at colleges and institutions as an IT trainer, I conducted lectures and practical classes for small and large group of students of all nationalities ranging from 7 to 40 people in a group; the number of teaching hours per week varied from 15 to 30 per week. The scope of teaching disciplines comprises OSs maintenance, GUI, software development, DB development, Office Suite, Project Management, Testing, Working in IT environment, etc.
- I composed 100+ assignments, including diploma projects assignments, IT courses curricula,  and assessed students’ diploma projects every year of my employment in Australia. Always have positive feedback from my students and colleagues.
- For a new opening IT college in Sydney, Australia, I developed a training package for the Network Security department, which was approved by the Australian Department of Education, NSW. As a result of my work, the college received a license for this course and was able to run the department to new students.

python,"Work experience:
Wanting to no longer have a commercial sense, I am actively engaged in the development of high-power projects and steadily improving my skills in programming. In my projects, I have used technologies such as Python for developing backend logic, SQL for working with databases.
Examples of projects:
- Data Analysis for Prediction: A project using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib libraries) to analyze datasets and build prediction models. This gave me a deeper understanding of working with data and machine learning algorithms.
- Task Management Web Application: Developed a simple task management web application using Flask (Python) on the backend and SQLite for data storage. This project helped me better understand REST API construction and client-server interaction.
Role in the team:

Development goal:
I am looking to develop into Python development and data analysis. I am interested in positions related to backend development, data processing and analysis, as well as API development. In the future, I see myself as part of a team where I can apply my skills and learn new things.
Achievement:
Analysis of large data sets and construction of predictive models:
In one of my projects, I analyzed a large set of data in order to build a sales forecasting model. Using Python and the libraries Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, it was possible to increase the accuracy of the prediction by 15% compared to the initial model. It taught me how to work efficiently with data and improve algorithms.
Development of a web application for task management:
Created a web application for personal use that allows you to manage and prioritize daily tasks. Used Flask for backend creation, SQLite for data storage and basic frontend technologies (HTML, CSS). It gave me an understanding of the basics of web development and building APIs.
Automation of routine processes:
Created a Python script to automate the processing and analysis of financial reports, which reduced the time to perform these tasks from several hours to a few minutes. This automation enabled the rapid generation of aggregated data for analysis, which helped in earlier work tasks.
Improving database skills:
In one of the training projects, I created and optimized a database to store user information using SQL. As a result, it was possible to reduce the time of execution of requests by 20% due to the optimization of the structure of tables and indexes.
Expectation:
I expect that my future work will allow me to develop as a Python developer and gain valuable experience in real projects. It is important for me to be able to work in a team where I can learn from more experienced colleagues and apply the acquired knowledge in practice. I look forward to interesting challenges that will help improve my skills in working with data, databases and web development.
Regarding career development, it is important for me to work in a company that supports professional growth, offers training and professional development. I am interested in participating in projects that have concrete value and impact business or user outcomes.

Customized chapter in django admin panel which allows to manage massive message sendings with third-party services and lead its statistics. This helped to increase productivity of stuff that managed this part functionality as well. Here I used full-stack technologies such as DRF, pure JS, jquery, jinja (django templates), Celery, PostgresQL, redis (as the celery broker).
An App which counts sales of supermarket network. It perform weekly reports of sales, income and tax. Also it counts remainders of each position (product) and shifts to the week with its actual price. Also here added functionality to form reports for product groups (suppliers) which shows every position of this group in each shop of the network of supermarkets in .xlsx format. To develop this app I used Djnago Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery.
In this project I added customized django template pages to the admin panel to represent these reports.
All data for these reports comes in files which are parsed to add sales and supplies.
More detailed experience described in my CV.
The most recent achevement is integration in django app big data tools such as HDFS and pyspark which helped to reduce pressure on main database (PostgreSQL) for performing analytical reports from millions rows of data.

python,"BASE OF PROGRAMMING
My eight-year and very diverse experience in programming started at school, where in addition to computer science classes I started to study game design. When I was a 7th or 8th grader I was writing JavaScript mods for Minecraft Pocket Edition. When I was a 9th grader I already won the 3rd place on Ukrainian stage of iTalent with the game I made and defended in the finals in Kiev.
In grade 10 I took 3rd place at the regional stage of mathematics in Dnepropetrovsk.
After 11th class I entered Krivoy Rog National University at the Faculty of Computer Science on budget. I'm currently working on a freelance job
PYTHON, OOP, API, PARSERS
I made Telegram bots and integrated api and implemented mechanisms that allowed to pay for goods and services through api qiwi and bitzlato while this service was still running. Also added possibility to pay via usdt just by direct transfer from any trc20 wallet. for this I needed to make a parser of the transactions in the required blockchain.
I made parsers that collected valuable information from various internet resources.
Also I made qr code generators with ability to put my logo in the center without losing/distorting information.
FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT
Any orders have been placed from simple functional to the entire online store with shopping cart, chat, user-friendly admin panel with individual features. Built my own sites for some time, later I managed to hire some helpers. Use jQuery and join-links that are initialized by both client and server based on their rationality.
In nodejs projects worked in a team with the frontend team (angular js)
Generated standard qr codes with different error correction level.
BACKEND WEB DEVELOPMENT
Dealt mostly with Python (4 y.), PHP (3 y.), NodeJs (1 y.).
Also created api in Python/PHP and wrote bots on webhooks.
I have been studying nodejs for the last half a year and have already implemented two projects:
- The site for editing exterior and interior photos using neural networks, recognition of objects in the photo and the ability to flexibly adjust specific areas in the photo
- High-performance business solution for Telegram - web application for administering channels, chat rooms, forums, publishing posts, creating newsletters and contests
I was working on loading components, implementing SPA, and transferring user information to the server.
I know how to administer Linux servers (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS). I am able to configure and adjust the server, as well as deploy python / javascript / php applications, databases, monitor the health of the server, set up self-service and automate actions of various kinds on Linux and Windows systems."

- Зокрема, робота з базами даних PostgreSQL. Переважно використовувалися Django ORM чи SQLAlchemy, але невеликий досвід з чистим SQL теж є.
- Написання автоматичних тестів (unittest, pytest, pytest-asyncio).
- Ведення документації у форматі OpenAPI (fka Swagger).
- Робота зі сторонніми API і сервісами (aws, google maps, APNs та іншими; іноді доводилося самому шукати і вибирати що використовувати).
- Участь у mutual code review.
- Ситауативна робота з AWS (оновлення CloudFormation templates, налаштування S3 як django storage backend, моніторинг логів у CloudWatch тощо), зміни в налаштуванні CI/CD.
- Таск-менеджмент у JIRA, моніторинг проблем у Sentry, робоча комунікація в Slack або Microsoft Teams.
Звик до автоматичного unit-тестування і CI/CD (якщо у вас чогось із цього немає - я налаштую)
English: можу брати участь у мітингах або проходити співбесіду
Виробив звичку оформляти невеликі git комміти, які легко читати на code review.
Переписав Dockerfile так, щоб білди робилися в мільйон разів швидше (layer caching).
Знайшов і виправив помилку у великому складному SQL запиті з JOIN'ами і вкладеними запитами.
Без попереднього досвіду з Gitlab налаштував багатокроковий розпаралелений CI/CD з автоматичним тестуванням (linting тощо) замість наївної ""лінійної"" схеми.
Хотілося б отримати більше досвіду із:
- FastAPI
- оптимізацією SQL, високонавантаженими сервісами
- security
- чим завгодно складним/цікавим чого я не знаю і чого зможу навчитися в процесі роботи
Погано підходжу для ролі Full-stack (краще найміть мене на part-time і візьміть окремого front-end розробника; одна голова добре, а дві краще)
Охоче візьму обов'язки devops, якщо мені пояснять що робити або дадуть час самому розібратися.
Побажання до рекрутера:
- надішліть опис хоча б однієї з доступних вакансій, я одразу відповім за якими вимогами підходжу, а за якими ні;
- прочитайте секцію About у LinkedIn - додаю туди відповіді на часті питання;
- дозволяю телефонувати без попередньої домовленості; у найгіршому випадку просто не відповім :)
Сильніше захочу працювати з компанією, якщо ви:
- маєте контракт без бюрократичних пасток (бажано короткий) і надсилаєте примірник разом з офером, а не в перший робочий день
- на технічному інтерв'ю не запитуєте нудні визначення з підручника
- не вимагаєте ""домашнє завдання"" на 4-6 годин за шанс потрапити на співбесіду (але я не проти якщо на тестове вистачить 1-2 годин чи якщо результат можна буде показати іншим роботодавцям)
- наймаєте на part-time з погодинною оплатою
Сильніше захочу працювати в команді, якщо вона:
- практикує mutual code review або інші способи обміну досвідом (я завжди намагаюся розібратися в інструменті так, щоб уміти передати знання іншим)
- вимоглива до якості роботи
- любить UNIX, GNU/Linux та Free/Libre Open Source Software
- любить настільні чи кооперативні ігри :)"

python,"I worked on developing a news chatbot from the very beginning of the project. At the initial stage, I created the bot's menu using the aiogram library. As the menu functionality expanded, I learned to use the aiogram-dialog library and completely migrated the menu to its framework.
After other developers left the project, I resolved issues with the database by optimizing its operation through a context manager (with). Additionally, I addressed problems with asynchronous code by splitting it into multiple threads to ensure proper execution.
Currently, I continue to develop the bot and assist new developers in quickly adapting to the project. This experience has helped me deepen my understanding of Python development, improve my skills in asynchronous programming, database management, and team collaboration.
Development of a Functional Menu: Successfully created and expanded the menu for a news chatbot using the aiogram and aiogram-dialog libraries.
Database Optimization: Resolved critical bugs in database operations by transitioning to a context manager (with), ensuring stability and efficiency.
Improved Asynchronous Processing: Addressed issues with asynchronous code by reorganizing it into multiple threads, significantly enhancing the bot’s performance.
Implementation of New Technologies: Quickly mastered the aiogram-dialog library, enabling the integration of more complex and flexible functionalities into the bot.
Team Support: Assisted new developers in adapting to the project by sharing knowledge and ensuring the continuity of development.
Independent Development: Successfully continued the project’s development after other team members left, ensuring its stable operation and further improvement.
One of the tasks I worked on was optimizing API and news generation code after a developer left the project. The asynchronous calls caused the code to hang. I analyzed the architecture, refactored the logic into two threads, stabilized functionality, and prepared the project for release, completing deployment on Azure. This enhanced my expertise in multithreading, asynchronous processing, and CI/CD.
Expectations from a new job:
Opportunities for Growth: I want to work on engaging projects that allow me to enhance my programming skills, particularly in Python, while also exploring new technologies and tools.
Clear Goals and Transparency: I expect well-defined tasks and transparent communication within the team.
Professional Development: Collaboration with experienced colleagues to exchange knowledge and gain opportunities for career advancement.
Work-Life Balance: I value a company that supports a healthy balance between work and personal life.
Impactful Contribution: I seek opportunities to influence decisions within my area of responsibility and propose ideas to improve the product.
What I want to avoid:
Projects with unclear objectives and no deadlines.
Constant firefighting and lack of proper planning.
Limited access to learning and development resources.
A toxic work environment or negative team dynamics.
Lack of prospects for professional growth."

python,"Я Python-розробник із досвідом створення RESTful API та веб-застосунків за допомогою Django, Django REST Framework і FastAPI. Мій досвід охоплює чотири проєкти: два індивідуальні та два командні.
В індивідуальних проєктах я розробив систему управління театрами та систему управління ресторанною кухнею з аутентифікацією користувачів, системою бронювання та налаштуванням деплою.
У командних проєктах я працював над системою управління бібліотекою та сервісом управління фільмами.
У бібліотечному сервісі я реалізував JWT-аутентифікацію та написав тести з покриттям у 92%. Система підтримує Stripe-платежі та Telegram-сповіщення для користувачів.
У проєкті Movie API я розробив систему кошика покупок із використанням async/await у FastAPI. Увесь проєкт побудований на повністю асинхронній архітектурі для підвищення продуктивності.
Я постійно навчаюся і відкритий до нових технологій та підходів у розробці.
Технології, з якими я працюю:
Мови та фреймворки: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI (асинхронне програмування)

python,"I have experience working in a Scrum team, where we developed a language learning application called Recallingo. The app is focused on spaced repetition and helps users memorize words in multiple languages more effectively.
During the development process, we used GitLab for version control and CI/CD pipelines, which allowed for smooth collaboration and efficient project management. I'm familiar with both GitLab and GitHub environments.
My main stack is Python and Django, and I’ve built several backend systems with RESTful APIs, integrated third-party services, and worked extensively with databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite. I also have some hands-on experience with JavaScript, primarily for frontend functionality in full-stack projects.
Additionally, I’ve worked with Docker to containerize applications, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. I'm comfortable with designing and consuming APIs, setting up database schemas, and building scalable backend services.

python,"1. B2B/B2C services with high-volume API interactions
- Played a key role in transforming the B2B/B2C services by addressing the complexity of managing over 80 different API configurations. The existing solution was cumbersome, requiring frequent server restarts for every configuration change, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and a significant slowdown in operational activity. I proposed and developed a custom configuration management tool that automated the configuration process across various API environments. This tool, designed for flexibility, enables the seamless management of API keys, flags, URLs and other configuration elements. The solution was approved and successfully implemented, significantly reducing operational overhead and improving the management of different external APIs.
- The legacy system struggled with inconsistent data handling and frequent failures, which resulted in significant operational challenges and inefficiencies. These issues led to operational disruptions and considerable downtime, affecting team productivity. I designed and implemented a new solution using cron jobs that optimized the handling of approximately 300K requests per day to external services.  As a result, operational issues were significantly reduced, leading to a 99% decrease in complaints from the operational team. The new system now consistently delivers timely, accurate data, enhancing the overall reliability of the operations.
- I designed and implemented a standardized data conversion layer to handle currency data across multiple systems. As the platform interacted with various external systems and APIs, each requiring different data formats, the existing approach became increasingly difficult to maintain. Financial data required custom conversion logic for each API, which led to fragmented and non-maintainable data handling across the system. This resulted in duplicated efforts and a growing complexity. To resolve this, I created a centralized data conversion layer that unified the handling of currency data. This layer allowed easy configuration through customizable settings, enabling consistent data conversion and calculations across all interactions with external APIs. This approach improved maintainability and reduce complexity, enabling easier updates and scale.

python,"With a lot of experience in creating and maintaining documentation projects where I
contributed content, research, and code; good at solving complex tasks that
require deep analysis, non-trivial approaches, or solutions that go beyond the realm of
documentation.
The best fit for my skills and experience is where:
• Documentation needs to be created from scratch
• The accumulated information needs to be organized
• The available documentation solution and related workflows need to be optimized
1. Single source documentation platform that serves both technical and business users, securely stores implementation details, totally isolated client documentation
1. Documentation specific search engine
1. Server side logic that generates at runtime additional navigation based on content and requires no configuration.
1. Consistent conventions that enable the documentation to scale as a system, facilitate search, work as input for AI.
For quite some time, I've been researching and implementing AI in my workflows - I found my technical writing skills to be a great benefit when it comes to designing agents. It would be awesome to participate in an ambitious project that goes beyond 'just having some docs' but values documentation as a powerful companion."
