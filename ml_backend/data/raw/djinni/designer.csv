designer,"Hi there!
I’m Iryna, a UX/UI designer with a background in statistics and data analysis — and a real passion for creating thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences.
My path into design was built on a strong analytical foundation. Before working as a designer, I spent several years in fields where attention to detail, structured thinking, and understanding human behavior were key. This helps me approach design challenges not just creatively, but also with clarity and logic.
In my work, I focus on crafting interfaces that feel intuitive and genuinely solve users’ problems. I’ve had the opportunity to design:
a fitness app that supports healthy habits through clear tracking and motivational visuals,
a finance management platform where usability directly impacts how people manage real money,
and several websites where I helped small businesses improve engagement and increase conversions through smart UI decisions.
Beyond design skills, I bring strong research experience: I’ve conducted over 2,000 interviews and surveys, which taught me how to ask the right questions, identify patterns in user behavior, and turn feedback into improvements. One data-backed change even led to a 15% increase in user satisfaction.
What sets me apart?
I’m confident with tools like Figma, Sketch, Illustrator, and even Webflow for building out designs.
I have a technical education in statistics and economics, which supports my data-driven mindset.
And I genuinely love the process — from research and discovery to testing and iteration.
I’m a curious learner, a solid team player, and I’m not afraid to speak up (even in English ). I believe that humor, honesty, and empathy go a long way in building both products and teams.

My first steps in design began with studying fashion design and construction. My journey in graphic design began in 2019, when I took the Vitalii Valkov's Graphic Design course. The skills from the course helped me start freelancing, making logos, designing bottles, designing certificates, etc. It was difficult for me to find a job because I had little experience, so I started studying illustration. I fell in love with these courses right away, we learned to work with composition, shapes, characters, colors, and in the end I made my first illustration book! After completing the second year, I got a job in the gambling industry, where all my skills were needed, because I did marketing tasks, designing postcards, stickers, drew illustrations and a little bit of info graphics, but most of all there were technical tasks that I liked no less and it was an interesting task to combine all this. So, to conclude the description of myself, I will say that I do not stop at my acquired skills and am currently studying a new branch of ux/ui."

designer,"Work Experience
As a Product Designer with experience across FinTech, SaaS, and TravelTech, I've led design projects that range from building digital solutions from scratch to redesigning complex systems.
In my recent role as Lead Product Designer at Mobilo Card, I spearheaded the redesign of the app, desktop interface, and management platform to enhance user experience and performance for both B2B and B2C clients. I implemented a unified design system that strengthened brand consistency and simplified user training, successfully overcoming technical challenges using Figma.
Previously, as a Senior Product Designer at Placemate, I developed web and mobile solutions for coworking space platforms, building dashboards to manage bookings, track employee activities, and handle payments. This role involved designing for three distinct user types: individuals, coworking spaces, and corporate clients.
At Sosivio, I optimized the platform for development and testing workflows, introduced new widgets to improve efficiency, and established a cohesive visual design to streamline user interactions.
Technologies and Skills:
Tools: Figma, prototyping, and interactive mockups
Research: User interviews, usability testing, A/B testing
Design: User flows, information architecture, interaction design
Collaboration: Cross-functional team work with developers and stakeholders
Goals
I'm focused on continuous growth, exploring new tools and methodologies to refine user-centered design and improve digital product efficiency and aesthetics.
Accomplishments
Enhanced Brand Consistency & Usability: At Mobilo Card, I led a complete redesign that included the app, desktop platform, and management system. The new design system improved brand cohesion and reduced the need for user training, resulting in fewer support requests.
Improved User Experience Across User Types: At Placemate, I created solutions that served three unique user groups—individuals, coworking spaces, and corporate clients. This design approach simplified navigation and improved booking and payment management for all users.
Optimized Development & Testing Workflows: At Sosivio, I restructured the platform to streamline software testing and development, adding functional widgets and intuitive navigation that increased efficiency for B2B clients.
Supported Corporate Scalability: Designed scalable solutions for large enterprises, enabling them to effectively manage complex systems with thousands of users, from small teams to enterprise-level implementations.
What I’m Looking For: A role where I can take on meaningful projects, either building products from scratch or fully redesigning existing ones. I’m especially interested in working on apps, platforms, and dashboards in complex fields like FinTech, SaaS, and HealthTech, with a focus on creating intuitive, user-centric solutions. I value collaborative teams that prioritize clear communication, continuous improvement, and high-quality design.
What I’d Like to Avoid: I’m not interested in projects that feel overly repetitive, such as endless website templates or e-commerce projects with minimal creativity. I prefer environments that embrace innovation and respect the designer’s role in shaping the product's success, rather than quick fixes or compromising on design quality."
designer,"For nearly 10 years, I worked at an oil company, progressing from the accounting department to the financial department. This role demanded resilience, attention to detail, and effective client communication, often juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, including analytical work, document processing, and coordinating with oil depots.
However, despite a successful career in finance, I realized that my true calling was design. With determination and a desire to “live my best life,” I transitioned into the creative field, where I found genuine fulfillment in graphic design.
Over the past 4 years of freelancing graphic design and 1,5 years of freelancing UX/UI design, I have collaborated with businesses across various industries, managing projects from initial market research to full design implementation:
• Logos and branding
• Identity and print materials
• Digital content: presentations, web graphics, and social media assets
• Web design in Figma, including handover to developers
My work is always based on an individual approach to each client, detailed analysis, and a well-thought-out creative strategy. I am proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma and am actively developing my skills in After Effects to add motion design to my expertise.
Today, I aspire to join a team of professionals where I can grow, exchange ideas, and implement projects at the highest level. I am confident that my experience, enthusiasm, and ability to generate unique ideas will contribute to achieving exceptional results.
I have experience in creating logos, logobooks, guides and developing printed materials of various designs. I prepare presentations and layouts for printing with high quality and creativity standards. At the end of the course, I was recognised as the best student at the European Design School.
During my studies, I had two fairly good UX/UI design projects, one of which was the development of a web service, which is on the list of the best works.
Expectations from the job
1. Creative atmosphere and team support
I expect to work in a team of like-minded individuals where everyone can freely express their ideas, exchange experiences, and achieve high results together. It is important to feel supported by colleagues and leadership at every stage of the work.
2. Opportunities for professional growth and development
I strive to continuously improve my skills and expand my creative horizons. I expect the new job to provide opportunities for learning, mastering new tools, and advancing my qualifications, especially in the field of motion design and animation.
3. Variety of projects
I am interested in working on various types of projects, from branding to web design, and bringing my ideas to life. I expect the job to provide opportunities to develop in different areas of design and take on new and exciting tasks.
4. Inspiring tasks
I want to work on projects that will not only be challenging but also inspiring. It is important that my work has a positive impact on the brand and business of clients, while also reflecting my creative ambitions.
5. Clear planning and organization of work
I expect well-organized workflows where tasks and deadlines are clear, and each stage of the project has a structured approach. This will allow me to work effectively, avoid stressful situations, and deliver the best results.
6. Flexibility and the possibility of remote work
Since I am used to a flexible schedule and a free working style, the possibility of working in comfortable conditions and having the option for remote work is important to me.
I avoid routine tasks without the opportunity for creative expression or personal growth. I don't want to work in an environment where my work is not valued or where there is a lack of mutual support and recognition of my efforts.I don't want to be limited in the use of creative tools or access to the necessary resources to work on projects. I avoid teams where there is a conflicting or negative atmosphere that prevents me from working productively and collaborating with colleagues."

designer,"Having initially started my career as an English-language copywriter almost 10 years ago, I gradually transformed into a graphic designer and then into UX/UI design. Throughout my freelance career, I have worked with both small private clients and large companies.
For the last 4+ years I have been a designer for a Swiss startup called Alp (the first two years were full time, the last two years are part time). I developed the interface from scratch for both the mobile version of the application and the web. During this time, we encountered a bunch of problems and product transformations, which, of course, increased my professional experience. At Alp, inc. my work often went beyond UX/UI and included both product design elements (more complex and product-shaping solutions) and graphic design (branding, presentations, etc.). Now the tool is rapidly gaining popularity and bringing its owners their first profit.
My second permanent project for the last 3 years has been working at the mSIGNIA company, where I work on the redesign of a tool for testing payment transactions called PaySim. The company, like its tool, is one of the leaders in the field of testing payment transactions. The tool that I design is used by such industry giants as Mastercard, Arcot, Moneris and hundreds of banks and payment systems around the world.
In addition to this, I also designed an internal communication and corporate file sharing tool for AbInBev (the largest beer manufacturer in the world). I was also part of a large award-winning Ukrainian design agency called Etcetera for more than a year.
After my redesign of the PaySim tool, it reached the point of self-sufficiency for the first time. Now it is one of the market leaders.
The Alp app was initially financed from the owner’s personal budget and now the application brings him profit. Our plans include achieving self-sufficiency by autumn 2025.
I'm looking for a product where I can apply my many years of experience and expand my knowledge base. It could be either a mobile app or a web tool.

designer,"Worked on a startup as a mobile app designer — created prototypes, thought through user flows, and shaped the overall visual style. I love those moments when a simple sketch turns into something real, intuitive, and beautiful.
I have experience in UI/UX design: from wireframes and user flows to polished mockups and presentations. I also work with graphics, typography, and color — for me, it’s important that design not only looks good but also feels right and makes sense.
I follow modern design trends but don’t chase them blindly — I aim to find the balance between aesthetics and functionality. I often try to put myself in the user’s shoes, and that really helps me build more thoughtful and user-friendly solutions.
I enjoy collaborating with a team, throwing ideas around, testing things, learning from mistakes, and finding cool insights. I believe good design starts with the question “Why like this?” and ends with “Because I can’t imagine it any other way.”
What I’m looking for:
– A collaborative team with clear processes, where feedback is valued and there’s room to grow.
– The opportunity to have an impact on the product, suggest and implement my own ideas.
– Realistic deadlines and an understanding that good design takes time.
– A culture of respect, open communication, and support.
What I’d rather avoid:
– Making 100500 edits just because “the boss doesn’t like yellow.”
– Working in chaos without structure, priorities, or clear tasks.
– Being the only designer in the company without any support or feedback."
