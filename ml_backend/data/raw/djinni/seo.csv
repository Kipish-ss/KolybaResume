seo,"Experienced SEO specialist with a diverse background across agency, in-house, and freelance roles. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects targeting markets in the US, Latin America, EU, Ukraine, and Central Asia, covering a wide range of industries including IT, SaaS, eCommerce, and local services.
My experience spans full-cycle SEO — from audits and strategy development to hands-on execution and performance tracking. I've worked with both large-scale platforms (1M+ indexed pages) and niche websites, helping them grow traffic, improve technical performance, and boost conversions.
Highlights of my expertise include:

- Cross-functional collaboration with design, dev, and content teams to integrate SEO into broader product and marketing workflows.
- Hands-on experience in international SEO, with a focus on localizing strategies for Latin American and European markets.
I’m currently focused on finding a full-time role within a product team, where I can contribute to long-term growth and fully leverage my strategic and technical SEO expertise.
That said, if you're a business looking to start benefiting from search engine optimization — feel free to reach out. I can help you identify the right starting point and build an effective strategy that aligns with your goals and budget.
While I can't share all the details of my project achievements publicly, I'd be happy to discuss them in more depth during an interview.
Here are some selected highlights from my work across competitive and technically complex projects:

seo,"Організувала контент-команду з нуля, включаючи створення структури робочих процесів та гайдлайнів для різних типів матеріалів (новини, огляди, гайди). Також створила окрему команду райтерів з різних гео (EN, ES, DE, PL та ін.), які пишуть для кількох iGaming-проєктів одночасно. Забезпечую координацію між командами, контроль якості контенту та його відповідність SEO-вимогам.
Розробила ефективний механізм перевірки контенту та надання зворотного зв’язку райтерам, який значно покращив якість текстів та спростив комунікацію.
Зокрема:
•	Створила детальні гайдлайни для кожного типу контенту (онлайн-казино, ставки на спорт, огляди ігор, слоти), які включають чіткі вимоги щодо стилю, структури, тону, SEO-елементів і редакційних стандартів
•	Побудувала систему редагування, в якій фідбек до текстів базується на посиланнях на відповідні пункти в гайдлайні, а не на суб’єктивних оцінках
•	Такий підхід зменшив кількість повторних правок, унеможливив упередженість і зняв напругу в команді, бо всі автори розуміють очікування ще до написання тексту
•	У результаті зросла ефективність роботи команди, і нові райтери швидше адаптуються до стилю проєкту.
Шукаю позицію, де можна не лише редагувати, але й брати участь у створенні контент-стратегії, гайдлайнів, формуванні команди редакторів і райтерів та впровадженні нових підходів. Також готова до того, щоб очолити команду редакторів."

Projects are targeted to the US market as well as UK, Poland, Brazil, Latvia, etc. It gives me the expertise in managing highly demanding SERPs with a lot of competitors. In this position, I'm managing link builders, developers, and copywriters, assigning relevant tasks, checking for the correct implementation, and complying with deadlines.
In my previous company, I was an in-house SEO specialist. Also managed several various projects (B2C ecomm, building & design content website).

Services I work with and use every day:

- Ahrefs, Serpstat, Semrush, Keycollector
- Google Search Console, Google Analytics

- Grammarly and LanguageTool to avoid mistakes in clients' documentation
English skills:

Managed the process of creating a site from scratch. Created the structure based on keyword research, design, blocks of automatic linking, metadata templates. In the process, I established contact with the development team so that the site exactly met all my requirements.
Independently led 4 projects in the agency (at the same time). Found a global critical issue with non-unique content and query cannibalization across multiple sites in the grid. I went over the site structures myself, created redirect maps, optimized pages with unique content and made content briefs for new text pieces."

seo,"Маю понад 5 років досвіду в сфері SEO та займаю позицію Senior SEO Specialist з глибоким фокусом на розробку стратегій просування. Протягом кар'єри працював з різними проєктами — від середніх бізнесів до великих e-commerce, контентних порталів і B2B-напрямків. В моїй зоні відповідальності завжди були повний цикл SEO-робіт та досягнення вимірюваних результатів.
Мій підхід починається з аналізу — ринку, конкурентного середовища, пошукового попиту. На базі цього формую стратегію, яка враховує як технічні, так і контентні та зовнішні фактори. Основні інструменти: Ahrefs, SEranking, Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Screaming Frog, PageSpeed Insights, Looker Studio, а також внутрішні CRM/BI-системи клієнтів.
В рамках технічного SEO проводжу глибокі аудити, пріоритезую задачі, тісно співпрацюю з розробниками. Оптимізую crawl budget, структуру сайту, швидкість, індексацію, мобільну адаптацію. В частині контенту — керую семантичним проєктуванням, оптимізую існуючі сторінки, розробляю контентні стратегії, контролюю SEO-копірайтинг.
Також маю досвід побудови зовнішньої стратегії: визначаю релевантні джерела, розробляю лінкбілдинг-плани з фокусом на якість і авторитетність.
У ролі керівника SEO-відділу координував команду з 2-3 фахівців: розподіляв задачі, проводив code-review SEO-аудитів, займався onboarding нових спеціалістів. Також налагоджував комунікацію між SEO-командою, девелопментом, контентом і менеджментом.
Особливу увагу приділяю аналітиці: регулярно відстежую позиції, поведінкові метрики, зміну трафіку, ефективність змін — і на основі цих даних коригую стратегію.
Поза проєктною роботою ділюсь досвідом через SEO-вебінари, розбір кейсів та огляди трендів.
Наразі відкритий до нових викликів, де можу поєднати стратегічне бачення з hands-on підходом. Мені цікаві проєкти з сильним аналітичним фокусом, продуктовим мисленням і потенціалом зростання."

seo,"Мені 48 років, понад 10 з них я в SEO. За період роботи в SEO індустрії створив та займався пошуковим просуванням близько 40 проєктів таких тематик як онлайн ігри, мікрозайми та банківські кредити ряду країн, низка сайтів цих напрямків виводилися в ТОП, та утримувались там тривалий час по висококонкурентних ключах. Були спроби займатись тематиками криптовалют, азартних ігор, туризму та медицини, але особливого інтересу це не викликало, так як основна зосередженість завжди була на мікрозаймах (що означає великий досвід роботи в YMYL тематиці).
Працював в тій чи іншій інтенсивності практично з усіма ведучими інструментами, які допомагають в роботі SEO-спеціаліста, тому, не повинно виникнути проблем з будь-яким софтом з внутрішньої та зовнішньої оптимізації (переважно використовував в роботі Ahrefs, SE Ranking, Serpstat, Netpeak spider, SemRush, Seo Power Suite, Creasy Frog, Key Collector...).
Розуміюсь на оптимізації таких CMS як Wordpress, DLE та Joomla, знайомий з роботою кількох інших, та ряду популярних конструкторів (тільда, вікс). Є базові навики по знаннях css, html, js, що дозволяє вносити самостійно необхідні нескладні правки коду.
Працював здебільшого самостійно, але з підключенням фрілансерів-програмістів на різних етапах, а також копірайтерів та крауд та аутріч-агенцій на етапі виходу на деякі ринки дальнього зарубіжжя по мікрозаймах.
Також за цей час:
1. Напрацьовано свої підходи в лінкбілдінгу, що приносять результат та економлять бюджети при підборі донорів.
2. Є досвід роботи та хороші результати по роботі з DMCA.
3. Був хороший період на Телдері, де куплялись ряд проєктів, які оцінювались як перспективні, дооптимізовувались з просуванням і подальшим продажем з прибутком. Є хороші навики та досвід з пошуку та придбання потрібних дроп доменів та підклейки їх на різних етапах розвитку основних проєктів.
Знання англійської мови “підзабулось і просіло” за останні роки, у звязку з незатребуваністю, але за 2-3 місяці міг би відновити при потребі до базового рівня А1. Є досвід створення сайтів на англійській, польській, іспанській, чеській, румунській мовах з використанням можливостей алгоритмів штучного інтелекту та Deepl.
У зв'язку з низкою причин скорочую та переформатовую портфель особистих проєктів в роботі, приглядаюсь до нових ніш, ідей та можливостей, в тому числі на ринках дальнього та ближнього зарубіжжя. Радий буду принести користь майбутньому роботодавцю своїми знаннями та навиками, а також сподіваюсь навчитись чогось корисного у вас.
Сподіваюсь на цікаві пропозиції дистанційної роботи в будь-якій тематиці, без офіційного працевлаштування."

seo,"UPDATE:
Please get in touch directly for the latest copy of my CV, since I’ve progressed much from the moment I wrote the following statement.
Please also NOTE that my CV is rather long and very detailed intentionally, aimed to save time for both of us. I do not tolerate questions like - pls tell me about yourself… Yet, specific questions are more than welcome. Thanks.
Background
My name is Yuriy (Sergeyev) Byron. I am of British - Ukrainian origin and thus bilingual. Please allow me to use this very opportunity to introduce myself, mentioning backgrounds relevant to the prospective project.
At the moment, I am working in the position of Head of Content for a multinational hosting provider. I started cooperating with the company as a copywriter (the company's web resources audit). Still, I quickly progressed to overseeing all the existing and produced content, closely tight to cooperation with the digital marketing team.
Before that, I used to work for a large international company deeply engaged in blockchain and cryptocurrency mining, holding a senior managerial position - Head of Administration/Project Coordinator, but in reality, it was much more like hands-on Project Management, combining hardware and software as well as the physical construction of mining facilities.
Please refer to my CV or address direct questions if you are interested in more details of my previous employments and projects I was actively involved in.
Talking of my educational background, roughly - one bachelor's degree and two master's degrees (Unis of Brighton and Kingston, UK) behind my shoulders, as well as professional qualifications in Fin Tech (Uni of Hong Kong) in 2019 and finally, the most recent ones in 2020 - 2021 at the professional certificates obtained from University of California, Stanford and Yale, courses on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, Capital Markets, Negotiations provided by online educational platforms EdX, and Coursera).
The final touch in my self-education was completing an exciting and highly practical Professional Project Management course by Google.
Thereby, I do see myself in the position of successfully performing the expected scope of work and delivering high-quality results.
PMP by Google is probably the most recent and worth pointing one. Plus, my latest publication at DOU - details in my CV, as no links are not allowed here.
Moreover, being good at teaching and coaching, I believe these are perhaps, more complicated than having to manage people or running businesses. Albeit, I have done a number of promising projects in my life to be proud of.
Other than that, my academic and professional highs do also deserve some medals on my chest... giving me wings behind my shoulders  ))) that is to say, I am a regular big fan of online education, using EdeX, and Coursera platforms.
Otherwise, please refer to my full CV for details.
The only thing I can add at this point is that my stress resistance level is almost God))) Kyiv explains it all.
Should you have any further questions, I am more than happy to provide answers.
I definitely don’t want to waste your time as well as mine)
Let’s get things right - I’ve got a well-paid job at the moment but am always open for offers, should those meet my expectations being potentially useful for the offering party. I hope this makes sense. Thanks."

I started my career as a graphic designer and worked at Arena Entertainment company. During my time there, I focused on identity and brand launches for restaurants in Kyiv, including TAO, Beer House, and Wine City Grill. Later, I joined Urban Experts and worked on branding for Lavina Mall. Additionally, I was involved in the transition of the American construction company NAI to the Ukrainian construction market. I also worked on developing the gamification aspect of the Chummy mobile application.
Afterwards, I decided to change my specialization to SEO and accepted a job offer at iDeals, where I worked for one year and eight months in the software/cloud data rooms niche. Subsequently, I moved to Genesis, specifically the CPAmatic project, where I worked for one year in the adult/sugar dating niche. In my most recent experience, I worked for outsourcing companies, providing SEO promotion advice and setting up workflows for monetizing projects. I am well-versed in the entire project development cycle, including launch.
I possess the ability to collaborate with content editors, developers, and designers. I can write comprehensive technical requirements and have experience in ""SCRUM"" development and planning.
One of my most significant experiences was at Boosta, where I worked on a web marketplace project involving database collection. I introduced a work backlog, broke it down into iterative project phases, planned the budget, mentored junior specialists, conducted technical site commissioning, performed site audits, worked on database parsing and clustering logic, made cold calls to obtain expert opinions from our target audience, and developed the monetization system logic in the absence of direct offers in the niche.
Based on my expectations, I aspire to work in a strong team where creativity, the right mindset, and motivation can be easily found. I am looking for a reliable company that plays a significant role in my life, offering social benefits, insurance, and other perks in line with the IT corporate culture."

seo,"Open for part-time or consulting projects.
The main tasks I perform are related to such areas as content marketing and SEO optimization. I have slightly less experience with SMM and e-mail marketing.
I possess a range of skills in using tools to perform assigned tasks in these areas; I quickly master alternative ones since their operating principles are usually similar.
My total work experience is 8 years. In the first three years, I worked as an assistant in similar positions; in the last 5, I have been leading or working solo on similar projects.
Working with a team on a blog covering marketing topics for an English-speaking audience, the materials of which, in less than half a year, are already indexed on the first pages of Google and have become thoroughly entrenched there.
Full organization of the product launch, supervision of its content marketing, overall increase in traffic to the landing page, and increase in conversion.
Successful and long-term establishment of relationships with thematic blogs for link building, successful management of a team of copywriters, and an SMM team to complete the implementation of the content marketing plan.
I constantly monitor developments in the field and engage in self-education to stay in touch with recent industry changes.
I prefer to work in a small team, or independently.
I prefer working with a unique product.
The company should cover the costs of marketing-related tools; having a full set of tools makes it easier to fix a breakdown than with just one screwdriver in your hand, although, of course, you can achieve something with it.
I am more eager to work with young, starting projects, as they are the best place to establish the most effective strategies; unearthing old mammoth projects usually is not an easy task."

seo,"Throughout my career, I've managed and executed comprehensive SEO strategies for a variety of clients, primarily within the iGaming and gambling industries, but also extending to finance, retail, and e-commerce. My projects have ranged from launching new websites from scratch (including strategy, budget, content, and link building) to optimizing existing large-scale websites for improved organic performance. Key tasks have included:
Technical SEO Audits: Identifying and resolving technical issues impacting site performance, including site speed, mobile-friendliness, crawlability, and indexation.
On-Page Optimization: Optimizing content, meta data, URL structures, and internal linking for target keywords.
Off-Page Optimization: Developing and executing link building campaigns, including outreach, content partnerships, and identifying backlink opportunities.
Content Strategy & Creation: Conducting keyword research, performing semantic analysis, creating content briefs, and editing/optimizing content for SEO and user engagement.
Data Analysis & Reporting: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), analyzing website traffic, and generating reports using tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console.
Using AI to automate and improve processes.
I've worked extensively with tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, Majestic, SurferSEO, Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and various CMS platforms (including WordPress). I've also utilized AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to enhance content creation and SEO workflows.
My roles have ranged from individual contributor (Power Affiliate/Webmaster) to team leadership (Senior Off-Page SEO Manager, Head of AI). I've experience collaborating with developers, designers, content writers, and product managers to achieve shared goals. I'm comfortable both leading projects and working as part of a larger team.
I'm currently focused on deepening my expertise in advanced technical SEO, particularly around site architecture and large-scale website migrations. I'm also actively expanding my knowledge of AI-driven SEO techniques and exploring advanced data analysis tools like SQL and BigQuery to further refine my strategic decision-making.
Throughout my career, I've consistently focused on driving measurable results through SEO. I'm most proud of my ability to develop and implement comprehensive SEO strategies that lead to significant improvements in organic traffic, search rankings, and ultimately, business growth for my clients or employers. This involves a combination of technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and a data-driven approach. For example, I've successfully launched new websites from the ground up, optimized existing sites to achieve top rankings in competitive niches, and leveraged AI tools to significantly enhance content quality and SEO performance. I find it incredibly rewarding to see my work directly contribute to tangible business outcomes.
I'm looking for a role where I can contribute my SEO expertise to a company that values data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work with talented individuals across different teams (product, content, development) to achieve shared goals. I'm excited by the opportunity to tackle challenging SEO problems, develop and implement innovative strategies, and see my work directly contribute to the company's growth. I also value opportunities for professional development and learning, as the SEO landscape is constantly evolving.
What I don't want is a role that is overly siloed or where SEO is treated as an afterthought. I believe that SEO should be integrated into all aspects of the digital marketing strategy, and I'm looking for a company that shares this perspective. I also prefer a culture of open communication and transparency, where feedback is valued and constructive criticism is encouraged."

If you are happy to pay a million $$$ per character!
Then congratulations, you are in the right place!
An illiterate copywriter from a young, rapidly growing company with round-the-clock service from polite managers is ready to ruin your project for just a million dollars per hour.

seo,"In the time-span of 3 years, I've been in the business of helping online business owners boost their conversion rate with tailored marketing content.
I've always seen conversion as a game of giving and getting.
What do I mean?
What I mean is - If you want your leads to convert, give them valuable and actionable content.
I say actionable because they need to be able to plug the content or copy(s) you write for them into their website or marketing channel and see measurable results.
Moreover, I'm more of an inbound marketer - My copy(s) are attractive and more than half the time, they don't look like copy(s). They look like fun, informative pieces that seek to give in-depth insight.
So, if your business has an online presence and you need your brand voice to give that genuine human feel, I'm only a message away.
In 3 months, I was able to grow the social media followership of a commerce
and tech solution company by 300% with tailored marketing content. And this went on to generate $70k in revenue for them.
Over time, I intend to stack my portfolio with achievements gotten from the results I bring my clients. I also do not wish to work with clients that aren't ready to communicate all there is to know about their business."

seo,"As a Senior SEO Specialist, I have directed and managed SEO strategies for AIContentfy, contributing to the growth of the company’s ARR from $200K to $1M. I accomplished this through building 80-100 backlinks per month from DA 50+ sites through guest posting and competitive analysis. I grew website traffic from 5k to 256k per month and increased impressions from 292k to 19.4m in 10 months, significantly impacting business expansion.
I leveraged tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Google Analytics to identify backlink opportunities, improve rankings, and increase organic traffic. I’ve obtained more than 1,000 high-quality backlinks for multiple SaaS clients, created and implemented innovative tools for keyword research and SEO tracking, and managed SEO campaigns for 7-8 clients, achieving continuous growth in their rankings.
As part of my responsibilities, I also handled competitive analysis to find backlink sources, and implemented SEO outreach campaigns that increased organic traffic by 400%. Additionally, I increased domain authority from 0 to 50 in five months.
I'm proficient in HubSpot, ClickUp, BacklinkManagerTool, Hunter.io, Ahrefs, and Excel, and have a demonstrated success in driving organic growth through targeted SEO initiatives.
Looking ahead, I’d like to refine my expertise in SEO outreach and content strategies to remain at the forefront of industry developments.
Contributed to significant client successes, including:
SSH: Increased page traffic for a high-competition keyword by 13x in 3 months.
180ops: Elevated Domain Rating from 4 to 40, boosting organic traffic.
Laatukoru: Achieved 4x growth in 5 months for a new eCommerce store.
I’m looking for a chance to expand my expertise in SEO and digital marketing, specializing in targeted outreach efforts, content refinement for better performance, and sustainable and results-driven strategies. I thrive in a team-oriented setting where I can support the team in achieving its objectives while exchanging ideas and gaining insights from colleagues. I also appreciate a role where performance is tracked and evaluated, and I can see the visible and measurable impact of my efforts in driving increased site traffic, enhancing brand presence, and delivering measurable business results.
What I don’t want:
I am not interested in positions that are heavily focused on technical SEO tasks that are not in line with my core strengths. While I have experience in technical SEO, I’m seeking a role that allows me to concentrate on content strategy, link building, and overall SEO campaign management instead of hands-on coding or in-depth technical audits."

seo,"Dear colleague!
My name is Michael, and this is a brief story about me.
I am an SEO strategist and affiliate marketing expert with over 10 years of practical experience. My journey includes working with small business sites and high-load platforms with over a billion indexed pages across various verticals — from e-commerce to iGaming.
Between 2014 and 2018, I built and led an SEO department of 20 specialists in an ambitious startup within the job niche. Over four years, we scaled the organic traffic from zero to over 200,000 daily visits from several geos (Europe, North and South America, Oceania). My responsibilities included hiring, mentoring, developing internal SEO frameworks, setting KPIs, and coordinating efforts with developers, writers, analysts, and product owners.
I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams (developers, content strategists, designers, and product managers) to ensure SEO goals aligned with product roadmaps and business goals. I actively tracked industry trends and algorithm updates and use them to adapt or evolve strategies quickly, especially in highly competitive niches. I also have experience in identifying and solving traffic drops and scaling sites to new geos using subdomains, subfolders, or country-specific domains.
Since 2018, I’ve been entirely focused on the affiliate marketing business in the online gambling niche, covering every part of the SEO lifecycle — from infrastructure and content planning to traffic growth, analytics, and affiliate partnerships.
In affiliate iGaming, I’ve launched and grown multi-geo and multilingual projects (up to 100+) in more than 40 markets, including CA, AU, NZ, UK, DE, AT, ES, IT, PL, CZ, HU, RO and other European markets. I handled the entire stack — from server setup and WordPress development to link-building, technical SEO, and analytics configuration.
What drives me the most is building high-performing systems and strong teams. I highly appreciate knowledge sharing and creating an internal culture where SEO specialists feel freedom of action and see growth.
I’m open to full-time roles or strategic partnerships in the iGaming space. I’m also considering companies that want to invest in their SEO as a core growth channel and are ready to give freedom and responsibility for long-term impact.
I got up to 200k organic traffic daily in the job niche (managing up to 1 billion pages).
Got up to 150k fdt for all time based on RS modeli in iGaming.
I am considering iGaming businesses that want to invest in SEO as a major growth channel and are willing to provide freedom of action and sufficient budgets to implement an SEO strategy."

seo,"Досвід роботи
SEO-фахівець у SEO-studio  (4 роки)
Завдяки старшій подрузі, яка працює в SEO, я зацікавився цією сферою. Спочатку SEO здавалося чимось складним і вузькоспеціалізованим, але її досвід і підхід до справи показали, що це набагато ширше — від аналізу ключових слів до управління видимістю сайту. Вона ділилася знаннями про те, як пошукові системи ранжують сторінки, яку роль відіграють тексти, посилання, аналітика, і чому кожна деталь важлива для успішного просування.
Першим практичним досвідом став аудит сайту, де потрібно було знайти слабкі місця та запропонувати покращення. Цей процес допоміг мені зрозуміти основи внутрішньої та зовнішньої оптимізації, роботи з контентом і аналізу конкурентів.
Основні обов'язки:
Аналіз і дослідження ключових слів
Пошук релевантних ключових слів, які відповідають потребам цільової аудиторії, для підвищення видимості сайту в пошукових системах.
Аудит сайту
Проведення технічного та SEO-аудиту для виявлення слабких місць, таких як швидкість завантаження, помилки індексації, проблеми з мобільною версією та інші технічні аспекти.
Оптимізація контенту
Робота з текстовим наповненням: створення і редагування текстів, мета-тегів (title, description), заголовків (H1, H2 тощо) з урахуванням ключових слів для покращення релевантності контенту.
Лінкбілдінг
Формування стратегії зовнішніх посилань, пошук і залучення якісних зовнішніх посилань для підвищення авторитету сайту в очах пошукових систем.
Моніторинг і аналітика
Постійний моніторинг позицій сайту в пошукових системах, аналіз трафіку, поведінки користувачів, показників конверсії. Використання інструментів аналітики (наприклад, Google Analytics, Google Search Console) для оцінки результатів та коригування стратегії.
Взаємодія з командою розробників
Співпраця з розробниками для впровадження необхідних технічних змін, таких як оптимізація швидкості сайту, коригування файлу robots.txt, налаштування sitemap.xml.
Оновлення знань і адаптація до змін в алгоритмах
Постійний моніторинг змін у алгоритмах пошукових систем та адаптація стратегії SEO під нові вимоги.
Стратегічне планування
Розробка та впровадження довгострокової SEO-стратегії з урахуванням цілей бізнесу, конкурентного аналізу та поточних трендів.
Віддалено в штаті компанії (11 місяців)
Далі працювала над проектом вже напряму з клієнтом. Проект передбачав  роботу з кількома доменами для інтернет-магазину, що займається продажем і доставкою квітів. Здійснювався повний цикл SEO просування, включаючи лінкбілд
Виведення ключових запитів у топ пошукових систем
В одному з проектів я досягла топ-5 позицій за кількома важливими запитами, що значно підвищило органічний трафік на сайт. Для цього я провела глибокий аналіз конкурентів і зробила оптимізацію контенту, налаштувала метатеги та розробила стратегію внутрішніх і зовнішніх посилань.
Збільшення органічного трафіку на 50% за півроку
Після впровадження оновленої SEO-стратегії для одного з сайтів, мені вдалося підняти органічний трафік на 50% протягом шести(?) місяців. Я працювала над поліпшенням релевантності контенту, впроваджувала нові ключові слова і проводила регулярні технічні аудити, щоб оптимізувати швидкість і якість роботи сайту.
Зниження показника відмов на 30%
Завдяки поліпшенню структури сайту, покращенню навігації та адаптації контенту під потреби користувачів, мені вдалося знизити показник відмов на 30%. Це дозволило зробити сайт зручнішим для користувачів і збільшило час їхнього перебування на сторінках, що позитивно вплинуло на конверсії.
Побудова якісного лінкбілдінгу
У процесі роботи над одним із проектів я зосередилась на отриманні якісних зовнішніх посилань із релевантних, авторитетних ресурсів. Це значно підвищило авторитет сайту й допомогло закріпити його позиції в пошукових системах. Моя стратегія полягала в тому, щоб знаходити сайти зі схожою тематикою та домовлятися про співпрацю, що дало стабільні результати.
Розробка комплексної SEO-стратегії з довготривалим ефектом
Я створила і впровадила стратегію для проєкту, яка забезпечила стабільне зростання органічного трафіку навіть через кілька місяців після основної роботи. Для цього я використовувала аналіз ключових слів, створювала корисний контент для блогу, налаштовувала технічні параметри сайту та регулярно аналізувала результати, щоб швидко реагувати на зміни."

seo,"1. Tattoo studio redesign (project)
This project is a website redesign for a tattoo and studio based in Destin, Florida. The design of the existing site looks outdated, not very user-friendly, has low-quality photos and lacks some important information for customers (for example, an indicative price list). Therefore, the goal of the project was to create a modern and user-friendly design that could attract potential customers.
The target audience is young and middle-aged people who are interested in tattoos as a way of self-expression, and also have an aesthetic or symbolic meaning for them.
Before starting the redesign, research and analysis of competitors was carried out. It helped to understand which successful solutions can be used for our project.
2. Web service for lost and found animals.
Web services for lost animals provide owners and search groups with the means to publish information about lost animals and to search for and return lost animals to their owners.
These services allow for the posting of photos and descriptions of animals that have been lost or found, facilitating the reunification of owners through cooperation between the public, owners, and animal welfare organizations.
Such services are important for the quick and efficient resolution of issues related to lost animals and contribute to the safety and well-being of the animals.
I have mastered the design of websites and mobile applications.
I understood the differences and value of responsive web application design.
I learnt how to work with Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Canva.

seo,"I've been in SEO since 2018. My journey started with SEO copywriting. It was a great feeling of satisfaction to see many of the blog posts that I had written appearing on the SERPs. However, after a year of copywriting, I experienced burnout due to the heavy workload and poorly crafted content briefs (not all SEO specialists are proficient in creating them). As a result, in 2019 I decided to learn SEO, so that I could start creating those briefs. However, I had a completely different approach to this, as I understood how copywriters think and what annoys them the most. Anyway, I was so inspired to work in this niche that decided to continue my learning and offer SEO services in full complexity.
What is my approach:
If I'm working with a new client then I always start with deep and detailed SEO research — competitor research, keyword research, client site audit. These three steps are the most important ones as to grow we need to know three things: what's our status, what opportunities we have, and with whom we are fighting in the SERPs. Once the answers are found — I start preparing the SEO strategy.
About my skills:
I have big experience in all main fields of SEO: Technical, On-page, Off-page. However, I don't work with clients who want only Off-page SEO:
1. I simply hate it. I know how to build nice links, and I know how to identify a good and bad link, but I'm not open to being a link builder. I'm able only to control your link builder, so that he won't fool you, do the audits of competitors' backlink profiles.
2. Off-page SEO works best of all in-house. In my opinion, the best links that really drive value to the site are build only in-house, when 100% of your time you spend to one project. I may be wrong, but that's just my opinion.
Guarantees:
1. I don't guarantee, that you will get +100500 sales, +1000% of organic traffic. It is unrealistic to make such calculations since there are many factors of influence and anomalies in the SERPs.
2. I guarantee that I will use only white hat methods and will try to deliver the best I can.
What makes me different:
Unfortunately, there are a lot of lies around this niche. Starting from methods that do not bring anything and ending with promises of golden mountains. I am always honest with my clients and try to do the job with as few resources as possible. I never sell what you don't need.
I have several real cases of successful projects:
1. SEO for Culinary School: 52% of YoY organic growth
2. SEO for a fresh Educational Platform (my own project): from 0 to stable 10K clicks a month in 1 year.
3. SEO for a packaging company: Growth from £69K to £184K in sales in a Year.
4. Content Strategy that lead to 120% of organic growth
More you can find in my LinkedIn Profile
Mostly interested in a managing role / senior level position.  Stable payment of salaries that includes the money transfer fees. An interesting product that is really useful for people. Excellent communication and high-quality organization of processes. Possibility to grow further. Flexible working hours."

seo,"I worked as a tutor at a military unit. This job allowed me to take an ALCPT test and a specialized course for military instructors at the Ivan Chernyakhovsky National Defense University of Ukraine in Kyiv.
After my contract expired, I worked as a private tutor for children. Writing entered my life in 2016 when I was hired as a copywriter for GayWeekends, a tourism-related website. It turned my life upside down and helped me see the light in the darkness.
In 2018, I began working as a freelance translator for the Greek transfer company Aktis.Group and as an SEO content writer for Genesis Tech to create content for Legit.ng (former Naija.ng). Managing multiple jobs may appear difficult, but it was an exciting experience for me because difficulties make us stronger.
From March 2021 till June 2023, I worked as a ghostwriter for a writing services review agency in the USA.
January 2024 - October 2024 - I wrote artciles for a website blog and social media networks for two different companies - one of them specializing in website localization, while the other one - involved in real estate sales in Mauritius.
As of today, I provide English to Ukrainian and russian text translation (and vice versa), as well as blog post content on a variety of topics.
I passed the ALCPT exam at Kyiv National Defernce University of Ukraine named after Ivan Cherniakhovskyi. According to the results, I was accepted into a course on teaching English to military personnel. The course was taught by an ALC trainer from Lackland Air Force Base (Texas). All participants received certificates upon completion.
In 2024, I completed the course ""Digital Marketing of the International Marketing Business Academy""
As a writer, I focus at providing high-quality material that will allow clients to achieve their goals. I want my skills work for good as much as possible while making the effort trully effective.
Every person has to do something useful. So do I.
The ""dont's"":
- I don't write articles about dating, gambling, or cryptocurrency.
- I don't do lead generation, keyword research, competitor analysis, audits, or anything else that isn't part of the copywriter's duties (I only create content based on the given technical task)."

seo,"У меня тот случай, когда хобби превратилось в работу. Начинал с 2012 года обычным копирайтером и дошёл до head of seo в медийной группе.
Есть опыт работы как с коммерческими сайтами, так и СМИ (1-4 млн пользователей в месяц).
С 2022 года работаю в основном под иностранные рынки. Хорошо знаком с продвижением локального бизнеса в GMB.
Хочу работать только in house в продуктовой компании с реальным бизнесом (в идеале применять и local seo), интернет-магазином или СМИ. Агентства с бесконечным потоком отчётов не интересуют, потому что не хочу заниматься ерундой, а seoшкой.
Работа с крупными информационными порталами.
Работа с Discover и Google News.
Оптимизация GMB и локальное продвижение.
Работа с интернет-магазинами медицинской тематики.
Работа по поисковой репутации в сети (SERM).

Точно не хочу работать на галере с безлимитным потоком дешевых клиентов и отчетов, делать так называемое ""Бомж SEO"". Я считаю что если делать работу, то нужно ее делать качественно с первого раза (а это не может быть дешево)."
