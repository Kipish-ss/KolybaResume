backend,"Backend developer with more than 15 years of experience creating microservices across different industries. Experienced in designing APIs, databases, system architecture, and distributed systems.
Some References of real projects:
- Moladin (A used car marketplace). The company grew exponentially from 10+ to 300+ engineers after funding, and I was one of them. The system was monolith, lots of commit conflicts from so many engineers, so I suggested to my team to do in microservices. Our team was the most productive, releasing so many services: Crash Program, Academy Service, Survey Engine, Leaderboard, Agent Tiering, and Loan Origination System. The tech stack was Node.js, Go, Kafka, PostgreSQL, EventStoreDB, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL. The company burned so much cash that they had to do mass layoff in 1 year.
- Achiko (Covid test system). There were 2 teams, a researcher working on the new Covid test product in Switzerland and the Indonesian team built the supporting reservation system to be used in Indonesia. It was a monolith and very slow because existing system used DynamoDB like relational database, so for every query it will scan the whole table to get the record. When I joined, I was tasked to fix this. Apparently the way DynamoDB is used was wrong by the original developer, hence the data structure stored as well. And I was very much involved in Booking module, Test Result module, Vaccination module, authentication module, SMS module, and 3rd party payment (Xendit, Stripe) integration. The company ran out of money in 1 year. Tech stack: node.js (express), DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, SNS/SQS, Redis.
- Getspaze (""space"" renting platform). I built the backend system using Go and MongoDB. This is a terrible tech stack combination to match. A property could have many different fields to store and there's where MongoDB shines. Unfortunately we have to map all of them in Go and it gave me headache all the time. The experience taught me well that it's important to use technology / tools where it shines. In the end, the company failed to get funding and closed down.
- Ayoslide (advertising app on Android). I integrated many third party APIs in order to track ""completion"" and rewards for the users. Tech stack: PHP Lumen, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. It ran out of money in 1 year.
- Gogonesia.com (activity booking system). I was a single developer and build the whole system with PHP Laravel, mysql, html, css, javascript/jquery. It ran out of money in 2 years.

The ideal situation is when I am the only backend developer"
backend,"While working at my last job, I was tasked with radically redesigning an internal web application that no longer met the company's modern requirements. It was necessary to create a new web application from scratch that would provide improved optimization, high performance, and a modern interface and functionality. I was tasked with designing a complete architecture, developing both the frontend - with the implementation of a new interface - and the backend - creating a server and database, and ensuring integration with 1C. This was all done through close cooperation with an interface designer and a 1C programmer.
Main tasks:
- Backend. Developed the server side using Node.js and Express.js in TypeScript, ensuring efficient request processing and integration with the database;
- Frontend. Created the user interface on ReactJS using Material UI for modern design, and also used Redux Toolkit
to manage the state of the application;
- Design. The interface design was developed by a professional designer. I created the application according to the provided design and actively discussed its
details;
- Database. I designed a database based on PostgreSQL.
- Integration. I worked closely with a 1C programmer to organize interaction with the 1C database, which allowed me to receive the necessary requests for the backend;
- Version control and documentation. Used GitHub for version control, tested the application using Jest, and created
documentation using Swagger to support the development process;
Thanks to a holistic approach to architecture design, close cooperation with the designer and effective use of modern technologies, we managed to achieve a significant improvement in the performance and quality of the developed web application.
Before starting this work, I worked commercially as a freelancer for 2 years, and fulfilled various orders to create both front-end and back-end for various, not too complicated purposes. Most of the projects were implemented for university students and friends.

These improvements were achieved through meticulous optimization of backend processes and the implementation of advanced middleware for data validation, which also reduced invalid data entries by **30%**.
I’ve also played a pivotal role in integrating third-party payment gateways into backend systems, ensuring secure and seamless transaction processing. By implementing biometric verification mechanisms, I enhanced account security and prevented unauthorized access, further solidifying the reliability of the systems I worked on. My expertise in API development has allowed me to design and build RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, enabling scalable and efficient backend solutions for real-time applications.
Security has always been a top priority in my work. I’ve integrated JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to backend systems, protecting user data and maintaining system integrity. My contributions to system design and code reviews have ensured that the solutions I deliver are not only scalable but also robust and future-proof.
Collaboration has been a cornerstone of my success. Working with cross-functional teams, I’ve contributed to delivering features **10% ahead of schedule** using Agile methodologies. My ability to seamlessly collaborate with frontend developers, product managers, and other stakeholders has been instrumental in driving project success and achieving business goals.
I’ve also led the development of impactful projects, such as the Wayfarer API, a public bus transportation booking system, and PropertyPro, a real estate platform. These projects required a deep understanding of backend architecture, security, and performance optimization, and I’m proud to have delivered solutions that are both reliable and scalable.
These accomplishments reflect my dedication to delivering high-quality, scalable, and secure backend solutions that drive business growth and enhance user experiences."

backend,"I am a backend developer with 3 years of experience, specializing in the development and optimization of server-side solutions, improving application performance, and working with databases.
At SolidCore Games, I actively contributed to the development of new features and the improvement of existing ones. I contributed 40% to the codebase, redesigned role policies, and implemented an access validation system. Through migrations with Entity Framework Core, I reduced data duplication by 4 times. The integration of Redis for session storage and frequent queries reduced the database load by 2.2 times.
My role also included collaborating with a team of Unreal Engine 5 developers for whom a specific part of the application was being developed. I developed unit tests with 78% coverage, which significantly increased the stability of the application and reduced errors during the integration of new features. Additionally, I improved the interaction between the backend and the web interface, reducing the multi-page structure to a single dynamic page, which enhanced user experience.
Throughout my work, I used Docker Compose for containerization, improving local testing, and managed EC2 instances in AWS, ensuring the stability and scalability of applications in the cloud.

Developed a yaml file for local project deployment using Docker Compose, significantly simplifying the setup process for new developers and eliminating problems with manual container configuration.
Reduced database queries by 220% through a well-planned strategy using Redis, significantly lowering server load and ensuring effective database-cache synchronization.
Quickly adapted to project changes when the backend was expanded to full-stack. Within a week, I learned the necessary frontend basics, studied the project's frontend, and began rewriting outdated pages.
I expect stable and engaging work in a team with opportunities for professional growth.
I seek tasks that allow me to leverage my backend development experience and learn new technologies.

backend,"I design & program highly maintainable systems intended for scale and a long run. Big fan of standards, infrastructure & automation, testing & documentation, fault tolerance, monitoring & reporting.
My developer experience ranges from somewhat regular web development (web stores & social networks) to content management systems to advertisement platforms, then to video conferencing software, and briefly touches (in the distant past, though) CG programming & game development.
Used to be a CTO in startups, gathered & trained teams, worked on project architecture, development & management, but these days I prefer to stick closer to tech & code.
People say I'm kind of good at mentorship — I used to interview & onboard new people, and have given few internal talks on unit testing, SOLID principles & design patterns for the mid & junior staff, and they loved it, and so did I.
I had co-founded a video conferencing startup, which had two clients, one of them being a governmental institution, but it's discontinued years ago. Does this count?
Jokes aside, the only real achievement so far is reviving a dying advertisement startup, which had lame technology & destroyed online reputation. I came there as a middle dev to a team of three developers & two managers and three years later left the flourishing company of 50+ as a CTO.
I'm looking for a competent & motivated team which has top notch development and management culture or is willing to grow and have one. I can help with the development part.

backend,"Experience working as a full stack developer in a startup that is currently frozen.  I am also currently a Python backend developer at OneCloudPlanet, a domestic cloud platform. I have been working for more than half a year
The development path began with writing bots and parsers, telegram bots were created in the form of catalogs, usually of promotional products. The next step was the first online store written using flask, Microsoft SQL Server, Jinja2. After gaining experience, I was able to master Django, with the help of which I was able to implement an online store again, during the development of which something was constantly being redone taking into account new knowledge and skills. A lot of time has passed, I can't remember all the technologies, but you can check out the project on GitHub. As for the technologies used, there were two databases, first SQLite3 was used, then I switched to PostgreSQL, DRF (Django REST Framework), django-betterforms, FormSet, send_mail (eventually I had to switch to terminal messages, as Google introduced new restrictions) The created API using DRF allows you to both edit data, if you have access rights, and view data about the product, collections, etc., but if you do the same with access rights of the staff or administration level, you get JSON with more data, and, as mentioned above, you can edit this data. We also implemented various authorization options (login-password, token). On some pages, including the product cart page, JavaScript (DOM) was used, which allowed you to edit the cart data - increase/decrease the quantity, as well as delete the product. The cart data was stored in cookies. Closer to publishing the project on GitHub, I decided to use Docker and Docker-Compose because I was very interested in these technologies at the time, and it seemed that it was necessary to do so for the greater integrity of the published project. After all the main work, I started optimizing using Django Debug Toolbar and DjangoORM methods, especially the rejection of lazy queries in some places played a significant role in optimization. The project was also covered with Unit tests.
The next project was an API written using technologies such as: FastAPI, RedisOM(ORM), PrintfulAPI, Pydantic, httpx, asyncio, pytest. It was my first experience with NoSQL databases, and my first more or less serious experience with asynchrony.
Recently, I took a course on AWS and React. My goal is to apply the knowledge gained by practicing while creating an online service for marketers. Current technology: mongoDB, FastAri, Motor, Pydantic, boto3, React.
I also had a little experience in developing mobile applications, but I don't have time to develop in this direction yet."
