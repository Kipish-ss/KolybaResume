backend,"Backend developer with more than 15 years of experience creating microservices across different industries. Experienced in designing APIs, databases, system architecture, and distributed systems.
Some References of real projects:
- Moladin (A used car marketplace). The company grew exponentially from 10+ to 300+ engineers after funding, and I was one of them. The system was monolith, lots of commit conflicts from so many engineers, so I suggested to my team to do in microservices. Our team was the most productive, releasing so many services: Crash Program, Academy Service, Survey Engine, Leaderboard, Agent Tiering, and Loan Origination System. The tech stack was Node.js, Go, Kafka, PostgreSQL, EventStoreDB, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL. The company burned so much cash that they had to do mass layoff in 1 year.
- Achiko (Covid test system). There were 2 teams, a researcher working on the new Covid test product in Switzerland and the Indonesian team built the supporting reservation system to be used in Indonesia. It was a monolith and very slow because existing system used DynamoDB like relational database, so for every query it will scan the whole table to get the record. When I joined, I was tasked to fix this. Apparently the way DynamoDB is used was wrong by the original developer, hence the data structure stored as well. And I was very much involved in Booking module, Test Result module, Vaccination module, authentication module, SMS module, and 3rd party payment (Xendit, Stripe) integration. The company ran out of money in 1 year. Tech stack: node.js (express), DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, SNS/SQS, Redis.
- Getspaze (""space"" renting platform). I built the backend system using Go and MongoDB. This is a terrible tech stack combination to match. A property could have many different fields to store and there's where MongoDB shines. Unfortunately we have to map all of them in Go and it gave me headache all the time. The experience taught me well that it's important to use technology / tools where it shines. In the end, the company failed to get funding and closed down.
- Ayoslide (advertising app on Android). I integrated many third party APIs in order to track ""completion"" and rewards for the users. Tech stack: PHP Lumen, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. It ran out of money in 1 year.
- Gogonesia.com (activity booking system). I was a single developer and build the whole system with PHP Laravel, mysql, html, css, javascript/jquery. It ran out of money in 2 years.

backend,"Працюючи на останньому місці роботи, я отримав завдання кардинально переробити внутрішній веб‑додаток, який вже не відповідав сучасним вимогам компанії. Необхідно було створити новий веб‑додаток з нуля, який забезпечував би покращену оптимізацію, високу продуктивність та сучасний інтерфейс і функціонал. Переді мною постало завдання спроектувати повну архітектуру, розробити як фронтенд – з реалізацією нового інтерфейсу, так і бекенд – створити сервер та базу даних, і забезпечити інтеграцію з 1С. Це все здійснювалося завдяки тісній співпраці з дизайнером інтерфейсів та 1С‑програмістом.
Основні задачі:
- Бекенд. Розробляв серверну частину з використанням Node.js та Express.js на TypeScript, забезпечуючи ефективну обробку запитів і інтеграцію з базою даних;
- Фронтенд. Створював інтерфейс користувача на ReactJS з використанням Material UI для сучасного оформлення, а також використовував Redux Toolkit
для управління станом додатку;
- Дизайн. Дизайн інтерфейсу було розроблено професійним дизайнером. Я створював додаток згідно з наданим дизайном і активно обговорював його
деталі;
- База даних. Проектував базу даних на основі PostgreSQL.
- Інтеграція. Тісно співпрацював із 1С‑програмістом для організації взаємодії з базою даних 1С, що дозволяло отримувати необхідні запити для бекенду;
- Контроль версій та документація. Використовував GitHub для контролю версій, проводив тестування додатку з використанням Jest та створював
документацію з допомогою Swagger для підтримки процесу розробки;
Завдяки цілісному підходу до проектування архітектури, тісній співпраці з дизайнером і ефективному використанню сучасних технологій, вдалося досягти значного покращення продуктивності та якості розроблюваного веб‑додатку.
До початку цієї роботи 2 роки працював комерційно на фрілансі, та виконував різноманітні замовлення зі створення як фронтенду, так і бекенду для різних, не надто складних цілей. В основному проекти реалізовувались для студентів вузів та знайомих.
Очікування
Шукаю компанію з цікавими проектами, де зможу застосувати свої знання для вирішення складних задач та професійного росту. Хочу працювати дистанційно. Я готовий запропонувати свою повну віддачу і стати приємним і дружнім доповненням до вашої команди.
Чого не хочу
Не хочу працювати в середовищі з надмірною бюрократією, де процеси заважають швидкому та ефективному виконанню задач. Також не зацікавлений у проектах, які не передбачають можливості професійного розвитку та застосування сучасних технологій."

backend,"I am a backend developer with 3 years of experience, specializing in the development and optimization of server-side solutions, improving application performance, and working with databases.
At SolidCore Games, I actively contributed to the development of new features and the improvement of existing ones. I contributed 40% to the codebase, redesigned role policies, and implemented an access validation system. Through migrations with Entity Framework Core, I reduced data duplication by 4 times. The integration of Redis for session storage and frequent queries reduced the database load by 2.2 times.
My role also included collaborating with a team of Unreal Engine 5 developers for whom a specific part of the application was being developed. I developed unit tests with 78% coverage, which significantly increased the stability of the application and reduced errors during the integration of new features.

backend,"Hello!
I’m Abreham, a dedicated Back-End Engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in backend development, DevOps, and full-stack systems. I specialize in building secure, scalable, and high-performance applications—from real-time gaming platforms to job board systems that connect thousands of users.
My toolkit includes technologies like NestJS, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I’ve integrated payment gateways such as Stripe and Chapa to power smooth transaction flows. I’m also skilled in setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins and Docker to automate deployments and improve delivery speed.
One of my key projects was a virtual games platform designed to handle over 10,000 concurrent users, where I led backend development, real-time interactions, and payment processing. I also developed a job board application with secure JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and scalable infrastructure—boosting employer engagement and simplifying job applications.
What sets me apart is not just the code I write, but the systems I help scale, the teams I collaborate with, and the performance I strive to improve. I love working on impactful products, solving real-world problems, and staying on the edge of backend and DevOps best practices.
I'm currently open to exciting opportunities where I can bring my experience, enthusiasm, and growth mindset to help build something great.

backend,"I design & program highly maintainable systems intended for scale and a long run. Big fan of standards, infrastructure & automation, testing & documentation, fault tolerance, monitoring & reporting.
My developer experience ranges from somewhat regular web development (web stores & social networks) to content management systems to advertisement platforms, then to video conferencing software, and briefly touches (in the distant past, though) CG programming & game development.
Used to be a CTO in startups, gathered & trained teams, worked on project architecture, development & management, but these days I prefer to stick closer to tech & code.
People say I'm kind of good at mentorship — I used to interview & onboard new people, and have given few internal talks on unit testing, SOLID principles & design patterns for the mid & junior staff, and they loved it, and so did I.
I had co-founded a video conferencing startup, which had two clients, one of them being a governmental institution, but it's discontinued years ago. Does this count?
Jokes aside, the only real achievement so far is reviving a dying advertisement startup, which had lame technology & destroyed online reputation. I came there as a middle dev to a team of three developers & two managers and three years later left the flourishing company of 50+ as a CTO.
I'm looking for a competent & motivated team which has top notch development and management culture or is willing to grow and have one. I can help with the development part.
The actual industry, technological stacks & architectural approaches don't matter much to me, but if I was to choose I'd like to stick closer to strictly typed & compiled languages, and distributed/microservice architectures.

Шлях в розробці почався з написання ботів та парсерів, телеграм боти були створений у вигляді каталогів, зазвичай акційного товару. Наступною сходинкою став перший інтернет магазин написаний з використанням flask, Microsoft SQL Server, Jinja2. Після отриманого досвіду зміг опанувати Django за допомогою якого знов реалізувати інтернет магазин, під час розробки якого весь час щось перероблювалось з урахуванням нових знань та навичок. Багато часу пройшло, я можу не всі технології пригадати, але ви можете ознайомитися з проектом на GitHub. Що стосовно використаних технологій, це були дві бази данних, спочатку використовувалась SQLite3 потім перейшов до PostgreSQL, DRF(Django REST Framework), django-betterforms, FormSet, send_mail(з часом довелося перейти на повідомлення у термінал, так як Google ввів нові обмеження) Створене API з використанням DRF дозволяє як редагувати данні, при наявності прав доступу, так і переглядати дані про товар, колекції і тп, але якщо ви робите те саме з правами доступу рівня персоналу, або адміністрації, то отримуєте JSON з більшою кількістю данних, ну а також, як сказано вище - ви можете редагувати ці дані. Також були реалізовані різні варіанти авторизації(логін-пароль, токен). На деяких сторінках, в тому числі й на сторінці корзини товару був задіяний JavaScript(DOM), що дало змогу редагувати дані кошику - збільшувати/зменшувати кількість, а також видаляти товар. Данні кошику зберігались у cookies. Ближче до розміщенню проекта на GitHub я вирішив використати Docker та Docker-Compose так як ці технології дуже мене зацікавили в той час, та й здавалось, що це необхідно зробити для більшої цілостності опублікованого проекту. Після всіх основних робіт я взявся за оптимізацію з використанням Django Debug Toolbar та методів DjangoORM, особливо відмова від лінивих запитів місцями відіграла значну роль у оптимізації. Також проект був покритий Unit тестами.
Наступним проектом був API написаний з використанням таких технологій, як: FastAPI, RedisOM(ORM), PrintfulAPI, Pydantic, httpx, asyncio, pytest. Це був перший досвід з використанням NoSQL базами данних, та перший більш-менш серйозний досвід з асинхроностью.
Нещодавно ознайомився з курсом по AWS, та React. Маю на меті засвоїти отримані знання практикуючись при створенні онлайн-сервісу для маркетологів. Технологія наразі: mongoDB, FastApi, Motor, Pydantic, boto3, React.
Також мав невеликий досвід у розробці мобільних додатків, але поки не має часу розвиватись у цьому напрямку."

backend,"I began my journey in the world of software engineering working as a Full Stack Web Developer. This role introduced me to the exciting and dynamic field of web development. During this period, I was fortunate to work on a wide range of web projects, which allowed me to gain valuable experience in various technologies such as NestJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, Angular, and VueJS. These experiences not only deepened my technical knowledge but also improved my problem-solving skills.
As my career progressed, I had the opportunity to work on two distinct projects that pushed the boundaries of my expertise. In the first project, I was tasked with maintaining and improving back end services for a power bank sharing system. It was my first experience with managing an existing system, and I enjoyed the challenge of fixing bugs and optimizing performance in a real-world, production environment. In the second project, I was part of a team that developed a healthcare companion app designed for individuals suffering from psoriasis in Munich, Germany. This experience was particularly fulfilling as we successfully launched the first release in a relatively short timeframe. The complexity of this project deepened my understanding of software development and the Agile methodology.
After my tenure in the software industry, I transitioned to academia as a University Assistant, where I had the privilege of teaching Object Oriented Programming. This role allowed me to share my knowledge and fine-tune my communication skills. I found it particularly rewarding to help students grasp challenging concepts and make complex topics more accessible.
My educational journey was a crucial part of my professional development, culminating in the achievement of a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. This academic program provided me with a strong foundation in software engineering, reinforcing the skills and knowledge I had gained throughout my career."
backend,"All one and a half years of my experience, I worked in one company and on one project. As I progressed professionally, the tasks became more complex.
At first, there was a refactoring of the backend business logic to isolate architecture layers. After that period, I fixed backend bugs, implemented simple endpoints, and created basic pages using Vue 2. Additionally, a significant amount of work involved documentation, such as covering the entire backend with jsDoc and describing endpoints in Swagger.
Later on, I entered a phase of optimizing and increasing the RPS (Requests Per Second) of our API. During this time, I focused on optimizing queries in Mongo, writing migrations, changing collection structures, configuring cron tasks, etc. I also worked on caching responses from the database, moving some data entirely to Redis, and migrating certain functionalities to node.js events when possible.
After that, I started handling more global tasks, such as setting up AWS services like S3, CloudFormation, CloudFront, Lambda, extending the authentication module, and developing APIs for a related project.
My responsibilities also included indirect communication with other teams of the client and mentoring new team members. Currently, I assess my role in the project as a Middle backend developer.
In a nutshell, my work involved project support. In the future, I would like to further develop my skills in backend development.

backend,"Over six years, I’ve built a career at the intersection of backend development and cloud engineering, where solving complex problems is as rewarding as shipping reliable systems. I’ve navigated everything from resource-constrained environments to globally distributed platforms, always prioritizing performance, scalability, and maintainability.
I’ve wielded frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI to architect APIs that power mission-critical applications—whether it’s streamlining e-commerce workflows or enabling offline-first functionality for users in spotty connectivity zones. My JavaScript toolkit (Node.js, ReactJS) has driven full-stack projects that marry intuitive UIs with rock-solid backends, while Go has become my go-to for high-concurrency services where speed and efficiency matter most.
On the cloud front, I’ve turned AWS into an extension of my engineering practice. From sculpting serverless architectures with Lambda to optimizing S3 storage costs and fine-tuning RDS performance, I’ve designed systems that scale seamlessly. Containerization? Docker and Kubernetes are second nature—I’ve orchestrated clusters that handle traffic spikes without breaking a sweat. And when it comes to automation, Terraform and Ansible have been my partners in crime for infrastructure-as-code and repeatable deployments.
Collaboration is baked into how I work. I’ve led engineering teams through greenfield projects, mentored junior developers on clean code practices, and championed DevOps workflows that slashed deployment cycles by 40%. One standout moment? Redesigning a legacy monolith into a modular microservices architecture that cut latency by 60% while future-proofing the codebase.
I thrive in the trenches—whether debugging a payment gateway integration at 2 AM or prototyping a translation API to reach underserved markets. My north star? Building systems that not only survive real-world chaos but excel in it.
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me tinkering with open-source contributions, organizing events, reverse-engineering SRE playbooks, or geeking out over the latest in distributed systems. Let’s build something that matters."
backend,"In my previous positions, I primarily worked as a Backend Developer. My main responsibilities included supporting and implementing projects for small and medium-sized businesses, except for the period when I worked as a system administrator at the Vashkivtsi City Council.
At AlterEgo, I held the position of Trainee/Junior Backend Developer, mainly working on tasks of medium complexity. All projects were based on the Laravel Framework. I also participated in working with databases for several projects.
At SapientPro, I worked on multiple projects simultaneously, and towards the end of my career in this position, I additionally engaged in the development of WordPress projects. I can discuss the projects I worked on during the interview. On these projects, I used Yii2, Laravel, WordPress, basic programming tools and technologies (Git, Scrum, Trello, REST, etc.), and I also had the opportunity to work on mobile development, particularly with React Native and Flutter.
During my time working at these companies, I achieved the level of Middle Backend Developer.
In my most recent position, I gained significant experience, ranging from system design to database optimization, writing custom queues, and developing mobile applications.
I am seeking stable, long-term cooperation on a remote basis. Unfortunately, due to the war and some additional, well-known reasons, I had to relocate. Currently, I am living in Iceland. However, I do not have enough experience and English proficiency to start a career here. Therefore, I plan to find a calm remote position to realize my career goals and dreams.
Technically, I want to be involved in a long-term project to which I can adapt and continue to grow. I learn very quickly, so over time, I can take on projects with completely different technologies or programming languages.
I categorically do not want to work on stressful projects. The best results from me can be achieved when I am proactive, which requires a stress-free environment.
I am also actively studying English, and my goal is to reach the B2 level."

backend,"I'm a passionate backend developer with hands-on experience building secure, scalable systems in fintech and blockchain. Over the past year, I've been working at Nimbus where I design and optimize financial platforms - from developing cryptocurrency wallet systems to implementing real-time transaction processing.
My journey started with building mobile apps at Beecode Solutions, where I fell in love with solving complex backend challenges. This led me to specialize in Python (Django) and API development, skills I now use daily to create robust financial infrastructure. I particularly enjoy bridging the gap between technical systems and user needs - whether that's through seamless API integrations or intuitive security features.
What excites me most is working on products that make a real impact. My proudest achievement is developing the backend for Nimbus's wallet system, ensuring people's digital assets remain secure while maintaining top performance. I also built Breatheasy, an air quality monitoring app that combines my full-stack skills with my interest in environmental tech.
When I'm not coding, I'm usually exploring new technologies (currently diving deeper into microservices architecture) or mentoring junior developers. I believe great software comes from both technical excellence and collaborative problem-solving.
Technologies I work with regularly:
Backend: Python (Django, DRF), Node.js
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
DevOps: Docker, Redis, Celery
Web: JavaScript, Next.js
Mobile: FlutterFlow
Backend Development & Scalability, System Integration & Security and Cross-Platform Development.
At Nimbus, I designed and scaled backend architecture using Django REST Framework, successfully migrating our database from SQLite to PostgreSQL to enhance performance and complex data handling. This transition improved our system's ability to manage financial transactions more efficiently. I built a secure wallet system with backup/recovery solutions, ensuring proper fund management, and developed optimized RESTful APIs for financial operations including deposits, withdrawals, and user interactions.

I developed a complex Telegram bot called ""police-sos-bot,"" which replicates all the functions of the Android app by using the Telegram API documentation. This bot performs multiple functions.
In the Wiki Quiki Delivery Service project, I implemented a feature to suggest the most affordable and suitable transportation option based on cargo weight and distance. Options include a bicycle for up to 10 kg/10 km, a motorcycle for 25 kg/30 km, a car for 100 kg/80 km, and a truck for heavier loads. I then calculated distances to recommend the cheapest and most convenient transport method.
I wrote a complex query in the Test App project to generate mixed questions very quickly without repeating the questions for the users.
The restaurant CRM project had a problem with the profit calculation, so I added a table from ""purchase"" to the project, and the profit calculation was fixed.
I have participated in more than 15 projects using similar technologies

Backend developer | Peak Strength
A Fitness application that helps people find the perfect workout program based on their experience in sports, age, weight and other criteria. When a user is onboarded, they answer a series of questions: experience level, age, height, weight, optionally sport & position, and list of exercise equipment available to them. These answers are used to select one of the “master” programs as a template to create a custom user program specific to the user. The user is also asked for a start and end date for the program they would like to create.
Result: As a result, I've developed new, supported features, written tests for them, and optimized and reorganized the old code base. Since the code was initially written using JavaScript, I rewrote all main functionalities using TypeScript.

My name is Oleksii, and I am a Python Developer with experience in Django, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy. I am passionate about building scalable backend solutions and have experience working with relational databases (especially PostgreSQL and SQLite) and containerization technology Docker. I believe that for a developer, it's not only about knowing technologies but also working well in a team, so I focus a lot on collaboration with colleagues and use Agile practices for efficient project management.
In my work, it's not just the technical skills that matter but also my approach to problem-solving. For example, during my work on an online library project, I implemented a Telegram bot that gives users access to the library and automates the book reservation and payment processes. I also worked on integrating payment systems into this project, which significantly improved the user experience.
My technical education in cybersecurity and computer systems and networks gave me a solid foundation for understanding deeper aspects of programming and data security. This allows me to develop not only functional but also secure solutions.
What sets me apart as a candidate is my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies and my constant desire for self-improvement. I enjoy working on challenging tasks and always look for opportunities to improve every aspect of my work, from the code to team communication.
Through working on different projects, I have developed not only my technical skills but also my soft skills: time management, team management, and decision-making in stressful situations.

Following this, I joined Yandex as part of the Cryptography team, contributing to the development of Lockbox, a secure product for managing sensitive data. My role included designing and deploying client APIs, as well as leading critical product deployments.
At Amazon, I further expanded my technical expertise, working with AWS, ReactJS, Java, and TypeScript. During my tenure, I created a service that sent data to analytics teams using Amazon Athena and gained hands-on experience with databases like MongoDB and MySQL. While my time at Amazon was brief due to a company-wide layoff, it was highly impactful in enhancing my skills in large-scale distributed systems.
Currently, I am part of Umag, a growing company in Kazakhstan, where we provide digital solutions for supermarkets. I am actively involved in scaling our product by transitioning from monolithic architecture to a duality-based system, optimizing performance, and mentoring junior engineers. I also lead the creation of migration plans and ensure we meet quarterly goals.
With a solid foundation in Java, Kotlin, and C++, as well as expertise in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, I am now seeking a remote software engineering position. I am particularly interested in roles where I can contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with talented teams, and continue growing professionally in a remote-first environment.v"

backend,"My career in web development started approximately at 2010, and for 5 year i was working with different CMS, than switched to development based on frameworks, Zend 1, Zend 2, Symphony, Yii2, Laravel and some microframeworks that i don`t remember already, 7 years ago i started usign NodeJS for services that require realtime communications and now most of my projects are based on NodeJS. Also had small projects on Java(cryptographic solution) and GO. I was working on healthcare, marketing, ecommerce, gambling and internal management systems, have 4 year expirience in dev team management. Now i mostly switched back to development and relatively small projects, but still take part in supporting some customer`s internal solutions.
* On one of projects we had to deploy solution to bare-metal kubernetes, we didn`t have any system administrators, and i build operational, fault-tolerant cluster. It was not big, 3 master nodes and 8 worker nodes, but worked well for all period of customer`s tasks to be done, and after 2 years was stopped in working state.
* Had build self-scaling stateful solution for processing inpredictable amounts of incoming data.
* While working on gambling website built scalable system, that allowed simultanious connections from thousands of players and viewers without impact on gaming cycle and timings
* Most of projects for last 5 years have been fault-tolerant, were able and survived losses of parts of system
* On several projects done research for most cost-effective and high-quality thidr-party solutions required for data storage, paymants and other external systems
* Optimized information storage for 8+TB ElasticSearch data, reduced import time by 70%, and search speed to 150-200ms from seconds and minutes in some scenarios.
* On gambling website we had integration that took 16+CPU cores and still failed, also this solution had huge problems with external service because it caused something like DDoS on ther infrastructure, after month of work we optimized it to use 4CPU cores (total of 75% reduce) and in communication with service tram we managed to make some improvements that allowed us to send 3x time less requests for data synchronisation, which also affected not only our service performace, but their systems too
* When on of projects we required compact solution for task ""take emails for domain, get code from it and put it into database"" i took go and in 3 days deployed email receiver, which trapped al incoming emails, checked them and did all the job. I haven`t used external software, just go packages for mail server and mysql, so solution was near 4MB (could be better, but without experience i had not enough time), was ""scratch"" docker image and in peak processed hundreds of emails per second
I`m interested in product teams, not in outstaff and similliar. Also i prefer NodeJS over PHP, maybe can look also at another languages."

My recent work was about taking a large underspecified feature  in a large e-commerce  product and taking it to completion through the full cycle from design to development to refactoring monitoring  and support as the user base and load of the feature grew.
My work included communication, design of database schemas (PostgreSQL), exchange protocols through HTTP and Kafka queues.
Architectural design, designing Jira tasks with collaboration with the team  and writing code for backend (Clojure functional programming language),  and some business facing frontend (React.js, Ant JavaScript framework).
As well as creating simple analytics (Grafana), using flame graph debugging to find and optimise bottlenecks,  using Sentry for monitoring and fixing bugs.
Collaboration with ops team to optimise load. We’ve  been using modern best practices (deploy in docker on Kubernetes on AWS, using github actions) but it is was not my primary focus.
I am proud of seeing through complex sometimes underspecified tasks from inception to completion.  Optimising code through growth phase and solving complex bugs sometimes across systems.

I see myself building platforms / infrastructure (as a Service) software in the future. Experience handwriting and performance tuning SQL (PostGres) queries.
Strangling monoliths:
At a prior company, was part of the team that strangled functionality out of a very core monolith, decoupling it into more independently manageable micro services that could be deployed independently leading to increased iteration speed during development.
Performance improvements:
Identified GC issues (in NodeJS) across a web crawler with lead to very long pauses in the process. Fixed the issue by introducing batching and prevented the very noticeable pause and cut down execution time from 10 hours to an hour thirty minutes.
Designing Systems for Scaling:
Designing event driven systems for scale, decoupling processing / consuming / worker logic from the rest of the system leading to better scaling opportunities.
CI/CD pipelines:
In smaller teams I have worked on, I have had the responsibility of setting up CI/CD pipelines looking to optimize speed, introduce caching layers where possible. I've used varied tools from gitlab / github yaml files and workflows to Iaac using serverless framework, AWS CDK and managing terraform projects."

I specialize in corporate systems implemented in PHP (Laravel, Symfony, Yii). These projects are also called: enterprise systems, corporate systems, ERP systems, CRM systems. They are characterized by complex business logic, large volumes of data, and have many forms, reports, etc. The standard implementation is the backend API core, and different technologies at the frontend. Additionally, these projects often include numerous API integrations with various third-party services (both as clients and providers of data or services).
The complexity of these projects and their continuous development require the use of planning and development technologies such as DDD (Domain-Driven Design), OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), Design Patterns, SOLID principles, Continuous Delivery, etc.
In these projects, I performed all the work, taking responsibility for all stages of product development and implementation. If necessary, I can perform the tasks of an architect and/or lead backend developer. In many cases, these projects are continuations of old ones, requiring migration and transition. I have experience in these situations, from developing transition strategies to implementing them. I also have experience automating development tasks.

backend,"Greetings
I am an experienced Node.JS backend developer with 5 years of commercial experience. Also can work with C# and Python in backend (can learn and switch to Go in 1-2 week if required).
I have worked with different databases, I am an expert in both SQL and NoSQL, and worked with both OLTP and OLAP databases.
I am an expert in SQL functions ( recursive as well ), triggers and procedures, have experience working with channels for ELT strategies.
In one of my projects, I synced PostgreSQL with Redis and ElasticSearch by opening a channel in PostgreSQL and pushing notifications to it while Node.JS was listening to them and updating ElasticSearch and Redis in realtime ( there was a debouncer to prevent some unexpected multiple updates ). Redis was used to handle permissions and only the server was accessing it and ElasticSearch was used for searching our catalogue.
Worked with all notification services including Firebase.
I have used Socket.io to make a chat for one of my e-commerce projects to handle a conversation between the user and admin.
I have experience with AWS S3, SES, RDS, Glue, and Redshift. For most of the backend projects I used Nest.js, however, I can also use Express, Fastify and .NET.
I have worked with Stripe for payments, and subscriptions, and generated custom invoices.

backend,"Python Back-end разработчик
Опытный Python Back-end разработчик с более чем 3 годами коммерческого опыта, включая 10 месяцев работы в финтех-организации. Мой путь начался с фриланса, где я занимался самыми разнообразными проектами - от мелких задач, автоматизации и чат-ботов до масштабных приложений. В настоящее время я занимаю позицию Back-end Разработчика в команде скоринга финтех компании. В свободное время уделяю себя разработке и развитию собственных pet-проектов.
С самого начала моего пути разработки я использовал комбинацию Flask и SQLAlchemy для своих проектов. На этом этапе своей карьеры я создавал приложения, основанные на этом стеке. Однако с течением времени меня заинтересовало асинхронное программирование, и я решил исследовать новые возможности. Это привело меня к использованию современного инструмента - FastAPI, в паре с MongoDB, что открывает двери к эффективной асинхронной работе. Я продолжаю использовать этот стек для своих личных проектов и в основной рабочей деятельности. Кроме того, у меня есть небольшой опыт работы с Django/DRF (4 месяца в стартапе).
Имею опыт настройки CI/CD и работы с облачными технологиями (Преимущественно работал с Google Cloud). Также, я обладаю глубоким пониманием особенностей работы с протоколом MTProto Telegram и всем, что с этим связано.
В моей карьере как разработчика я всегда стремллюсь к улучшению. Я не останавливаюсь на достигнутом, и стараюсь постоянно развиваться как инженер, и сразу же применяю новые навыки в реальных проектах. В этом контексте особо горжусь своими pet-проектами – они не только дают мне возможность применять полученные навыки на практике, но и также дали мне небольшой пассивный доход.
Фриланс показал мне важность коммуникации и что для разработчика важны далеко не только tech-скиллы. Взаимодействие с клиентами, согласование деталей – это дало мне понимание, что работа – не просто код, а решение реальных задач.
Сейчас я вливаю свою энергию в текущий проект. Был период, когда я переписывал большую часть системы, чтобы использовать новые технологии, такие как Apache Airflow. Я стал ключевым разработчиком в этом процессе.
Когда я погружаюсь в проект, не важно, свой или в рамках работы, я всегда ищу возможности сделать все еще лучше. Для меня важно не только выполнить задачу, но и добиться видимых результатов и улучшений в процессе работы.
Я искренне верю, что успешная сотрудничающая команда строится на взаимном уважении и ценности вклада каждого члена. Очень важно для меня, чтобы моя работа оценивалась и мне предоставлялось пространство, как инженеру, для творчества и реализации. Я стремлюсь не только выполнять поставленные задачи, но и активно вносить свои идеи и подходы, которые могут способствовать улучшению проекта.
Взаимодействие в команде, где ценят мою преданность и ответственный подход, позволяет мне погрузиться в проекты и гарантировать высокую результативность. Я готов внимательно вникать в детали каждого проекта, над которым работаю, и внести максимальное усилие в достижение общих целей."

backend,"While I was learning Java core and Java Web, I worked on several real-world projects that allowed me to apply my skills and gain practical experience. One of the most significant projects was a student tracker app, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the backend system using Spring Boot. I used technologies like Java, Spring Framework, Hibernate, and MySQL to build a robust and scalable application. My role involved collaborating closely with frontend developers and ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend.
In another project, I developed a simple e-commerce website where I handled both frontend and backend tasks. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Java with Spring Boot for the backend. This project gave me hands-on experience with RESTful APIs, data persistence, and user authentication.
I excelled in backend development and database management but would like to improve my frontend skills, particularly in modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. In my next role, I aim to further enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain more experience in full-stack development.
During my learning journey, I successfully completed several projects that showcased my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. For instance, in the student tracker app, I implemented a complex user authentication system that significantly enhanced the security of the application. This involved using Spring Security and JWT tokens, which was a challenging but rewarding experience.
I also improved the performance of the e-commerce website by optimizing database queries and implementing efficient data caching techniques. This resulted in faster load times and a better user experience, which was recognized by my instructors and peers.
Through these projects, I acquired valuable skills in Java, Spring Boot, and database management, as well as a deeper understanding of web application development. These accomplishments have prepared me for a junior position or internship, where I can continue to learn and contribute to impactful projects.
