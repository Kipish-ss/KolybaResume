Crop percentage estimation of Telangana
state by GIS
91 Days
Crop percentage estimation of Telangana
using GIS (Geographic Information System)
involves analyzing satellite imagery and spatial
data to assess the area covered by various
crops. This process includes data collection,
image processing, and classification
techniques to map and quantify agricultural
land use. GIS allows for precise monitoring of
crop patterns, helping to estimate the
percentage of different crops across the state.
This information is vital for agricultural
planning, resource management, and
ensuring food security in Telangana.
