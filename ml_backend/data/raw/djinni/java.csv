It represents encryption and decryption of the text by the key (the number by which each letter will be shifted in the alphabet), the path to the file, the key, and the keyword (encrypt, decrypt) go to the input, we get a new file at the same path in which the text is encrypted/decrypted
2)Animal island - the project was done at a stage when I studied java for about 3-4 months. The project is a programmed island model with variable parameters
All data, from the size of the island and ending with the properties of animals are stored in the property in resources
Also added primitive logging(log4j2), which logs changes in the life of animals in the file and console and lombok
The project may still be in a long development, because the possible development is almost limitless (addition of different plant species, reproduction of animals depending on the article, change in animal behavior, weather conditions, GUI, etc.)
3)Test of Java Knowledge - this project is a site where you can test yourself in knowledge of java core, when writing which were used: Java, Maven, Apache Tomcat, Log4j2, JUnit, HTML/CSS, JSP, Jakarta servlets.
Also I have many mini-projects and keep working on new projects

////////////////////////////////////////////////
Collaborating closely with my team, we have propelled the optimization of over ten big microservices, leveraging technologies like Spring Boot, JDBC, and SQL to drive dynamic and efficiency project growth.
////////////////////////////////////////////////
- Reduced memory consumption within the database by 4% by identifying patterns and creating rules for storing specific utility fields.
- Rewrote over 80% of the logic in the high-load administrative microservice to achieve improved performance. This was accomplished by rethinking the data processing logic, resulting in significant performance enhancements. The optimization efforts allowed for the launch pods to be allocated up to 60% of the initial memory capacity.
- Improved the performance of the information retrieval algorithm by reducing the number of database queries from microservices from N*3 to 4 queries, resulting in information processing time decreasing from 40-70 seconds up to <2 seconds."

Doing diffirent kinds of projects taught me the importance and responsibility of each individual role in the project. Basically, I have always been responsible for the design and implementation stages of the backend part of applications.
I recently finished my bachelor's thesis in which I created the listenGo app. While creating this application, I honed my skills in writing backend parts of applications using Java and Java-based frameworks. In addition, I learned the basics of Frontend and created an interface for the listenGo application using JavaScript and React.js. You can explore my Git to learn more about the implementation of each part of the program.
One of my recent accomplishments is completing a self-study Java program from Epam Systems. In this program, I dived deeper into the capabilities of the Spring Framework and honed my skills with VCS such as Git. At the end of the program, I learned and repeated everything I needed to develop the backend of applications.
I expect that we will have a close-knit community at work that will help each other in personal growth every day. Of course, I want an experienced mentor to help me overcome obstacles on the start of my career path.

java,"With over 10 years of professional experience, I have a strong background in software development and have successfully taken on various roles within teams. My expertise includes project management, software architecture, and team leadership. I have contributed to the development of IoT-related, mission-critical, and scientific software systems.
As a dedicated team player, I value personal contributions as much as overall team and project success. I am always ready to support my teammates and foster collaboration to achieve shared goals.
As a Development Lead, I successfully guided our product from the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage to full production, achieving the capacity to handle up to 100 million messages per day. I led efforts to enhance the system's scalability and resilience through a partial redesign of the existing microservices-based architecture. This involved strategic decomposition, enabling horizontal duplication of critical services, and replacing the storage solution with a more suitable type (NoSQL, Graph database) to meet evolving requirements.
I am seeking a role in a team with strong technical expertise, where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow my professional skills. I am passionate about coding and hands-on technical work. My area of interests includes distributed, event-based, reactive systems, microservices architecture style.
Although I have project management experience and strong communication skills, I am not looking for a role with excessive (more than 25-30%) management or non-technical responsibilities. My preference is to work in and help grow a self-managed team of professionals.
I am not interested in projects with overly rigid processes or bureaucratic systems that leave no room for improvement. For me, ""Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"" is not just a cliché but a core principle.
A positive team atmosphere is essential.
Please note: I will not consider opportunities with companies connected to Russia, Russian businesses, or where Russian language is required for everyday communication. I strongly prefer English or Ukrainian for professional interactions."

This involved implementing new logic, maintaining legacy systems, and working with various AWS services such as ECS, MariaDB, SQS, and MSK. I also played a role in configuring and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
I am eager to join a team that values continuous improvement, embraces new ideas, and is passionate about the projects they work on. I am ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the success of the team
Technologies I have experience with: Java, Spring, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hibernate, myBatis, Grafana, Kafka, AWS (ECS, EKS, MariaDB, SQS, MSK), Docker, k8s, Helm, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, Harness)
I have implemented a library which goal was to run integration tests. We needed it because the used CI tool (Harness) did not support using Docker correctly due to implementation details. So we had environment difference while running integration tests locally and in Harness. Locally you had an access to the docker socket and we could start Docker containers in code, while in Harness containers should have been started ""in background"" before the actual build. The library could check the running environment and operate containers in code if needed
Also I performed the CI tool migration from Jenkins to Harness with help of a devops team. It helped me a lot with understanding how CI/CD process works in practice
I’m always willing to participate in implementing bright and interesting ideas. I like uncovering and mastering new skills, and I believe that this characteristic along with my desire to give as many quality results as possible will bring considerable value to your company
I would not want to work with people who do not want to improve their skills, hear and consider new ideas and approaches"

java,"I have little experience working in a team, but I have already worked on a project in
Softserve thanks to a dual education program with the university. We created a project for small businesses that allows them to create invoices
and manage customers and products. We used various technologies during development,
such as Django REST API, JS, HTML, CSS, Digital Ocean, and design standardization to
Google M3 guidelines. We had a division of work into 5 sprints. We changed roles every
sprint, and in this way everyone was able to try themselves in working with different
technologies. My second work experience was also at SoftServe internship, on a real TeachUA project based on Java Backend and React Frontend. This project is one of a number of projects created for the development of the Ukrainian language and culture. On this project, I improved my ability to work with code review and finding and fixing bugs. Also pulled up training on working on the frontend with the help of React on JavaScript. During this course, we simultaneously performed tasks and gained new knowledge on such topics as Spring Boot, Spring Security, Docker, PostgreSQL, Maven. Another interesting project that I did in a team of two people to develop skills was TaskTracker.
TaskTracker is a project management application that allows users to create and manage tasks. Users can assign different statuses to tasks, such as Execute, In Progress, and Completed. The program also has a calendar function for planning events and activities. In addition, users can register an account and customize their profiles according to their preferences.
During the implementation of the project, I used such technologies as Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT tokens, React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I also worked with GitHub on three projects, made more three hundred commits during the
projects and have some experience in resolving conflicts on branches.
Currently, I`m working on startup project where we have created backend from scratch. Now, we are developing different logics and functionality. At the same time, I`m ready to find new opportunities and challenges, so I am completely open to cooperation and suggestions.
There are not many achievements because of lack of experience, but I can point out few things that I`m proud of.
The first is my success in studies at the university. I always do my best to get maximum from lectures and classes. My efforts are not in vain, every semester I take the highest places in the ranking.
Secondly, I have worked in SoftServe as intern during 6 months. In my opinion it was such a great experience and
it inspired me to learn something new every day.
Finally, I learned a lot on my own. I have taken many courses on Udemy ranging from Spring to Docker and Microservices.
I am committed to continuous learning and hard work as I strive to obtain my first professional job offer.
As a true team player, I would like to have a friendly team where each team member can rely on the other and get advice."

java,"I worked as a Java Backend Developer at IVIA from 2016 to 2025. My main experience is related to developing microservices-based systems, particularly in the logistics domain.
In my most recent project, I was involved in developing a logistics product built on a microservices architecture mostly using a hexagonal architecture. The microservices communicated via HTTP, Kafka, and data replication between databases of different microservices.
The entire backend was implemented using Spring Boot, with PostgreSQL as the database. For deployment and infrastructure management, we used Kubernetes. Jenkins was used as CI/CD tool. AWS was also used as a hosting and as a service provider (SQS, SES, S3, lambdas, DynamoDB, etc.).
My role in the team included developing new features, maintaining existing services, optimizing performance, and integrating new technological solutions (Scaffold, Kafka). Also, I was supporting the legacy project and extracting microservices from the legacy monolith project. When I'm writing my code I'm using Test Driven Design and Domain Driven Design, clean code best practices, most popular design patterns, and SOLID principles.
In the future, I aim to further develop my expertise in high-load distributed systems, enhance my skills in scalable architectures and cloud technologies, and focus on optimizing microservices performance while implementing best practices in backend development.
I've become experienced in:
- Kafka, Kafka connectors
- Kubernetes
- TDD
- DDD
- Extracting microservices from monolith legacy
- Migrating to Spring Boot 3
I am looking for a position where I can work on technically challenging projects, collaborate with a strong engineering team, and continuously improve my skills in backend development. I would like to work with modern technologies, scalable architectures, and cloud-based solutions. Additionally, I value a structured development process, well-defined tasks, and a culture of knowledge sharing within the team.
On the other hand, I would prefer to avoid a chaotic work environment with constant last-minute changes and a lack of clear requirements. I am also not interested in roles with outdated technology stacks or without opportunities for growth and learning."

I designed my own version of the 3D printer Prusa i3 Steel and tried to start a business selling those 3d printers on the internet. I found clients and sold: more than 2 dozen frames, and a dozen 3D printers. But during the whole of that sales process, I understood that I wasn't improving myself anymore.

java,"I have used Java for more than 10 years in automation and test development of robust and verbose automation frameworks. From time to time I switch to Python as needed.
I participated in medical, educational, and job/recruiting projects. I used 3rd party tools to enable/disable the features using feature flags and this approach required a lot of debugging/testing effort, but helped to release multiple features at the same time.
1. I found that customer had VMs running a lot of time on AWS  eating a log of money. So, I confirmed with the manager that we need them, but not 24x7. I shutted them down and developed a script that turns them off after CI job completes and developed another script that checks idling vm's on the weekends and shuts them down if no customer apps are running or it doesn't have label 'DoNotTurnOff'. This saved more than 3000 usd per month.

java,"Маю декілька проектів, розробка яких разом з вивченням java і супутніх технологій надали, на мою думку, необхідних знань для роботи в якості java developer. Два проекти я розроблював у вигляді практичних робіт від курсу Netcracker, а саме: 1) task manager - desktop програма для планування задач на певний час і система сповіщення про необхідність їх виконання; 2) restful weather forecast - додаток, який втілює rest api архітектуру і за допомогою http запитів і стороннього api повертає результат у вигляді json/xml або як word файл. 3) Додаток націлений на допомогу людям, які потребують гуманітарної допомоги - в основі лежить rest архітектура, telegram bot, функціонал якого розроблено на python aiogram та React для front-end частини. Для реалізації двох останніх вищезазначених проектів також використовувався spring boot та jwt.
Маю ступінь бакалавра з комп'ютерних наук, який здобув у Сумському державному університеті. Успішно закінчив 9-ти місячний курс від компанії Netcracker ""розробка мовою Java"". Після закінчення курсу почав потроху виконувати алгоритмічні завдання на leetcode та interviewbit ( в якості мови програмування використовував c++ та java, але це не настільки важливо при розв'язанні подібних завдань), але зрозумів, що необхідно працювати і здобувати навички на реальних проектах і поки що призупинив цю діяльність.

During last 4 years, I’ve grown from Solutions Architect to an Engineering Manager role in a product company. My main duties include product planning, leading, mentoring, coordinating, managing and technically assisting several development teams throughout the whole development lifecycle, which increases their performance and allows the delivery of high-quality product to the end users.
I’m keen on cloud solutions and microservices architecture and have Technical and Team Leadership experience with a background of being Java backend engineer. I’m working to develop scalable and highly available applications for high-volume businesses and sophisticated systems. I like challenges and strive to find creative ways in order to deepen and expand my knowledge of modern tech.
On my last project I have increased the performance of the team due to introduction of Product Support Engineer role separately for backend, frontend and QA teams. Each senior-level member becomes PSE for the spint one by one and is responsible for being available most of the time, monitoring logs and metrics, supporting releases, fixing production and other critical bugs, providing technical expretise for product support team.
Also increased the performance of the application by using GraphQL and introducing read DB replica for all read-only operations with configuring two data sources in Spring Boot application with declarative way of defining repository methods which use replica and which don't.
Also increased the resilience and user expierence of the site by introducing canary deployment. All critical or risky features were deployed for one instance of the app only for a part of the users which allowed to quickly rollback in case of any production issues.
On other project we’ve migrated from monolithic into microservice architecture via middle step, modular monolith. The process also included the migration from Ant to Maven, from SVN to Git, from hand-written Java migrations to Liquibase, from filesystem storage to reliable and secured MongoDB GridFS storage.
During several years of work and different projects I developed many tools/engines including own notification engine on Java, own performance tool for REST app written in Groovy, own database loading tool, also written in Groovy.
I'm interested in creating scalable flexible architectures, leading development teams, technical leadership and require flexible processes to be able to introduce important changes to any team so as to increase the performance of both the application/product and the team.
I’m looking for an interesting project which is built with modern technology stack in cloud (it may be AWS, GCP, Netflix OSS, Docker/Kubernetes or anything similar).

java,"SpringApplication
This SpringCoreProject is an educational project. The main objectives include user registration, sending a token to the mail to confirm the email, display all users after sign in.
JPA Repository is primarily utilized for database interaction. Some methods involve JPQL queries. The services provide opportunities for sending messages to users, to register and search the users, to confirm the tokens (at the same time, it's worth noting, if user didn't pass the confirmation in within a certain number of minutes - the token becomes invalid).
In order to debug the code was added the logging and all log's information will be saved in a file. The services are working with entities, the controllers - with models, that's why before sending information to the controllers, entities are converted to DTO.
Web-controllers navigate between pages, perform checks, and pass information to the services for processing. The access to these controllers are passing via url using REST.
HTML documents display information to users: Thymeleaf is used for dynamic pages, JS and CSS with HTML are used for displaying the table of our entities. Spring Security, along with BCrypt encryption, ensures secure access, and Liquibase is employed for DDL and DML queries.
The application features comprehensive unit and integration test coverage. Profiles differentiate between H2DB (used in development) and PostgreSQL (used in production). Exception handling for user information is profile-dependent, based on the selected environment.
Project setup details, such as MailDev, Hibernate,Liquibase and DBMS, are specified in application*.yml files in the "" resources"" directory, depending on the selected profile.
Workflow
Create database in PostgreSQL DBMS
Change username and password in application-prod.yaml(PostgresSQL) or use application-dev.yaml(h2-console)
Add and run the MailDev in Docker ($ docker run -p 1080:1080 -p 1025:1025 maildev/maildev) ou use my shell script.
Run project
After the registration go to localhost:1080 and confirm the email.
Login in.
After authentication in Postman you get a permit for CRUD requests.

java,"Developed a Robust Backend for an Online Chess Gaming Platform Using Domain-Driven Design
I'm excited to share that I recently completed the backend development for an online chess gaming platform. The project is hosted on GitHub at Haci Haciyev profile.
This backend application, built using Java and the Quarkus framework, provides the core functionality for a chess game. I used a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach to structure the application, focusing on the core chess game domain and its related subdomains, such as user management, game management, and chat.
Some of the key features I implemented include:
User registration and login with email verification
Creating and joining chess games in real-time
Handling game actions such as moves, resignations, and agreements (e.g., draws)
Storing game history and results
Enabling real-time chat between players during matches
Implementing a Glicko2-based rating system to track player skill levels and match them accordingly
The Glicko2 rating system is a widely used algorithm in competitive chess and other games. It allows the platform to dynamically update player ratings based on their performance, ensuring fair and balanced matchmaking.
The backend was developed using a stack of technologies including Java 21, WebSocket, JSON Web Tokens, and PostgreSQL. I focused on designing a scalable and secure architecture to support the needs of the chess gaming community.
Some of the technical challenges I faced and overcame during this project include:
Implementing a robust matchmaking system to pair players of similar skill levels using the Glicko2 algorithm
Ensuring efficient real-time updates on game state and chat messages
Handling various game scenarios like threefold repetition and move returns
Integrating secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using a JWT.
I'm proud of the backend I was able to deliver for this chess gaming platform. It was a rewarding project that allowed me to apply my full-stack development skills and create a solid foundation for an engaging online chess experience.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss the technical details of this project further."

java,"I have an experience in creating and developing a Spring application with REST API.
So the technologies that I was working with while doing that: Java 11, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, MySQL as the main database, Maven for automization, Liquibase for migrations, Apache Kafka for event-driven technology (at the start there was used so-called Internal Messaging System), JUnit and Mockito for testing, Docker for running containes (e. g. for DB and tests), a little bit with Jenkins, UML-diagrams for drawing the visualization of some process that lately was written in code, Git for managing branches with tasks and pushing them to the repository, Jira for managing tasks for each developer.
Also I have a small project I've been developing with my teammates where all these technologies are used.
All in all, I just like software development, because once I get how something works then I can make an analogy or get the logic of it and use it. Actually, that's what programming is!

java,"Junior Per Developer
I have been studying the Perl programming language and has already begun to work.
In the process of practice, I mastered the basics of the OOP, learned to read Legacy Code and learned to work with IDE, and also I worked in the VIM console editor.
Also, during this time I met such technologies as Jira, Fisheye, Trello.
I learned to understand reports and close them, created Code Review and tracked Bugs.
I also gained experience with MySQL - I learned to create SQL requests and read requests.
In addition, I am well oriented on Linux and I like to work in the console.
During training in Java, I worked a lot with Git as part of the team. I continue to study myself
And practice Java. I want to become Back-End Developer and I will continue to develop my Knowledge in the Java in practice.
Здравствуйте!
На последнем месте работы я изучил язык программирования Perl и уже начал работать.
В процессе практики я освоил основы ООП, научился читать legacy код, я научился работать с IDE,
а также я работал в консольном редакторе Vim.
Так же за это время я познакомился с такими технологиями как Jira, Fisheye, Trello.
Научился разбираться в репортах и закрывать их. Создавал code review и отслеживал bugs.
Я также получил опыт работы с MySQL - научился создавать SQL запросы и читать запросы.
К тому же я хорошо ориентируюсь в Linux и мне нравится работать в консоли.
Во время работы я так же проходил курс обучения по Java: мы много работал с Git в составе команды.
Я продолжаю самостоятельно изучать и практиковаться в Java. Мне нравится back-end и я буду продолжать
развивать мои навыки в данном направлении.
В данное время я прохожу обучение в Германии по направлению Java Full-Stack Developer & QA:
https:// www.ait-tr.de/
Мой второй иностранный язык — это немецкий, так же я изучал французский язык.
Английский я использовал для чтения технической литературы, логов и конфигов. Но в последнее время я начал изучать этот язык с преподавателем.
В прошлом - я профессиональный спортсмен и я хорошо знаком с самодисциплиной. Я не пью и не курю.
IT были всегда частью моей жизни, как хобби и я старался всегда саморазвиваться и следить за новыми технологиями.
Я понимаю, что мне нужно ещё многое изучить и ещё больше нужно практиковаться.
Я ищу вакансию, где бы я мог начать работать с моими знаниями начинающего разработчика и развивать мои навыки на практике.
Сейчас я в поиске или работы, или стажировки с возможностью начать работать над проектом.

java,"In my current role as a Java developer, I have completed several projects that have involved a range of technologies and tasks. One of the most significant projects I worked on was a web application that involved developing the front-end using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the back-end using Spring, Hibernate, and MySQL. This project required me to work closely with designers, project managers, and other developers to ensure that the application was user-friendly, efficient, and scalable.
In addition to that, I have also worked on a project involving developing a RESTful API using Spring Boot, MongoDB, and JWT authentication. This project required me to have a deep understanding of Spring Boot and RESTful API design principles.
Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of other technologies, including JPA, Maven, Git, and JUnit.
As for what I want to improve, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in new technologies and tools. In particular, I am interested in learning more about cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, as well as containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest technologies is essential for staying competitive in the field and providing the best solutions for clients. Additionally, I am always looking to improve my communication and collaboration skills to ensure that I can work effectively with team members and stakeholders.
As a Java developer, I have a wide range of experience with various frameworks, tools, and technologies that are relevant to developing web applications. In particular, I have extensive experience with Spring, Hibernate, and HTML/CSS, which I believe would be particularly useful for this proposed project.
In terms of specific examples of past projects, I have worked on a number of Java projects that are similar to this proposed project. For instance, I developed a web-based inventory management system using Spring and Hibernate for a previous employer. Through this project, I gained experience with developing complex web applications that required a high degree of data integrity and security.
My problem-solving skills are also well-developed. I'm particularly skilled at breaking down complex problems into smaller components, and I enjoy collaborating with team members to develop innovative solutions. For example, in another previous project, I was tasked with developing a data visualization tool that required a high degree of accuracy and speed. Through this project, I learned to think critically and creatively to develop a solution that met our client's needs.
In terms of my work process, I'm particularly organized and methodical. I like to break down tasks into smaller components to make them more manageable, and I'm careful to communicate regularly with my team members to ensure that we're all on the same page. Additionally, I'm committed to continuously improving my skills and learning about new technologies and tools that can help me do my job better.
Finally, I'm genuinely excited about this proposed project. I believe that it's an excellent opportunity to apply my skills and experience in a meaningful way, and I look forward to contributing to the project's success in any way that I can.
As a Java developer, I have a clear idea of what I do not want to do in my work. In particular, I am not interested in working on projects that do not align with my values or that involve unethical or illegal activities.
For example, I would not want to work on a project that involves developing software for the purpose of gathering personal data without users' consent or knowledge. I believe strongly in respecting users' privacy and protecting their data, and I would not want to be involved in anything that goes against those values.
Similarly, I would not want to work on a project that involves developing software for a company that engages in unethical business practices, such as environmental damage, labor exploitation, or discrimination. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for positive change, and I want to work on projects that contribute to a better world, not ones that perpetuate harm or injustice.
Additionally, I do not want to work in an environment that is hostile or toxic. I value open communication, collaboration, and respect for others' opinions, and I would not want to work in a place where those values are not shared or respected.
Overall, I believe that it's important to be clear about what we do not want to do in our work as well as what we do want to do. By setting clear boundaries and staying true to our values, we can ensure that we are working on projects that are meaningful, fulfilling, and aligned with our goals and principles."
java,"I am a motivated software developer with 2 years of experience and a comprehensive background in full-cycle development of innovative and flexible microservice applications, using design patterns and unit-testing methodologies. My expertise includes back-end development using Java and Spring Framework and robust database management skills in relational and non-relational databases.
Additionally, I have experience developing front-end components using React and TypeScript.
I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools to further my professional development and provide high-quality solutions to my clients."
java,"I'm a fullstack Java + Angular developer (there's no such notion in our company, but I identify my role as Middle developer). In my current job I participate in development and optimization of Java Spring microservices build with Hibernate as an ORM and PostgreSQL as a datastore. I'm familiar with Docker, as our microservices run in containers. I also take part in development of a UI by creating and using Angular components. Moreover, I'm familiar with aspects of developing Angular libraries.
My biggest achievement in backend developement was  reducing one of the microservices build time by 28%. This was due to me optimizing integration tests, so that they reuse cached application context.
I’m not necessarily looking for a fullstack dev position, I could also work as a backend of frontend developer. A possibility to work from home few days in a week would be nice, however I'm prepared to a full office job. Health insurance provided by company would be greatly appreciated too."

java,"My passion for programming started in the fifth grade of school, when we started learning the basics of algorithms in computer science classes using Scratch block programming. Later we switched to Pascal, and it was then that I realized that programming was what I wanted to do and what I was really interested in.
At university, I was introduced to low-level Assembler language, which allowed me to understand how a computer works at the machine level. After a while I started to actively learn C++, which became my main programming tool. Thanks to this language, I learned to understand algorithms written in most programming languages (except esoteric ones).
In the process of learning, I realized many projects in different programming languages. These ranged from simple console applications, such as bubble sort and quick sort, to more complex programs on Windows Forms and web applications with databases. One of my accomplishments was creating a custom web application from the To Do category.
I then decided to try my hand at mobile development and chose native iOS development. I first created simple 1-2 screen projects in Xcode, and later I developed from scratch a contact management application with authoring solutions, fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem.
I am willing to discuss salary at the start of the job as experience is paramount to me. All of my current skills are based on solving software related problems on my own. I strive to constantly update my own biological firmware, so I am open to new knowledge. It is very important for me to work in a friendly team where there will be friends, not just colleagues."

java,"I have around 5 years of experience in programming. I mostly worked on the back end of the development using Java, Spring, REST, etc., and do many tasks using these technologies. I can solve tasks by applying the best programming practices. Besides, I have a strong understanding of OOP principles and experience in applying patterns. I love making things work as expected on time. I am interested in an active lifestyle, and complex tasks that are ready to perform. Quickly adapting to new environments, and new technologies, and facing new challenges.
My main accomplishment in my last job is refactoring the payment system, so the data about clients' products and rate plans are stored in the cloud, not hardcoded in our codebase. With this improvement, we no longer need to deploy the code when the client decides to change the rate plan price. The whole process (implementation, testing, deployment) could take up to 3 days. Now it's just updating the field in the payment system cloud and evicting the cache using an admin endpoint. The whole process takes up to 15 mins which is a huge difference
My main goal is to apply my programming skills and improve them by being a part of a software development team, obtaining experience, and delivering services and products, which meet client's needs. One of my objectives is constant professional growth and keeping track of new technologies and software development practices."

java,"Site ""Matrix Calculator""
It was written using Java Spring (Back-end) and React (Front-end) technologies. I wrote the back-end part using Spring Boot as a basis. It was a service that, based on data from the frontend, calculated data in business logic and sent it back to the frontend via a REST API. I was also the one who coordinated what data we would exchange using DTO. Own algorithms for data processing and matrix calculation were written. Also, everything was tested using JUnit.
Web application for the library
It was implemented using Hibernate and Spring Data JPA. However, in the beginning I decided to use low-level technologies such as JDBC API and JdbcTemplate. The web application for the library was created using Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf was used as a templator to represent the models. PostgreSQL was chosen as the database, and all database queries were created using JdbcTemplate. Relationships between entities are organized in a one-to-many pattern: one person can have many books, but a book can belong to only one person.
Hibernate and Spring Data JPA were used to improve the application. Further, no SQL query was used in the project. For specific requests, DAOs were used, in which HQL commands were written.
A service that works with a weather sensor
It was implemented using Spring Boot. This sensor measures the temperature of the surrounding air and can determine if it is raining. Every time it takes a measurement, it will send an HTTP request with data in JSON format to our server. For this, in real life, we would specify the IP address of the computer where we are running the Spring REST API application to the device.
Individuals are responsible for registering a new sensor. Each user of our service needs to undergo authentication and authorization, which is implemented using Spring Security.
Functionality for receiving data from the sensor, for example, a temperature graph, has also been created. After receiving 1000 temperature measurements from the server, you can use the XChart library to plot the graph.
PostgreSQL was chosen as the database."
java,"My experience is based on pet project development. I am building an application with a microservices architecture that provides a REST API for converting audio and video files. I`m using Netflix Eureka for service discovery, and Spring Cloud Gateway for routing, rate limiting, and authentication with JWT tokens. I utilize Redis to limit the number of requests, ensure idempotency, and provide basic caching. AWS S3 is used for file storage. The main converter service is based on the JAVE2 library. I use RabbitMQ between a fast microservice that handles requests and a slower converter microservice. PostgreSQL provides long-term data storage. The entire stack is deployed using Docker Compose. JUnit5 for testing. Using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
I am seeking a full-time opportunity to join a team of experienced developers, where I can contribute and grow.
I expect adequate onboarding, straight forward communication about expectations and clear overtime policy."

I’m proud that my employer values the work I do.
I’m proud that we handle the workload of an entire department with a small team.
I’m proud that the quality of our work is consistently high.
I’m proud that I worked on optimizing reports. Initially, the reports took over two to three minutes to generate, but after optimization, they started building in less than 10 seconds.
I’m proud that I write tests to cover the code, describing various business scenarios. On one project, there was a situation where the architect wanted to quickly make changes to the code. However, he couldn’t do it easily because the code was well-covered with tests. The architect, somewhat jokingly, scolded us, saying he wanted to make the changes in 15 minutes, but it took him 2 hours instead, as the tests prevented any changes that would break functionality.
I’m proud that clients have told my managers, “Call Sasha; he’ll fix it” when something wasn’t working. On another project, the manager said, “Keep Sasha on my project; he’s incredibly valuable and does the majority of the work.”

In the context of the ""Lyrics Search"" project, Spring MVC is utilized to create various endpoints that expose functionalities such as song search, lyrics submission, chart viewing, and more. REST serves as the underlying architecture for the web service, enabling clients to make requests to these endpoints and exchange data between the client and server using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
The project incorporates Java (version 17) and utilizes Spring Boot (version 3.1.0) as the main framework. Spring Security is employed for authentication and authorization purposes, ensuring secure access to the system. Additionally, JPA is used for interacting with the database."

Experiencе
PROJECT: Integration of SAS Fraud Management System.
This project was aimed to implement system that analyzes all transactions from our bank client and prevents or puts on hold any fraud cases or suspicions activity.
My job was to create proxy layer (I called it adapter-fms) and for all bank transactions to go through that adapter. Its job would be to receive REST requests from our bank services, accumulate necessary data along the way and send it to SAS FMS.
Also, I needed this adapter to work fast and ensure that responses will be returned under 1 second. So, for that reason I used multithreading and caching.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2), worked with bank core system (flex cube), used Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queuing, PostgreSQL.
PROJECT: Ordering salary cards online.
This project was about providing our customers with the opportunity to order salary cards online.
My responsibilities were to create business logic, write unit tests, calls to DB, provide REST Api’s for front end developers.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2), some parts were written with Golang and Kotlin, worked with bank core system (flex cube), used Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queuing, PostgreSQL.
PROJECT: Quiz app for English courses.
This project was about to provide our clients with tools to create quizzes.
My job was to create admin panel where users can create blog entries, quizzes, choose its type (free or exclusive for course students), edit them, activate (so it would appear on students side). Also, here we have store section, where admins can add products which users can buy with coins, received from completing quizzes. Also developed user side, where we can register on the site, complete quizzes and collect points and coins, buy stuff on store, see leaderboard.
To create this project, I used technologies such as Java (Spring Boot 2) and Golang, implemented logic to store quiz images and videos on the cloud (digital ocean), also write adapter-mail-sender for internal purposes.
Developed bank web application module related to memorandum generation for mortgage contracts. Worked with bank core system (flex cube), directly communicated with clients, designers. The best part was getting gratitude from bank workers because our application made their life much more easier."

java,"I have created several pet projects, each showcasing different technologies and functionalities.
The first is the currency converter. The project takes currencies from which an amount will be converted to a chosen currency. I used Spring Framework (Spring Boot), and for obtaining currency exchange rates from currencyapi.com. The front-end was developed using Angular to gain familiarity with the technology and understand the communication between the back-end and front-end. The back-end was written in Java, while the front-end utilized HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
The second is the application to show distance on the map and show the weather forecasts for departure and destination points. Users input two values: the departure and destination locations. The application then shows the current forecast for both locations and the distance in kilometers. Requests are limited to five per IP per day. The back-end was built with the Spring Framework (Spring Boot), and weather data was sourced from openWeatherMap. The map was displayed using the Google Maps API. The back-end was written in Java, and the front-end was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which managed the Google Maps API and extracted weather forecast data from the back-end.
The third project, still in development, provides cooking recipes. It uses the Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Security), PostgreSQL for the database, and Angular for the front-end, which I am using to further learn the technology"

Job expectations:
I expect a job to provide opportunities for professional development, including learning, mentorship, and participation in real-world projects.

What I Want to Avoid in a Job:
At the same time, I would prefer not to work in an environment lacking proper support or mentorship, as this could make it challenging to develop at the start of my career. Routine or uninteresting tasks without learning opportunities are demotivating, as is the absence of clear structure or organized processes. Working in a toxic team or facing excessive workloads due to unrealistic deadlines is particularly undesirable. I believe the beginning of a career is a time for growth, and I hope to find a place where that growth is actively encouraged."

Протягом курсу я виконував різноманітні проекти та завдання, зокрема розробляв прості веб-додатки, працював з базами даних та освоював принципи об'єктно-орієнтованого програмування. Для реалізації проектів використовував такі технології, як Java SE, JDBC, SQL, а також основи HTML і CSS для фронтенду.
Моя роль у команді полягала в аналізі вимог, розробці коду та тестуванні створених рішень. Я активно взаємодіяв з іншими студентами та менторами, що дозволило покращити мої навички командної роботи та комунікації.
Моїм основним завданням було вирішення практичних завдань, написання ефективного коду та оптимізація існуючих рішень. У процесі навчання я здобув досвід у використанні систем контролю версій (Git), що дозволило мені краще організовувати роботу над проектами.
Зараз я прагну розвиватися в напрямку розробки корпоративних додатків, удосконалюючи свої знання в області Spring Framework та Hibernate. Моя мета — стати професійним Java-розробником, здатним працювати над складними та масштабними проектами, забезпечуючи високу якість та продуктивність програмного забезпечення.

Маю практичні навички роботи з Java Core, Java 8, Spring Boot, Spring Security + JWT (на базовому рівні), Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Boot Data JPA, Docker, PostgreSQL, а також тестуванням із використанням JUnit і Mockito. Маю розуміння Spring Core та Hibernate.
У своїх проєктах я реалізовував RESTful веб-застосунки, де розробляв CRUD-операції, фільтрацію даних, пагінацію та інші функціональності. Налаштовував механізми аутентифікації та авторизації через JWT.Використовував Flyway для міграцій баз даних.
Також маю досвід налаштування логування і обробки помилок шляхом AOP і генерації документації для API (OpenAPI/Swagger). Писав модульні та інтеграційні тести з використанням JUnit і Mockito, а також тестував RESTful API через Postman.
Маю досвід роботи з мікросервісною архітектурою: перевів монолітний застосунок на мікросервіси, розбивши його на окремі сервіси, кожен із яких виконує свою бізнес-логіку.
Для керування сервісами використовував Eureka Server, а для маршрутизації запитів — API Gateway.Централізовано керував конфігурацією мікросервісів через Spring Cloud Config. Для взаємодії між сервісами застосовував OpenFeign, що спрощувало реалізацію HTTP-запитів.
Також маю розуміння Apache Kafka і поки що невеликий досвід налаштування продюсерів і консюмерів для обміну повідомленнями між мікросервісами.
Я створив кілька пет-проєктів. Один із них - онлайн-бібліотека, розроблена з використанням Spring MVC, JPA та Security. У цьому проєкті контролери повертали в'юшки, REST API не використовувався. Інший проєкт - REST API, який повертав JSON, тестувався через Postman. В обох проєктах дотримувався принципів ООП, SOLID, та працював із базою даних PostgreSQL.
Також маю досвід роботи з мікросервісною архітектурою: перевів монолітний застосунок на мікросервіси, розбивши його на незалежні сервіси, кожен із яких виконував свою бізнес-логіку і мав свою бд. Використовував Eureka Server для реєстрації сервісів та їхнього виявлення, застосовував API Gateway для маршрутизації запитів. Централізовано керував конфігурацією через Spring Cloud Config. Використовував OpenFeign для взаємодії між мікросервісами, що спрощувало реалізацію HTTP-запитів. Працював із Apache Kafka, налаштовував продюсери та консюмери для асинхронного обміну повідомленнями між мікросервісами, що покращувало продуктивність та масштабованість системи.
Я очікую приєднатися до гарної команди, де цінується підтримка та співпраця. Готовий наполегливо навчатися, вдосконалювати свої технічні навички та активно брати участь у розвитку проєктів компанії.
Розумію, що на початковому етапі мого кар'єрного шляху буде виникати багато питаннь, тому цінуватиму конструктивний зворотний зв'язок і наставництво від більш досвідчених колег.

In this time I learned a lot from senior developers even though they were remote. I would often write and ask questions and they were nice people they helped me in my first steps. Now thanks to them I am now a lot more comfortable and experienced in writing Spring Boot applications. I know that I improved myself because I now ask less questions, in a way that  I can manage more stuff myself now. And I believe I am now ready for next challenge. I want to challenge myself in remote work.
As a junior developer I developed a project myself called VoltPay which is used in Azerbaijan by Wolt couriers for cashing out their money. And I also took part in Pulse and IBEX projects and fixed many bugs and added new features. They are used by Bolt and Uber drivers and Fleets.
After a substantial development of my skills in just a matter of few months I am expecting more in the future of course. My main expectation is to have a chance to be in an environment where I can improve myself more. My short term expectation from myself is to find new job where  I could gain more experience."

java,"After a series of courses and trainings, I realized that java is more than just a programming language - it's an ecosystem of tools that covers everything you might need in development.
An object-oriented language allows you to expand your capabilities. Starting with Java 8, even more features and capabilities have appeared.
And the most common spring framework makes the language one of the leading ones on the labor market.
I got my initial experience at the university and on external courses. These were educational projects that can be seen on my Git. My next experience was working on a real project as a Junior. Where I interacted with technologies: Maven, JUnit, JDBC,
MongoDB, JSON, REST API, AWS, Design Patterns, Lombok, Spring (Boot, MVC, Security, Data).
More than a year later, I changed my project where I expanded my technology stack and had a chance to work with Azure Service Bus, Integration Testing, Hibernate, Mockito, Quarkus, Swagger API.
Another year later, I received a promotion and changed my project, where I customized the existing project using previously acquired technologies. Here I had the opportunity to improve hard skills and soft skills.
It is important for a good developer to be able to google!
I try to maintain the level of knowledge in the state in which they are needed, and surrounded by colleagues of a higher level, I gladly adopt only the useful.

java,"I have been dedicated to expanding my expertise in Java, particularly within the Spring Framework, through personal projects and university studies involving C, C++, and Go.
At first project as java developer, I made significant contributions to a legacy project, integrating features like 1-2-1 customer communication and team meeting functionalities. Leveraging Spring Framework, AWS S3, and AWS RDS, I also engaged in frontend development using AJAX, Bootstrap, and jQuery. My responsibilities extended to test writing and maintenance using JUnit and Mockito.
Advancing to a higher developer role, I undertook the challenge of migrating the legacy project from Servlet to Spring Boot, employing JUnit, Mockito, and Docker for testing and containerization. Concurrently, I delved into AWS technologies, including RDS, EC2, S3, ECS, and SQS, and wrote infrastructure scripts with Terraform.
At my second role as dev at a HealthCare project, I was actively involved in Java/Kotlin development, focusing on creating new functionality, APIs, bug fixes, and customer communication. Technologies employed encompass FHIR (Azure), Kotlin, PostgreSQL, Sonar, Docker, Kafka, MockK for testing, KeyCloak, and microservices architecture.
On current role, I work on maintaining and extending a legacy system built with Java. My responsibilities include adding new functionality, implementing external integrations with REST APIs, and optimizing existing code. The project is characterized by its complex business logic, requiring a deep understanding of the domain and precise implementation of requirements.

java,"Релевантний досвід:
Мій комерційний досвід поки що обмежується стажуванням у компанії Flai Analytics. Моєю основною задачею було самостійно розробити мобільний застосунок із нуля:
- спроєктувати та налаштувати базу даних,
- створити сервер для REST API,
- розробити клієнтський інтерфейс.
До цього, на початку повномасштабного вторгнення, я почав вивчати Python і SQL через онлайн-курси, але з часом переключився на Java. Пройшов навчання в Epam Campus, після чого вирішив спробувати себе в мобільній розробці на Flutter. Це й привело мене до стажування у Flai Analytics.
Окрім цього, самостійно працював над pet-проєктами, де:
- написав програму Розумна підписка  - підписується на людину в соц мережі, якщо вона не відповідає взаємністю через певний період то людина додається в чорний список і від неї автоматично відписуються (Python + Selenium, свого часу мені потрібно було підняти кількість підписників в соц мережі),
- написав базовий голосовий помічник для Windows (розпізнає голос, вмикає, вимикає компʼютер, відкриває названні застосунки),
- розробляв легкі сервери на Python Django,
- виконував тестові завдання від компаній Ajax та InForce (тестування через Apium та ETL pipeline).
Прагну розвиватися у напрямку мобільної розробки та бекенду.
Нерелевантний досвід:
Розпочав кар'єру на сімейному підприємстві з міжнародних вантажних перевезень, де пройшов шлях від вантажника та слюсаря до молодшого механіка, а згодом — заступника директора.
Мої обов’язки включали:
закупівлю та облік ремонтних запчастин,
системне адміністрування (оновлення конфігурацій 1С, створення резервних копій бази даних, оновлення ПЗ, вирішення hardware/software проблем),
роботу з первинною документацією,
участь у тендерах та пошук заявок на Ларді Транс,
координацію ремонтів вантажівок (DAF XF 105).
У підлітковому віці працював копірайтером для трьох видань:
будівельного блогу,
онлайн-журналу про життя та технології,
одеського магазину електроніки QWERTY Shop.
Також у певний період поєднував роботу в сімейному бізнесі з роботою в мережі магазинів Траш.
Після звільнення пробував себе в різних сферах: працював експедитором та customer support у американській компанії.
Горджуся тим, що зміг самостійно створити мобільний застосунок майже без зовнішньої підтримки, а також:
- самостійно навчився грати на піаніно,
- вступив на бюджет до найкращого коледжу свого міста,
- потрапив на стипендію,
- писав статті для сайту коледжу,
- у 20 років власноруч збудував фронтон будинку (15 кв. м, на висоті 9 м).
Хоч ці пункти і не стосуються напряму IT, демонструють мою здатність до самостійного навчання та досягнення цілей.
Я усвідомлюю, що для сучасного IT-ринку в Україні мій досвід ще недостатній, тому шукаю компанію, де зможу себе проявити та розвиватися як спеціаліст.
Мені важлива:
можливість навчання та професійного росту,
команда, з якою приємно працювати,
чітка організація процесів.
Після досвіду роботи в сімейному бізнесі для мене must-have – це прозорі робочі процеси та стабільність. Не хотів би опинитися в ситуації, коли робочий графік хаотичний: то немає роботи по кілька днів, то доводиться працювати без вихідних.
Буду радий знайти компанію, де мої навички та прагнення до розвитку будуть цінуватися!"

java,"In my current role as the Head of the IT department at my company, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and tasks, drawing on my extensive background as a CTO, IT consultant, and web developer. Despite my managerial responsibilities, I still actively participate as a full-stack developer, which allows me to stay connected with the technical aspects of our projects. My primary focus is on improving my development skills and gaining international knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology.
Throughout my career, I've been involved in diverse projects, with a notable presence in the educational and health sectors. In these domains, I've designed and implemented various solutions, some of which involved survey algorithms for data collection and processing. These surveys were crucial in generating certificates and reports, enhancing the efficiency of educational programs and healthcare services.
One of the noteworthy projects I've worked on involved developing a platform to support psychologists and streamline their work. This platform caters to the needs of teenagers and young adults seeking help with their psychological health issues. Users can submit their requests and concerns through the website, which is then accessible to our team of psychologists. These professionals can interact with the users, provide counseling, and maintain comprehensive records of each case directly within the system.
Currently, my main focus is on updating and enhancing this website to ensure it continues to meet the evolving needs of our users and psychologists. This involves improving user experience, enhancing data security, and integrating new technologies to support remote counseling and data analysis.
In terms of what I aim to improve, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge of development practices, keeping up with emerging technologies, and gaining international insights into IT trends and best practices. Additionally, I am eager to explore ways to enhance the scalability and performance of our projects, ensuring they can effectively serve a growing user base.
My experience as a head of the IT department has been rewarding, but I remain deeply committed to my roots as a developer and am excited about the opportunities to further refine my skills while contributing to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on education and healthcare.
Psychological Health Support Platform:
In my current role as the Head of IT, I played a pivotal role in the development of a platform aimed at providing psychological support to teenagers and young adults.
Details: We introduced features like save user info and reports of psychologist about these users. This resulted in a 30% increase in user engagement, with more teenagers seeking help and receiving timely support from trained professionals. The platform received recognition from local mental health organizations for its positive impact.
Mentoring and Team Growth:
As a leader, I take pride in the growth and development of my team members.Through mentorship and training initiatives, I've seen junior developers progress to senior roles and contribute significantly to the success of our projects. This has created a dynamic and skilled team capable of handling complex challenges and delivering high-quality solutions consistently.
My expectations revolve around continuous learning, meaningful work, leadership, international exposure, efficiency, and team growth. Conversely, I aim to avoid stagnation, isolation, a narrow focus, resistance to innovation, unfulfilling projects, and micromanagement in my career."

java,"I have extensive experience with Java and have worked on several projects where I utilized various tools and technologies. Here is a combined description of my Java experience and the tools you used:
In one of my pet projects, I developed a university-JDBC application. I designed and implemented a dynamic database system using PostgreSQL to effectively manage student, group, and course information. Leveraging the power of JDBC, I seamlessly connected the university application with the PostgreSQL database, enabling smooth data retrieval, modification, and insertion. To enhance user experience, I also created a console menu that provided convenient options for editing information.
Another noteworthy project I worked on involved developing an university application using Spring MVC, which was seamlessly integrated with PostgreSQL. This powerful combination allowed for efficient retrieval and management of information related to students, groups, courses, teachers, and events through an admin panel. To ensure effective relational data management, I utilized JPA and Hibernate. Additionally, I implemented Thymeleaf to create user-friendly pages, and Spring Security to guarantee authorization.
Furthermore, I applied my Java skills in a project focused on managing car information. Leveraging Spring MVC, I developed an application that integrated with PostgreSQL, providing a robust database management system for storing and retrieving car data. To simplify the data access layer, I utilized JPA with Hibernate. For enhanced security, I incorporated Keycloak into the project, ensuring proper authorization.
In terms of deployment and environment consistency, I utilized Docker to create a Docker image for the car management application. This approach streamlined the deployment process and maintained consistency across different environments, making it easier for potential users to set up the application. Additionally, I integrated Swagger into the Car Microservice App, providing users with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Swagger proved invaluable for documenting and visualizing the API, allowing users to effortlessly explore and understand the application's functionalities.
I obtained my skills through the Java Spring Development course offered by Foxminded. During the course, I had the opportunity to work with two mentors who checked all my tasks and projects that required the aforementioned skills throught GitLab.  I am proud to have completed this Java course where I was tasked with various coding challenges and required to conduct extensive research to find solutions. My certificate represents my dedication to mastering Java programming skills and my ability to deliver quality work.
As a Java developer, my main expectations would include designing, developing, and maintaining Java-based applications such as:

Also I continue to learn and take courses in IT school (already have 5 certificates - not only Java, also i graduated Front end course JS+React, TS)
I'm really happy I found direction where I can constantly develop myself and get more and more new knowledge."
java,"From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a Java Full-Stack Developer for GK Software on the MCA (Mobile Consumer Assistant) project. The project was a consumer engagement solution that enabled retailers to communicate with their digital consumers in real-time, providing personalized and interactive communication that could be done anytime and anywhere. The solution offered consumer loyalty, couponing, and digital communication capabilities.
From 2021 to the present, I work as a Senior Java SE on NDA, a data streaming platform aggregating real-time sports betting information from multiple providers. The platform collects and delivers critical information such as events, markets, prices, and game state and result data to end customers, providing them with a seamless and immersive betting experience.
Through these two projects, I gained extensive knowledge of the retail and betting domains. My experience includes working with various technologies and approaches such as Java 11, Spring Boot, Hibernate & JPA, Apache Kafka, Java EE (JBoss EAP & WildFly), PostgreSQL & SAP HANA, DbMaintain, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Microservice Architecture, OpenAPI, and AngularJS. I have experience in designing and implementing scalable, robust, and high-performance solutions using these technologies. In addition, I have worked with agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban.
MCA:
- Designed and developed MVP features, which improved the system's functionality and increased customer engagement.
- Successfully decoupled two enormous JBoss monoliths into lightweight microservices based on Spring Boot framework and Wildfly Application Server, improving reduction in system maintenance and startup times.
- Optimized legacy code and SQL-queries performance (PostgreSQL, SAP HANA), sometimes resulting in improvements in several hundred in system speed on average.
- Migrated the system into the cloud on top of Kubernetes, mitigating any issues that arose during the migration.
- Improved performance of the DWH of the system, resulting in in reduced data retrieval time and the decreased load on the database.
- Designed APIs for new services utilizing an API First approach, using OpenAPI specification.
Refactored existing Ansible playbooks for legacy system deployment changes, resulting in a more streamlined and maintainable deployment configuration.
- Developing of the web client for the back-office of the system with AngularJS framework.
NDA:
- Integrated several feed providers by consuming their APIs, as well as the integration of new sports, such as racing, which had unique data types compared to traditional match-type sports.
- Played a key role in developing the system's feed outage handling capabilities. This involved ensuring that markets were immediately closed when feed providers were down, preventing potential data gaps or inconsistencies that could affect our customers. I also worked on notifying traders about the outages, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the available information.
- Improvement in our automatic market pricing components: I enhanced the configuration capabilities of the automatic market pricing components, providing our traders with more flexibility to adjust pricing according to market demands. These improvements resulted in better risk management and allowed us to provide more competitive pricing to our customers.
- My extensive knowledge and experience with the system quickly led to my selection as a member of the steward community. In this role, I actively participated in code and architecture design reviews, providing valuable insights and suggestions. I assisted other teams with their analysis, leveraging my expertise in the system to help identify areas for improvement and optimization
As someone who values working with cutting-edge technologies and a team that follows best practices, I am seeking a job that aligns with these preferences. I have extensive experience with Spring but I'm ready to work with others like Micronaut and Quarkus(I'm especially fond of it) Additionally, I am passionate about microservice architecture and would love to work with a team that has experience in building distributed systems.
I am looking for a well-established company that has a clear structure and process in place. I'm also ready to develop from scratch. Overall, I am seeking a job that provides me with the opportunity to work with modern technologies, a strong team, and a focus on microservice architecture."

- Development of a real estate advertizing site. I was part of a team that implemented functional and other requirements of backend services. Microservices were coupled with event sourcing and CQRS patterns.
- Extended existing bank system with leading digital banking platform capabilities. Tasks were defined as implementation of one banking microservice at a time. The team was practicing Scrum and agile methodology throughout the project life-cycle.
In Infobip I am assigned to the voice team where we work on the TTS (text to speech) and IVR(Interactive voice response) products.
We are responsible for developing new functionalities and mangaing the existing ones. The products consist of multiple microservices which are deployed on many data-centers around the world. The products are used by big clients such as Uber, Microsoft, BMW and many more, which is an additional motivator keep the platform stable and mantain high delivery rate of the voice messages. I use Java and spring for the backend services in my day to day work. Besides these we use various technologies and patters in order to make the product competitive in the market. Besides the development we also monitor the existing product using tools like prometheus metrics and grafana graphs in order to ensure stability at all times. For deployments we use an internal tool, a thing to note is that as each ticket is finished the changes are deployed immediately to production, which is why we make sure that everything works as expected and no bugs are introduced. As we work on such a big platform deployed around the world, I have the chance to solve many challenges that come with large scale distributed systems.
Skills used in these projects were:
Java 8,11
Spring (Spring boot, Cloud...)
JPA(Hibernate)

certain positions could be sent for training only on the days that were
prescribed in the terms of reference.
Tournaments: I implemented them from scratch. They had such
functionality as generating a list of opponents that searched the
database for users whose rating was within a certain range I also
implemented the game itself in which we chose which opponent we
wanted to play with and which of our away teams would play depending
on whether we won or lost, the rating changed.

java,"While I was learning Java core and Java Web, I worked on several real-world projects that allowed me to apply my skills and gain practical experience. One of the most significant projects was a student tracker app, where I was responsible for designing and implementing the backend system using Spring Boot. I used technologies like Java, Spring Framework, Hibernate, and MySQL to build a robust and scalable application. My role involved collaborating closely with frontend developers and ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend.
In another project, I developed a simple e-commerce website where I handled both frontend and backend tasks. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Java with Spring Boot for the backend. This project gave me hands-on experience with RESTful APIs, data persistence, and user authentication.
I excelled in backend development and database management but would like to improve my frontend skills, particularly in modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. In my next role, I aim to further enhance my problem-solving abilities and gain more experience in full-stack development.
During my learning journey, I successfully completed several projects that showcased my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. For instance, in the student tracker app, I implemented a complex user authentication system that significantly enhanced the security of the application. This involved using Spring Security and JWT tokens, which was a challenging but rewarding experience.
I also improved the performance of the e-commerce website by optimizing database queries and implementing efficient data caching techniques. This resulted in faster load times and a better user experience, which was recognized by my instructors and peers.

From trainee I growed up to Team Lead position, what is not so easy in Playtika.
After playtika I deep dive into close to me development sphere and became junior java full stack developer in the Terum group, where I got a good knowledges of development flows.
-I was studied as Java Dev. After successful finish IT Academy the first interview I got was QC position in BI sphere and my direction from java moved to Data engineering. That's the place where I got a good expertise in sql when I rised to BI developer.
Migration databases and design sourcefile parsers on java, python and R was my responsibility.
-After daily routine with sql I moved to Playtika NOC department. Its a step from small company to a huge one, multicultural and self-product company.
-Now I am Lead of NOC department but...
Still I wanna be a professional Java developer. and to fill a knowledge gaps I hired mentor of Java and still working with him to improve java skills.
- With growing some java skills I started to implement java solution for automatization daily workflows, designed an app for team analysis, and took part in global department project as DBA.
But as all these projects just a proactivity.
So I decided to make a step to what I really like to do. To development. I am sure my experience and passion will help me to grow fast.
I am expecting to find a friendly and professional team, cooperation with, I could grow, design stable prod and be useful for business."

biggest takeaway from the project would be the crucial experience I got on cloud
computing (AWS) and microservices as a whole.
3. E-commerce platform.
Development/Bug-fixing - optimized multiple processes within the project (using
caching, moving data processing from database to Java, optimizing SQL queries, using
external bulk API calls instead of single-item, etc.).
4. Legacy Inventory system for Telecom.
Customer support - I was a part of a customer support rotation. The tasks varied from
application server configuration to database script generation issues.
Bug fixing - We had to support older versions of the product, which were shipped as early
as 2014. This required a lot of non-trivial solutions and thinking as code base has changed
a lot over the time.
Development - got some hands-on experience on popular technologies.
1. I have contributed into internal-use module (general scripts used for building AWS infrastructure) by extending its' functionality to allow the use of different EC2 Load Balancers. This gave me important knowledge and experience in building infrastructure and AWS as a whole.
