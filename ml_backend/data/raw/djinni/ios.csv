I try to be someone my teammates can count on, and I'm always looking for ways to get better and write cleaner, more maintainable code.
At my current job, I’ve had the chance to work on a bunch of cool projects that helped me grow a lot as a developer. Here are a few of them:
Network & Environmental Scanner:
I built an app that scans for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and EMF signals using Core Bluetooth and Core Motion. I used async/await to handle scanning and data processing at the same time, saved the results with Core Data and UserDefaults, and added subscription analytics with AppsFlyer and RevenueCat.
Location Safety App:

Coin Recognition App:
I created an app that recognizes coins using the camera and the ChatGPT API. I handled image uploads securely with Firebase Storage and managed user preferences with UserDefaults.
Audio Extractor + Offline Player
This one lets users extract audio from websites and play it offline. I used WebKit and WebViews to load sites and reverse engineered the audio stream. Then I built a simple audio player with AVAudioPlayer and stored everything locally with Core Data.
I worked closely with both the UI and QA teams to bring everything together, often under tight deadlines. Making sure the design looked great and the app ran smoothly was always a top priority - and I think we always did a great job.

ios,"I have 5+ years of experience in iOS and Flutter development across wellbeing, tourism, fintech, and medtech domains.
I have:
- Released 2 iOS apps written from scratch (SwiftUI/UIKit, Combine, SQLite, CoreLocation, GoogleMaps, MapKit, AVFoundation);
- Maintained an old legacy Objective-C project and partially migrated it to Swift using a ""modularization"" approach (UIKit/SwiftUI, SQLite, WidgetKit, SiriKit, MapKit, UserNotifications, CoreLocation);
- Implemented new features and designs for iOS, WatchOS, and cross-platform Flutter apps;
- Worked with embedded devices and BLE.
In all projects I've worked on, I used the functional reactive approach (RxSwift, Combine, RxDart). I find functional programming as a paradigm very interesting.
When I worked on a fintech project, we used UIKit, as SwiftUI was released recently. I created wrappers for UIKit that resembled SwiftUI. This allowed us to create UIKit UI using a declarative approach with RxSwift. I developed and tested the solution, and we implemented it in the project.
When SwiftUI was first released, I began a new project using it. One of the challenges I faced was using UserDefaults without complications. To address this, I created ""AppStorage"" before Apple released their own version. My solution works starting from iOS 13.3, while Apple's version requires iOS 14.
For my upcoming work, I'm interested in a full-time role focusing on a SwiftUI & Combine-based app, ideally using The Composable Architecture or a similar functional method.
From this job, I'm looking for:
- Chances to improve my skills in SwiftUI, Combine, and functional programming;
- A friendly team that supports learning and development;
- Learning about different fields, broadening my understanding of the industry;
- Being part of decisions on app structure and technology selection;
- A balance between demanding tasks and my personal time;
- A dedication to good practices, quality coding, and constant progress."

Drawing app, eSport, VoIP, social networks, healthcare projects, CRM(Report side), and for farming :)
Recent projects was considered on using SwiftUI / Combine frameworks, with MVVM architecture.
I started develop apps with MRC(not so long, but 1-1.5 years i developed apps without ARC), so i think that i understand a rules of retaining objects, memory leaks, and how avoid it. Sometimes i asked for support legacy frameworks on ObjectiveC, so still remember it syntax, and can resolve issues.
The last three years i work with RxSwift, Realm, Alamofire, SwiftLint, Firebase(i don't use it only for Crashlytics, one app was builded for using Firebase, Firestorage, and functions)
I get some experience also working with TensorFlow Lite, i developed from scratch module for object segmentation, with pretrained model, this app was like replacement for chromakey.
I used and continue using a lot of 3rd party frameworks for analytics, location, databases, network, UI,  reactive development.

ios,"My passion for programming started in the fifth grade of school, when we started learning the basics of algorithms in computer science classes using Scratch block programming. Later we switched to Pascal, and it was then that I realized that programming was what I wanted to do and what I was really interested in.
At university, I was introduced to low-level Assembler language, which allowed me to understand how a computer works at the machine level. After a while I started to actively learn C++, which became my main programming tool. Thanks to this language, I learned to understand algorithms written in most programming languages (except esoteric ones).
In the process of learning, I realized many projects in different programming languages. These ranged from simple console applications, such as bubble sort and quick sort, to more complex programs on Windows Forms and web applications with databases. One of my accomplishments was creating a custom web application from the To Do category.
I then decided to try my hand at mobile development and chose native iOS development. I first created simple 1-2 screen projects in Xcode, and later I developed from scratch a contact management application with authoring solutions, fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem.
I am willing to discuss salary at the start of the job as experience is paramount to me. All of my current skills are based on solving software related problems on my own. I strive to constantly update my own biological firmware, so I am open to new knowledge. It is very important for me to work in a friendly team where there will be friends, not just colleagues."
