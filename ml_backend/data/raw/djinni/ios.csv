ios,"За цей час я працював над власними проєктами, серед яких: CoreList, Arinfor та Caflact.
1. CoreList — платформа для пошуку та надання послуг у різних сферах. Користувачі могли створювати свої пропозиції, додавати послуги до обраного, записуватись на них із вибором дати та часу, а також спілкуватися через вбудований чат. Окрім цього, були реалізовані й інші функції для зручного взаємодії між сторонами. Попри багатий функціонал, проєкт був згорнутий через відсутність фінансування. Доступне демонстраційне відео, яке демонструє можливості платформи.
YouTube video: Corelist - how it works?
2. Arinfor — багатофункціональний AI-чат, доступний в App Store для iOS (також сумісний з iPadOS та visionOS) та macOS. Додаток об’єднує API провідних AI-провайдерів, зокрема OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Gemini) та Anthropic (Claude). Серед ключових особливостей — можливість додавання власних API-ключів, гнучке налаштування контексту, зміна параметрів моделей та перемикання між ними без втрати історії чату.
App Store: Arinfor
3. Caflact — мобільний застосунок для iOS, створений з метою підвищення ерудиції користувачів. Декілька разів на день він надсилає цікавi факти, згенеровані AI, відповідно до мови інтерфейсу (англійська, українська, російська).

ios,"Over the past 11 years, I’ve been building mobile applications, focusing primarily on iOS, but also leading mixed iOS and Android teams. I’ve worked on complex, high-load products used by thousands of users daily, often from the ground up.
One of the key projects I led was OLL.TV, where I managed a mobile team of 10 engineers (5 iOS + 5 Android). We completely redesigned the app, rebuilt its architecture, implemented a custom video player with DRM support, subscription logic, and analytics integration. I was responsible for both technical leadership and cross-platform synchronization, task estimation, communication with stakeholders, and ensuring release quality.
Currently, I’m working as an iOS Team Lead on a confidential social media app. We’re using SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM+O, and integrating a Kotlin Multiplatform backend. I lead a team of 5 iOS engineers, design architecture, conduct code reviews, mentor teammates, and take ownership of the most complex features — like a custom camera, video editor, video trimmer timeline, and player deeply integrated with PHAsset.
Beyond hands-on development, I teach iOS development offline to beginners and mentor junior engineers — over 10 people have completed my mentoring programs, some of whom are now working at top tech companies.
I’m passionate about combining deep technical expertise with strong leadership. Looking forward, I see myself growing into a Mobile Engineering Manager or Head of Mobile role — where I can scale my experience across mobile teams, define long-term technical strategy, shape processes, and mentor engineers at a broader level.
Team Leadership: Successfully led a team of 10 mobile developers (5 iOS + 5 Android), delivering numerous features, driving large-scale refactoring, and optimizing app performance and architecture.
Quality Boost: Under my leadership, mobile apps saw significant improvements in stability and UX — resulting in a user rating increase from 3.0 to 4.7 in the App Store.
CI/CD Expertise: Proficient in setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, improving development workflow, automation, testing, and release processes.
End-to-End Delivery: Drove several functionally complete apps to production, which are live in the App Store, with ongoing maintenance and updates.
Award-Winning Apps: Led projects that were recognized in competitions for innovation and execution quality.
Domain Diversity: Delivered projects across various industries — including:
OTT platforms (e.g., OLL.TV)
Healthcare apps
Dating & meeting apps (with geochats, geofilters, etc.)
Social platforms with custom video and camera experiences
Process Improvement: Introduced modern architectural patterns (MVVM, MVVM+O), improved team velocity through better planning and code reviews, and fostered a strong engineering culture.

ios,"I’m currently working as an Senior iOS Engineer at Technodom, where I’ve led and contributed to impactful projects aimed at improving user experience and app performance. One of my key achievements includes boosting the app’s rating from 4.0 to 4.5 on the App Store by rolling out regular updates, fixing bugs, and enhancing the UI. I also redesigned the Product Detail Page, which led to a 5% increase in add-to-cart conversions, and improved app stability by increasing the crash-free rate from 95% to 98%.
Before that, at Bank CenterCredit, I worked on Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform (KMM) projects to share codebases across iOS and Android, and used SwiftUI and Combine to build modern, reactive UIs. I developed a currency converter feature that boosted user interaction and improved app load times by 10%. Earlier in my career at Chocofamily, I honed my UI development skills, implementing complex designs using UIKit components like UITableView and UICollectionView.
Technologies I’ve worked with include: Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, SnapKit, KMM, CoreData, Tuist, RxSwift, Firebase, and architectural patterns like MVC, MVVM, MVP, and VIPER.
Currently, I take a proactive role in my team, driving performance optimizations, architectural improvements, and mentoring less experienced developers through code reviews and Agile practices.
I want to continue improving my skills in scalable architecture, CI/CD pipelines, and deepen my expertise in SwiftUI and cross-platform development to build even more robust and efficient apps."

I try to be someone my teammates can count on, and I'm always looking for ways to get better and write cleaner, more maintainable code.
At my current job, I’ve had the chance to work on a bunch of cool projects that helped me grow a lot as a developer. Here are a few of them:
Network & Environmental Scanner:
I built an app that scans for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and EMF signals using Core Bluetooth and Core Motion. I used async/await to handle scanning and data processing at the same time, saved the results with Core Data and UserDefaults, and added subscription analytics with AppsFlyer and RevenueCat.
Location Safety App:
This app focused on real-time Location sharing. I used MapKit, Core Motion, and Combine for live updates, and added Firebase Auth for user login. It also had an SOS alert system with push notifications, group subscription management via RevenueCat, and user acquisition tracking with AppsFlyer.
Coin Recognition App:
I created an app that recognizes coins using the camera and the ChatGPT API. I handled image uploads securely with Firebase Storage and managed user preferences with UserDefaults.
Audio Extractor + Offline Player
This one lets users extract audio from websites and play it offline. I used WebKit and WebViews to load sites and reverse engineered the audio stream. Then I built a simple audio player with AVAudioPlayer and stored everything locally with Core Data.
I worked closely with both the UI and QA teams to bring everything together, often under tight deadlines. Making sure the design looked great and the app ran smoothly was always a top priority - and I think we always did a great job.
Right now, I’m looking for a long-term role where I can grow with the team, work on meaningful projects, and keep learning in a supportive environment. My goal is to become a solid, dependable teammate—someone who’s not just reliable, but also a real pleasure to work with"

ios,"I have 5+ years of experience in iOS and Flutter development across wellbeing, tourism, fintech, and medtech domains.
I have:
- Released 2 iOS apps written from scratch (SwiftUI/UIKit, Combine, SQLite, CoreLocation, GoogleMaps, MapKit, AVFoundation);
- Maintained an old legacy Objective-C project and partially migrated it to Swift using a ""modularization"" approach (UIKit/SwiftUI, SQLite, WidgetKit, SiriKit, MapKit, UserNotifications, CoreLocation);
- Implemented new features and designs for iOS, WatchOS, and cross-platform Flutter apps;
- Worked with embedded devices and BLE.
In all projects I've worked on, I used the functional reactive approach (RxSwift, Combine, RxDart). I find functional programming as a paradigm very interesting.
When I worked on a fintech project, we used UIKit, as SwiftUI was released recently. I created wrappers for UIKit that resembled SwiftUI. This allowed us to create UIKit UI using a declarative approach with RxSwift. I developed and tested the solution, and we implemented it in the project.
When SwiftUI was first released, I began a new project using it. One of the challenges I faced was using UserDefaults without complications. To address this, I created ""AppStorage"" before Apple released their own version. My solution works starting from iOS 13.3, while Apple's version requires iOS 14.
For my upcoming work, I'm interested in a full-time role focusing on a SwiftUI & Combine-based app, ideally using The Composable Architecture or a similar functional method.
From this job, I'm looking for:
- Chances to improve my skills in SwiftUI, Combine, and functional programming;
- A friendly team that supports learning and development;
- Learning about different fields, broadening my understanding of the industry;
- Being part of decisions on app structure and technology selection;
- A balance between demanding tasks and my personal time;

ios,"My passion for programming started in the fifth grade of school, when we started learning the basics of algorithms in computer science classes using Scratch block programming. Later we switched to Pascal, and it was then that I realized that programming was what I wanted to do and what I was really interested in.
At university, I was introduced to low-level Assembler language, which allowed me to understand how a computer works at the machine level. After a while I started to actively learn C++, which became my main programming tool. Thanks to this language, I learned to understand algorithms written in most programming languages (except esoteric ones).
In the process of learning, I realized many projects in different programming languages. These ranged from simple console applications, such as bubble sort and quick sort, to more complex programs on Windows Forms and web applications with databases. One of my accomplishments was creating a custom web application from the To Do Category.
I then decided to try my hand at mobile development and chose native iOS development. I first created simple 1-2 screen projects in Xcode, and later I developed from scratch a contact management application with authoring solutions, fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem.
I am willing to discuss Salary at the start of the job as experience is paramount to me. All of my current skills are based on solving software related problems on my own. I strive to constantly update my own biological firmware, so I am open to new knowledge. It is very important for me to work in a friendly team where there will be friends, not just colleagues."

1) Fitness and meditation. A project for self-development with articles, exercises, videos and audio for meditation. All actions were accompanied by control and analysis of your current and previous results. (iPhone)
2) A social network with the main focus on distributing files. Your music recordings, videos, examples of your work, and so on. Naturally, the application had a chat, but only with the ability to send Text messages and photos.
Some ideas, such as a live search one to one like in Instagram. (The application is available in the App Store) (iPhone/iPad)
3) A system of two related applications - a doctor and a patient. The application provided for medical prescriptions for medications, exercises, the use of third-party Bluetooth devices and analysis of data from them. Audio and video calls were also available in the application. It was possible to create health reports with a large amount of analytical data, graphs, and so on. (iPhone/iPad)
4) Video hosting application. The closest analogue is Netflix. The general structure is a bit simpler, but nevertheless the main functions such as views, likes, comments for all shows and videos were provided. Lists for delayed viewing, trends, new and similar were also available. (The application is available in the App Store) (iPhone/iPad)
5) Fitness, medical education and personal assistant application. In many ways, it became an ideological continuation of projects 1 and 3, taking the best from them. It was written from scratch entirely in Swift.
6) Ukrainian project. It provides users with an online business card
(personal and business) with the ability to share information about
their business, products, articles and other publications. A kind of social network without the ability to communicate directly in the application.
7) A system of several applications related to fortune telling, tarot, numerology, and so on. An application that provides a paid opportunity to communicate with specialists and clients using chats, audio and video calls, as well as delayed offline responses. Has a feedback system.

ios,"Протягом 2-х років мав можливість працювати у Farfalla Company, де виконував обов'язки iOS Developer. Моє завдання полягало у створенні додатка для iOS, який спрощував процес доставки їжі з різних ресторанів.
Над виконанням цієї місії я працював надзвичайно наполегливо, щоб забезпечити користувачам максимальний комфорт та зручність.
Додатково, я успішно пройшов навчання в Yalantis iOS School, де мав можливість розширити свої знання та навички. Під час цього навчального процесу я реалізував проект ""Магічна куля пророцтв"".
У цьому проекті я використовував передові технології та підходи: Swift,верстка UI в коді, патерн MVVM, RXSwift, CoreData, SwiftGen. Весь цей арсенал допоміг мені створити додаток, та успішно завершити навчання на курсі.
Мій додаток взаємодіяв із сервером, отримуючи від нього прогноз та виводячи його на екран. Крім того, прогнози зберігалися у базі даних, що дозволяло користувачам зручно переглядати їх у будь-який час. Навіть у випадку відсутності мережі, додаток виводив на екран випадкове передбачення із бази даних, забезпечуючи безперервний доступ до інформації.
Моє бажання - працювати в дружньому колективі, де кожен член команди - справжній професіонал у своїй справі.

І, безумовно, я мрію створювати цікаві та масштабні проекти, які не лише викликають захоплення, але й мають значний вплив на світ. Ці проекти відкриватимуть нові горизонти та перетворюватимуть ідеї у реальність, спонукаючи мене невпинно рухатися вперед у своєму професійному зростанні."

In my current job, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the company's iOS applications by implementing modularization, which reduced build times and improved app scalability. I integrated advanced features such as Swift Concurrency, significantly improving the app's performance during high-demand operations. One key accomplishment was optimizing secure payment processes within the app, which contributed to faster transaction times and a smoother user experience.
Previously, I successfully led the integration of Android POS terminals (PAX920, PAX920 Pro) with tourism applications, enabling seamless payment systems that worked efficiently with thermal printers. This reduced downtime and significantly improved transaction reliability in high-volume environments. Additionally, I developed a mobile application for both iOS and Android, with advanced architecture using Clean Architecture on Android and MVVM on iOS, ensuring a consistent and high-performing user experience across both platforms.
These accomplishments demonstrate my ability to tackle complex technical challenges while delivering business-driven solutions that scale efficiently.
From my work, I expect an environment that fosters continuous learning and innovation. I want to be involved in projects where I can apply advanced iOS technologies like Swift Concurrency, TCA, and modularization, while also having the opportunity to explore new tools and approaches. Collaboration is important to me, so I value a team-oriented atmosphere where ideas are shared openly, and we work together to solve complex problems. I appreciate clear communication, regular feedback, and Agile practices that ensure organized, iterative progress.
What I don’t want is a stagnant work environment with little room for growth or innovation. Micromanagement and a lack of autonomy would hinder my productivity, so I prefer a culture that trusts developers to take ownership of their tasks and make key decisions. Additionally, I wouldn’t thrive in a setting with poor collaboration or communication barriers, as I believe success comes from teamwork and shared goals."

ios,"Я активно вивчаю Swift і розробку під iOS, працюючи над реальними проєктами, щоб отримати практичний досвід. На даний момент я створив дві програми:
1. Магазин (міні-версія) – це невеликий додаток для онлайн-торгівлі, який дозволяє переглядати товари, додавати їх у кошик і здійснювати покупки. У процесі розробки я працював із UIKit/SwiftUI, реалізовував навігацію між екранами, працював із локальним сховищем даних та налаштовував базову взаємодію користувача.
2. Програма погоди – застосунок, що отримує дані про погоду за допомогою API. Тут я використав мережеві запити (URLSession), JSON-декодування та динамічне оновлення інтерфейсу на основі отриманих даних.
Я продовжую розширювати свої знання, вивчаючи архітектурні патерни (MVC, MVVM), роботу з CoreData, Firebase, а також тестування застосунків. Окрім Swift, зараз готуюсь до співбесіди на розробника TypeScript, що дає мені ширше розуміння програмування та роботи з різними технологіями.
Моя мета – стати професійним iOS-розробником
Вивчаю Swift та iOS-розробку, приділяю навчанню в середньому 3 години на день.
• Розробив дві iOS-програми:
• Міні-магазин – додаток для продажу товарів.
• Додаток погоди – показує поточну погоду в заданому місті.
• Маю досвід у геймдеві.
• Виконую замовлення на розробку.
• Продовжую вдосконалювати навички та вивчати нові технології для створення якісних iOS-додатків.
Очікування від роботи iOS-розробником
Я очікую отримати практичний досвід у професійному середовищі, працюючи над реальними проєктами. Хотілося б працювати в команді, де можна навчатися у досвідчених розробників, отримувати фідбек і вдосконалювати свої навички. Очікую, що зможу використовувати Swift, SwiftUI або UIKit, працювати з API, базами даних (CoreData, Firebase), а також поглиблювати знання про архітектурні патерни (MVC, MVVM). Також розраховую на можливість кар’єрного зростання та роботу над цікавими завданнями, які будуть змушувати постійно розвиватися.
**Неочікування від роботи**
Я не хотів би потрапити в середовище, де відсутній чіткий процес розробки, немає комунікації та підтримки від команди. Не очікую працювати над застарілими технологіями без можливості їх оновлення чи навчання новим підходам. Також не хотілося б займатися лише монотонною роботою без можливості вносити власні ідеї чи вдосконалювати код."

ios,"Hello, I am an iOS and Android Engineer with seven years of experience. I have worked on a range of business and entertainment projects for iOS and Android devices, overseeing end-to-end development lifecycle of many of these apps. In addition, I have managed teams and used my advanced level of English to establish solid communication with clients.

Throughout my development journey, I've worked on a range of features, but I'd like to highlight:
- The company whose app I was working on, Fundomate, issued physical debit cards to its users so they could pay with the loans they had received. I then worked on a feature that allowed users to add this debit card to Apple Wallet from the application. It was a unique feature that I'm proud to have worked on.
- While working on an app for both iOS and Android platforms that allowed users to connect to professionals in heating, plumbing, etc, I implemented features for video and audio calling by using Vonage(OpenTok). I also added StripeSDK as the payment method for the customer. Video and audio calling are complex features to incorporate, so I'm pleased with the work I did on them.
In my next role as an iOS Engineer, I'm looking for a workplace where I can use my skills to work on exciting and innovative projects and to help a company grow. I want to be part of a friendly and supportive team that values collaboration and continuous learning."

I don’t believe in talent — I believe in consistent, hard work. If I focus on something, I give it my full attention and follow through to the end. I aim for results I can be proud of, and I don't leave things half-done.
I keep learning every day. Outside of work, I spend time improving my skills — whether it’s new technologies, courses, or hands-on practice. If there’s a complex task, I stay with it until I figure it out.
For me, it’s not about just getting things done. It’s about doing them right.
My weakness is spoken English. I have limited experience in conversation, so my speaking skills aren't perfect. However, reading English is a strong point for me. I can comfortably read documentation, including Apple’s and third-party libraries' docs, without relying heavily on a translator.

In the Web3 space, I led the development of web3swift, iOS's most popular Web3 infrastructure library with 800+ starts on github. I undertook the massive refactoring of version 3.0.0, integrating modern Swift features like async and generics, while also reducing binary size by splitting modules. My work also involved setting up a CI/CD pipeline to streamline releases and code reviews, ultimately helping the library gain significant traction and securing funding from the Ethereum Foundation.
Furthermore I've participated in Ethereum blockchain fuzzer development for the team internal needs. The whole project was implemented in Rust leveraging tokio and multithreading approach, as SMT solver z3 was chosen for its perfect balance between robustness and stability. Such fuzzer was wrapped with a service that provides rest API for fuzzer interaction.
