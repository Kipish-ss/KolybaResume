Having worked in a variety of markets and niches, I have learnt to quickly grasp the situation and combine short-term solutions with the deep development of strategic directions.
I focus on maximising profits, often working on the cusp of marketing and business development.
Initially, I prefer to work closely with business owners. That way, after a few months, they have the opportunity to free their hands as much as possible, knowing that the strategic direction is in good hands.
'You save me time' is as important as 'we have grown by X times'.
In the long run, it would be optimal for me to team up with at least a medium-sized company that is either already active in Western markets or is planning to move into such.
It is an advantage if the company has considerable ambitions and if it is able to offer growth prospects for the next few years."

marketing,"Hi,
I am Nadiya. Ukrainian. CMO. Entrepreneur.
I'm a marketing executive who can turn chaos and challenges into structured and successful strategies.
I managed processes at global media holdings, IT companies including ones in the crypto/fintech domain, and various startups in the US, Western Europe, Ukraine, and South Africa.
Over the past 10 years, I've worked in almost every part of marketing. But, I'm especially strong at these things:
- Corporate strategy development;
- Marketing processes set-up and automation;
- Market entry strategy development and execution;
- Brand transformation and identity management;
- Employer branding (strategy and implementation);
- Customer-centric approach and user journey enhancement;
- Product-market fit assessment and product launch;
- Lead generation through digital marketing (SEO, SEM, PPC, SMM, email marketing, review platforms, media partnership, PR);
- Analytics (GA4, Hotjar, UserPilot, Ahrefs, Amplitude) and unit economics calculation;
- Global event management and brand presence;
- Team leadership and agency management.
I was also a co-founder of several startups, which gives me a full understanding of the challenges and bottlenecks that companies can face.
For the CPaaS company, I achieved:
1) Marketing processes set-up: implemented an OKR methodology and team management systems (Asana, later Microsoft 365) that increased the team's productivity by 55%.
2) Market expansion: executed market entry strategies to the Western European countries that resulted in 30% revenue growth (while organic market growth didn't exceed 5%).
3) Brand transformation: successfully rebranded the company, improving brand perception by defining mission, vision, value proposition, and positioning. I also led the development of a new corporate identity launch and website from the ground up.
4) Customer-centric approach: enhanced customer journeys, improving CAC and CLV.
5) Product launch: oversaw the launch of three new products, ensuring product-market fit.
6) Lead generation: developed a process delivering over 200 high-quality leads per month through SEO/SEM, PPC campaigns, email marketing, media partnerships, and SMM.
7) Set up end-to-end analytics to calculate unit economics.
8) Global presence: managed participation in 10+ global events, expanding brand reach.
9) Team leadership: hired and led a team of 10+ specialists and agencies, driving motivation and results.
10) Employer Brand improvement: the offer acceptance rate among international candidates increased by 40%, and social engagement among employees grew by 60%.
Other milestones I'm proud of are:
- Founded and led a tech start-up, building all the business processes and product MVP from scratch.
- Developed and implemented a go-to-market strategy for a few tech start-ups that are successfully growing.
In MTG (Viasat), I launched five pay-TV channels in Ukraine; created a product strategy from scratch; developed a successful B2B marketing strategy; built the TV1000 brand to gain a sustainable #1 position in the pay-TV movie channels segment (highest awareness & ratings) through B2C marketing; analyzed new opportunities for revenue growth.
One of my ""personal best"" was Nick Vujicic's event in Ukraine, which gathered 10,000 people in the stadium. I organized it within a three-week deadline and with ZERO marketing budget.
With my data analytics, creative skills, and product development experience, I consider working at product-led growth (PLG) companies. Or those who plan to apply this approach.
My ideal company match is one:
- where trust in employees' abilities is present from the outset (before it's proven otherwise);
- where the business is guided by a clear mission, vision, and strategic goals of the founders;
- where the C-level leadership recognizes the value of Marketing and its impact across all company departments."

marketing,"Although I am relatively new to the marketing field, I have been fortunate to experience various aspects of both traditional and digital marketing.
In my role, I create presentations for the company, prepare marketing reports for distributor firms, and frequently handle business correspondence regarding the provision of promotional materials, photographs, and videos. I also have experience in developing annual marketing plans, including budget allocation.
Additionally, I have been involved in organizing events, including designing booth layouts in collaboration with partners.

‚Äî Under my management there are 7 brands in three markets: Ukraine, USA, Europe (Poland) simultaneously
‚Äî Every quarter for the B2C and B2B segments, I create and implement promo campaigns to attract new customers. I use the 360 marketing approach in my strategy. Depending on the audience segment are used face-to-face marketing engagement (for example prospects, banners, stickers, other printed materials at the touchpoints), outdoor channels (billboards, audio advertisement in mall and supermarkets, advertisement on radio), digital marketing (BTL, PPC, Facebook ADS, Linkedin Ads), market places (for example multitest.ua), partner programs, crowd-marketing through messenger chats, publications in mass media and telegram channels, as well.
‚Äî To increase loyalty and user experience, in the role of Product Owner and Project Manager, I develop all web products, such as landing pages, self-service portals, mobile applications, chatbots, together with an internal team of programmers. Became the first implementer of the Agile approach to product development, which is now used in other holding processes. Fully familiar with development workflow
‚Äî For 7 years, from 2012-2019, I was responsible for Customer Care Call Centre and sales department. The sales plan was always fulfilled from 80% to 100%, thanks to constant analysis and better working out of objections and improving scripts.

Technologies which I use:
Google Ads, Google Analytics (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Earth, My Maps), Google Analytics, Figma, Facebook Ads Manager, LinkedIn Ads, Stripo, MONIKA  (internal CRM system)
‚Äî On average, the ROI of all performance marketing tools is 400-800%
‚Äî As a Product Owner, I developed 5 self-service portals, 2 mobile applications, 1 chatbot (similar to a personal account)
‚Äî Over 100 business processes were transferred from manual management (for example, in Excel) to the internal system MONIKA for increment performance of customer care, sales, and marketing thanks to my ideas, technical requirements, and deep involvement
- I was the first manager in the company who implemented the SCRUM methodology in the development of Web products and process management.

marketing,"- Communicated a SaaS startup‚Äôs value to small businesses through website and portfolio copy;
- Grew user count of cybersecurity apps by creating persuasive ads and intuitive UI texts;
- Polished my article writing skills and became fluent in tech-speaking at software outsourcing companies;
- Learned why SEO matters and how to make Google - and users - happy at a big SEO company.
My biggest pride so far is seeing the user count going up for the apps I worked on (although I do understand that it's not my personal achievement, but our team's). The same goes for every product demo scheduled after the user has read a case study I created.
Also, researching a topic I used to know nothing about to the point of being able to write a quality article on it gets me every time. That's what I love the most about my job, as well as my secret of never getting bored.
Even though I do not exclude outsourcing companies from my job search, my true passion is creative copywriting for product companies.
So, I‚Äôm looking to join a product company where I can build ongoing communication with users, help shape the brand voice, and clearly show the product‚Äôs value. I love keeping content fresh and relatable with pop culture touches, while still staying on-brand and refined.
As for the content types, I'm looking for a role where I could create short-form copy (interfaces, social media posts, ads, emails, pop-ups, landing pages, case studies, etc.) rather than a longread-only position."

marketing,"Project Manager and Creative Producer with 7 years of experience in marketing, product development, communications, and the creative industry.
As a project manager, I worked closely with creative teams ‚Äî designers, copywriters, SMM specialists, business developers, and other stakeholders. My main responsibilities included developing concepts, organizing effective team collaboration, managing timelines, setting tasks, and ensuring high-quality project outcomes.
In my daily work, I actively used tools such as Trello, Miro, Figma, SimilarWeb, Google Analytics, among others, to streamline workflows and support decision-making processes.
I was also deeply involved in both internal and external company communications. This included contributing to strategic planning, writing briefs, coordinating with partners, participating in content creation, and maintaining consistent brand messaging across public channels.
At one point, I had the opportunity to transition into the role of a Product Manager in a crypto project. My responsibilities included product concept development, building user flow logic, establishing team processes, and leading the project from idea to release. This experience allowed me to dive into digital product development, work in high-paced and uncertain environments, and manage cross-functional teams effectively.
A separate and impactful part of my work was leading the company rebranding process ‚Äî from developing a new visual identity and brand assets to redesigning the corporate style and updating all external communication channels. I oversaw the creation of a new company website, launched new social media pages, and coordinated the design, structure, and content with all stakeholders.
Currently, I am looking to further grow in the fields of product management and brand strategy, combining my experience in team leadership, creative thinking, and a systematic approach to project execution. I am especially interested in working with digital products, building strong brands, and developing meaningful communications that resonate with audiences. I am passionate about projects at the intersection of technology, marketing, and design ‚Äî where new ideas are born, user experiences are transformed, and markets evolve."

marketing,"I am an digital marketer (Google Ads, Meta Ads) with 7+ years of experience.
At the moment, I am considering working only remotely (to maintain mobility during the war and an appropriate standard of living, which will not be affected by factors such as rising housing costs in some regions). For my part, I can guarantee a high level of self-organization,  because I have been working remotely for over 10 years, have 3 types of Internet at home, and have been setting tasks that effectively promote businesses online for over 7 years.
Below I will describe the advantages of working with me:
1. I have experience working with a variety of service and e-commerce businesses in 10+ countries (from expensive home-made smokehouses for business in Ukraine to large online stores with an assortment of more than 4 million products in Estonia and Finland, from a pizzeria in a Bulgarian resort town to a chain of hardware cosmetology salons in Israeli cities, from wholesale sugar in sticks to a children's theater school, from a washing machine repair service in Kharkiv to a real estate agency in Spain, etc.)
2. I am able to work effectively in a highly competitive environment (from 20 advertisers in an advertising auction) thanks to the skills and habit of conducting an in-depth analysis of the results of online promotion.
3. I have the status of a Google partner.
4. I have experience in managing a team of Internet specialists and programmers within startup and client projects around the world. I help to select digital specialists for project goals.
5. I am able to clearly set tasks for both technical programmers and digital promotion tasks, as I have been working independently for over 7 years and am responsible for my projects not only for paid traffic, but also for the client's business promotion strategy.
And the most important thing is that I know how to count and spend money wisely.  Here are the numbers:
- for an e-commerce company that was forced to resume operations in Ukraine during the full-scale invasion, I increased marketing spending by 60% and profits grew by 142%;
- for a large e-commerce company from Estonia, I saved 27,000 euros in 3 months by optimizing the costs of just one advertising campaign, which allowed me to start attracting customers in Iceland;
- in 2023, I helped my clients generate more than 500,000 euros in advertising revenue (this is the amount without advertising costs and my work fees)."

Project 2: AI-automated travel expense accounting
Project Summary: Travel expense accounting. I developed automation that simplifies the travel expense accounting process for small businesses. The system allows employees to submit checks, receipts, and audio expense reports via a Telegram bot. Using the OpenAI module in Make.com, the data is automatically processed, structured, and transferred to Google Sheets or CRM.
Result: Automation reduces administrative burden, minimizes expense accounting errors, and speeds up the reporting process for businesses.

Project: Automation of UTM data collection and integration with Pipedrive
Goal:
To provide full tracking of lead sources from Google Ads advertising campaigns to CRM, for accurate conversion analytics and optimization of marketing channels.
What was done:
Added UTM tags to advertising links in Google Ads
Configured saving of UTM tags on the WordPress site via a plugin/script (cookie/session)
Added fields in FormDesigner to read UTM data from the user session
Implemented sending data to Webhook via Make (Integromat)
Configured automatic transfer of UTM tags to Pipedrive, without data loss (when creating a contact or lead)
Results:
The client received a complete picture of traffic sources and channel efficiency directly in CRM
The entire connection ‚Äî from advertising to CRM ‚Äî works automatically and without loss
What drives me most is creating automation systems that actually solve business problems: reducing routine, improving conversions, providing control and transparent analytics.
Ideally, when there is room for initiative and creativity in building automation logic."

marketing,"Brands don‚Äôt struggle because they lack passion. They struggle because they lack strategy ‚Äî and the ability to tell their story in a way that moves people.
46% of a brand‚Äôs sales lift comes from great creative. Meanwhile, story-driven content is 22x more memorable than facts alone (Harvard Business Review). In a world of fast scrolls and short attention spans, this isn‚Äôt just nice to have ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.
Great content is how brands stay remembered. Storytelling builds trust. Strategy gives it direction. And content is where the two meet.
I‚Äôve spent the past 5+ years helping brands do just that.
From developing content series and being involved in 360¬∞ campaigns for chart-topping artists at Mavin Records and Savant, to leading content planning for podcasts and live music sessions as well as storytelling (content rollouts) at Glitch Africa Studios, I‚Äôve worked at the intersection of culture, creativity, and strategy ‚Äî driving real engagement, audience growth, and brand clarity.
For over 7years, I‚Äôve written and developed marketing content for U.S.-based companies like Afro Lazer, 10Web, and a number of B2B startups, handling everything from SEO blogs and newsletters to web copy, landing pages, and podcast scripts. My role often blends content creation with strategy: understanding the voice of the brand, knowing what moves the needle, and translating that into high-performing content across platforms.
At Techbuild, I translated clients‚Äô product features into benefits that converted ‚Äî increasing content engagement by 30% and improving SEO rankings by 60%.
Whether it‚Äôs B2B SaaS or a creative and entertainment brand, the goal is the same: make people feel, make them act, and make them stay.
Some career highlights:
Developed campaign strategy (Project 21), handling the comms and messaging for brand partner(s) in Ayra Starr TYIT21 album campaign featured in Music Ally‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Music Campaigns of the Year ‚Äô24‚Äù
Scaled YouTube growth by 30K+ subscribers during my time at Glitch
Crafted brand and content strategies for US-based startups and African impact-led organizations
Created stakeholder-facing decks, reports, executive-level webinar scripts and presentations for marketing heads
I can do the same for you and/or your brand.

marketing,"For the past 4 years, I managed my own family business in Ukraine ‚Äî a brand specializing in baby sleeping bags (avava.ua). This experience gave me valuable insights into operations management, marketing, production, and e-commerce development. It helped me gain a deeper understanding of business processes. And it also allowed me to efficiently work with large amounts of data and create content and advertising in a creative way.
I have created texts for the Instagram page of my brand Avava, developed marketing strategies and managed communication with customers.
I am fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, with a B2 level of English and conversational Polish, which allows me to communicate comfortably in international teams. I also have experience working with Excel and large data sets (SPSS, SQL).
I take a structured approach to problem-solving and always base my decisions on data. Having a degree in sociology equipped me with the ability to conduct research from scratch: developing methodologies and tools, collecting and analyzing data, and preparing reports with actionable recommendations. This enables me to approach data analysis critically, considering the context and potential limitations of analytical methods."

I create banners, presentations, simple illustrations (both hand-drawn and AI-generated), posters, and other visual materials for brands' internal and external communications. I am also familiar with marketing design and have a background in content marketing.

I also have basic HTML and CSS knowledge and can work with website builders such as Wix.
- Single-handedly led three design projects for the company
- Created designs that helped the company's HR brand achieve top-5 in follower growth on LinkedIn without additional paid promotion"
marketing,"I have over three and a half years of experience in managing IT projects and five years in humanitarian projects.
Throughout my career, I have participated in a wide range of projects, including:
product support, migrations, new product launches, medical projects, game dev, marketing and affiliate projects,
as well as event organization worldwide.
I have successfully managed teams across different time zones and with diverse cultural backgrounds.
I have implemented Scrum and Kanban from scratch, instilling the values of these frameworks within the teams. Additionally, I have built business processes using Confluence and Jira, applying UML and BPMN methodologies.
In my current role, I coordinate and manage projects in marketing and game development, ensuring that goals are met and that team members collaborate effectively. I am committed to continuous improvement and professional growth, always developing my skills.
In the future, I aim to deepen my knowledge of new technologies and project management methodologies. Additionally, I am focused on enhancing my leadership and communication skills to lead teams and projects more effectively.
Here's an achievement example that I can share without violating NDA:
When I joined a team at one company, we faced a lack of clear processes both in team interactions and internally. I developed and implemented business processes, automated routine tasks, which led to a reduction in employee burnout rates (according to HR statistics). This helped relieve specialists from routine tasks and identified opportunities to take on several new projects and launch new products. Additionally, it allowed us to reduce hiring costs by improving automation efficiency.
Expectations:
I am looking for a role that offers opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth. Ideally, this position would involve challenging projects that push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge in project management and technology. I seek a collaborative and dynamic work environment where innovation and creativity are encouraged, and where I can contribute to meaningful projects that have a positive impact.
I value a company culture that prioritizes open communication, teamwork, and mutual respect. I want to work with a team that is passionate, driven, and supportive, where everyone's contributions are recognized and valued. Flexibility and a healthy work-life balance are also important to me, as they enable sustained productivity and job satisfaction.
What I Don't Want:
I do not want to be in a role where there is a lack of clear direction and support. Micromanagement and a rigid, overly hierarchical structure are also undesirable, as they can stifle creativity and innovation. Additionally, I prefer to avoid environments where there is poor communication, lack of collaboration, and insufficient recognition of individual and team achievements."

I launched and scaled tech products with a focus on the US and international market in multiple industries, including B2C eCommerce (auto auction marketplace), B2B SaaS (SEO tools), IT service (custom software development), fintech (payments), logistics solutions (dispatch), mobile apps (dating) and others.
I have hands-on experience in building marketing strategies from scratch, from competitive and ICP research to leading and scaling teams with large budgets. I'm passionate about building systems and making data-driven decisions to optimize campaigns and achieve measurable results.
- Launched the company's website, which generated over 1000 signed contracts and over $1M in revenue in two years thanks to PPC and SEO channels.
- Successfully launched a new marketing channel - affiliate marketing, releasing more than 20 integrations with automotive influencers, with a total revenue of about $100,000 in one year
- Released over 300 how-to articles for marketers that received more than 190,000 organic traffic in the first six months and more than 6,000,000 views in six years.
I'm actively looking for new projects, preferably in a Fractional CMO role, where I can help businesses build marketing as a predictable system, craft and execute the growth strategy, set up every process, goals, and KPIs to track in between.
I usually start from a Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy and dive deeper into the product. I do market and competitive research, craft a unique value proposition, define a target audience and their jobs-to-be-done. This approach helps the business understand its ""Point A to Point B"" roadmap, next steps and growth points.
After this, I'm responsible for executing the strategy and overseeing every process in the marketing team: transforming strategy into daily tasks and measurable action items, hiring people, onboarding vendors and contractors if needed.
The Fractional CMO role is the greatest choice if you do not have a budget to hire an experienced CMO in-house. It enables businesses to get access to my expertise without the risks of a full-time job."

marketing,"At last I worked as a project manager in an advertising agency and before that - as a targeting specialist.As a project manager I worked with targeting customer‚Äôs goals, strategic development of the projects, up-sales and LTV, team management and client support in different digital tools (PPC, E-mail, SEO, Mobile). And I have experience in media planning, management and creating campaigns, budget planning and control, reporting. In addition, I have experience as a speaker in conferences.
My team has over fulfilled the income plan for the paid advertising channel by 12%. We worked at both lines - ASO (app store optimization) and paid traffic.
This was done by the aggregate efforts of the team thanks to both management and professional technical settings. I was a project manager in this project.
I would like to concentrate myself on one direction to focus on its development. If we are talking about the organization of the working process, then for me it is important to have remote work or hybrid ( not so far from my house), time management, work-life balance. Personally, I have a strong wish to be really useful to feel that my work is important."

marketing,"Experienced manager with a demonstrated history of working in local and global companies mainly with B2B sectors for financial, IT and crypto industries. Strong business development professional skilled in Organizational Management, Analytical Skills, International Business, Strategy, Account and Sales Management, PR, and Marketing Strategy.
I managed the marketing of big music events, FMCG companies (market leaders in Ukraine) and of course IT startups and crypto projects. I specialize in digital marketing, creating a brand strategy, and implementing it.
I'm currently working as a CMO for a proptech IT company. I'm leading several SAAS projects, as well as BI solution and CRM solution for residential real estate.
Raised the crypto project to the top 700 of the coinmarketcap rating and tripled its capitalization. Launched campaigns that generated an additional $800 thousand in trading volume.
Before that I relaunched the music concert hall. One month after the launch we reached the ""sold out"" indicator (sales of 2000+ tickets daily). More than 150 sold-out events with the world stars of electronic music during the summer season.
Also, I had a great experience in an IT company. During my time there, I launched more than ten projects in the SaaS and Internet of Things fields. I have been responsible for the entire product launch cycle: from finding a customer value proposition to attracting investment and entering the US, European, and South Korean markets.
And the last thing is FMCG company Fresh.Black. Over these few years, the company has become the market leader in freshly roasted coffee in Ukraine in the b2b and b2c segments.
I am looking for an interesting project in which I can grow. I don't care much about the field, but it's important to have great people working with me."

I adore work tied to creativity and communication! I'm looking for a new job as I want to dive in into Marketing and Brand Management even more!
Long story short, my story started when I took some design courses, so finding common ground with designers would be a piece of cake for me.
Working as an English teacher, I developed my soft skills and promoted my school's brand across such platforms as Tik Tok, Instagram, and Telegram.
I also conducted introductory lessons and webinars and coached other new-coming teachers. That experience proved I might be a good Team leader one day.
I also held the position of content editor/news analyst at UX Magazine where I did a lot of research, managed all the UX magazine content, did a lot of copywriting for the magazine, managed and worked with analytics, tracked our KPIs and helped our author‚Äôs community grow.
Apart from working on the magazine, I helped managed different projects in Onereach.ai company. I've implemented email-marketing and developed a few solutions for the team to automate processes.
I'm also keen on launching new products since I've had a lot of experience in info business on the UA market, know a fair share of how to do a competitor analysis, analyze target audience and create a WOW-product.
I'm great at communication with contractors and hitting the deadlines. I like to find myself in a never-ending competitive space. It helps me and the team grow!
Let's do wonders together!
Helped launch Tik-Tok account for English Prime school in Ukraine. Got my hands on implementing and managing email-marketing at Onereach.ai. Launched an online course together with an expert in the filed of Social Media Marketing. Senior SMM - we created a program that provided our students with the following clients: –î—ñ—è.–±—ñ–∑–Ω–µ—Å, Watsons, Monobank. Our students worked with these brands and created marketing campaigns for them.
I'd love to find a place where I can apply all the knowledge gained throughout the years both related to analytical and creative work. I'd want to take a lead position since I'm known to manage the team well and push things forward. All I want is space for creativity, a flexible schedule since I might have a different timezone and suitable conditions (competitive salary, constant education, team-building activities, etc.)"

What separates me from the others is my focus on revenue and ROI. Instead of less obvious metrics clicks, likes, followers, etc. Businesses must earn first.

marketing,"In my recent role as Co-Lead of the Digital Business Team at Jestone Education (Nigeria & UK), I spearheaded digital transformation initiatives by aligning IT systems with marketing and sales operations. My team and I implemented and optimized digital platforms to support integrated marketing campaigns across multiple locations. We effectively collaborated with influencers, leveraged cloud-based analytics, and continuously refined performance metrics to ensure strategic alignment with the company‚Äôs goals.
Prior to that, as a Digital Business/IT Executive at Jestone Education, I was instrumental in deploying and optimizing CRM systems, integrating digital tools into core business functions, and executing data-driven multi-channel campaigns on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Google Ads. I also trained cross-functional teams on digital best practices and monitored KPIs to evaluate and improve campaign performance.
While leading the eCommerce Onboarding and Support Team at MindtheGap, I managed end-to-end client onboarding, coordinated cross-functional collaboration, and ensured timely technical issue resolution. I also refined support processes and gathered insights to contribute to product development and enhance platform scalability.
Earlier in my career, I interned as a Python Programmer at Foremost Engineering Company, where I worked on SQL queries, web-based database development, integration testing, and cloud-based deployment.
Technologies and tools I‚Äôve worked with include:
1. Digital marketing platforms: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn, YouTube, Spotify Ads, Boomplay Ads
2. CRM systems & marketing automation
3. Google Analytics, A/B Testing
4. Project management frameworks: Agile, Scrum, Waterfall
5. Cloud platforms & SQL-based databases
6. Data visualization & KPI monitoring tools
Current role in the team: In my most recent position, I functioned in a leadership role, co-managing a digital business team across multiple locations. My responsibilities spanned strategic planning, execution oversight, stakeholder management, and team coordination.
What I want to improve: I‚Äôm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science to deepen my technical expertise, particularly in data modeling, predictive analytics, and advanced automation. I‚Äôm also working on enhancing my proficiency in integrating AI-powered solutions into marketing and digital transformation strategies to further drive performance and innovation.
1. Massive Lead Generation Growth: Spearheaded the strategic revamp of lead generation funnels and digital campaigns, resulting in a 4,646% increase in active leads, scaling from 276 active leads per year to over 13,100 within just 5 months.
2. Instagram Community Expansion: Led content strategy, campaign execution, and influencer partnerships that boosted the company‚Äôs Instagram following from 4,000+ to 13,000+ in under 5 months, a 225%+ growth rate.
3. Cross-Platform Social Media Growth: Achieved 150%+ increase in followership across all major social media channels. Notably, grew the company‚Äôs X (formerly Twitter) account from 133 to over 4,000 followers within 5 months through targeted content, hashtag strategy, and engagement campaigns.
4. Marketing Funnel Optimization: Integrated CRM automation and A/B-tested marketing funnels that not only increased inbound leads but also significantly improved lead-to-conversion ratios.
5. Brand Visibility & Reach Expansion: Boosted brand awareness and engagement by optimizing paid media strategies on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Ads, contributing to higher impressions, CTR, and campaign ROI.
I am seeking a work environment that fosters creativity, continuous learning, and strategic impact. I thrive when given the opportunity to lead meaningful digital initiatives, work with cross-functional teams, and drive measurable growth through data-informed strategies. I value transparency, innovation, and a culture that celebrates collaboration and personal development.
I‚Äôm particularly drawn to roles where I can blend my background in digital marketing, tech-driven transformation, and analytics to solve real business challenges and contribute to long-term growth.
On the other hand, I prefer to avoid environments that are resistant to change or innovation, or where digital initiatives are treated as afterthoughts rather than integral to the company‚Äôs mission. I also value clarity of direction and would find it difficult in settings with chronic misalignment or a lack of communication across teams."

marketing,"To begin with, I started to work as an English tutor while studying translation and interpreting at university. I've been working at Englishdom and there I gained communication and sales skills and improved my English. Then I created my own platform as a personal stylist. It was a marvelous experience to work with client's needs and help them to improve their style.  Also, I've been working as a Key Holder in Calzedonia. I was managing the staff, dealing with numbers, and providing high-quality service for the customers. My last job was at the event planning agency Touche. My main responsibilities were to develop and maintain strong relationships with key customers, resulting in increased sales. Now I'm ready to use all my experience in a new field."

I have a talent for creating effective commercial proposals and communications that resonate with customers, and am experienced in product creation planning and organization, as well as product content management. When problems arise, I am skilled in analyzing them and finding practical solutions. Communication with development and devops teams is also a strength of mine.
Finally, I am experienced in developing product promotion strategies and analyzing the competitive environment to create unique selling propositions (UTPs) for projects. My ability to bring together all of these skills has allowed me to achieve significant success in my career to date, and I look forward to bringing these talents to new challenges in the future.

Such courses as Big Data with Hadoop Fundamentals, HTML&CSS and Cybersecurity basics help me to stay up to date in the modern world.
I'm open to opportunities and ready for challenges.
I don't consider translation or content writing roles"
marketing,"My personal career development path for the last 10+ years till now - is about collaborations with very various companies: from the startups & middle businesses based in Ukraine to the big, famous, structured international companies.
I have tried myself in sales & service, marketing, HR& recruiting in individual contributing (senior level) and management roles (also I have more than 5+ years of management experience).
Over and above I worked in different business spheres (education, equipment for events, flowers and wear retail, IT courses & IT outsource for today (about 7 years in IT in total)).
I‚Äôm definitely sure that I can handle any challenge and find effective decisions in any case.
Not only because my backpack has a huge number of patterns or professional background including over 13,000+ meetings, among which 1-on-1, planning, and all-hands meetings at all.
Not only cause I have put 6 teams together, created & developed dozens of corporate documents, was (and is) communicating with the CEO, COO, Project Directors, and other Top Management roles, and tried myself at different leadership positions such as Head of Department (including sales), HRG, COO, PM, HRBP etc.
But also because of that, I find myself as a mature, bold, and open-minded person.
- from the first job (also I worked in 6 companies, GlobalLogic is the seventh) was held just managerial/senior positions/roles;
- forming the teams (6 teams), onboarding, and extending taking into account each project's needs;
- experienced in opening and entering in full operation mode new departments (one of them even in another region (from scratch);
- experienced in staging processes almost from scratch, creating company structures by departments and levels of responsibility for every employee;
- experienced in creating internal documents from scratch: procedures for different departments, job descriptions and job offers, adaptation and onboarding plans, hand-books, phone call check-lists and scripts for sales departments + creative texts for relevant vacancies, welcome messages for brand collaborations, etc;
-  brand communication strategy execution in the media space (Google and social media);
- influenced on the financial growth of the company
About the job/company I'm looking for:
it has to be a position in which I can confidently use my previous experience, realize my creative personality, and necessarily learn new areas, open interesting opportunities that I have not faced before, and meet really great people.
It has to be an honest place, where values are really exist, people are really heard, and work-life balance not just a combination of words.
This is about challenges and improving, people and their cooperation, progress, and its implementation.
And this is quite an important points for me.
I consider myself in a few roles in quite different ways
(pls, see in my CV, why exactly this ways):
- Senior HR BP/ HR BP Lead
- HR Marketing Coordinator or smt. close to that
regarding this point, I even may wrote articles, texts and etc., as I have really strong skills in writing (especially in Ukrainian, but I`m sure that in English it`ll be good too)."

marketing,"Currently, I am seeking to contribute to business growth via effective content and digital marketing strategy, bringing to a table my 7+ years in content marketing roles. They include a Senior Marketing Manager in the fintech niche, overseeing the overall marketing strategy in collaboration with the CEO, managing a team of content writers, a freelance Java/WordPress developer for tech website tasks, and an SEO expert.
Before that, I worked as a Marketing Team Lead at a B2B SaaS. I managed a team of 2 Marketing Managers and freelancers in the following areas: content marketing, SEO, email marketing, Google Ads Facebook retargeting, and targeting.
My responsibility and focus were growing revenue and brand awareness via the following:
-increasing traffic and visibility (corporate website, marketplace listings, events, etc)
-implementing a new content strategy
-improving efficiency and fostering self-improvement among the team members.
I have experience working on a project from scratch, which included managing all the marketing activities:
- creating website copy
- working on content strategy
- creating and publishing blog content
- running email marketing campaigns
- running basic level PPC campaigns
- crowd marketing
- SMM
Besides, I've got 9 years of English copywriting experience - creating landing pages, newsletters, promo texts, blog posts, and white papers covering the following topics:
- ecommerce
- content management systems
- self-productivity
- time-management
- advertising
- sales and customer support
- artificial intelligence
- fintech
After my first year in the current position, I achieved 120% growth in the number of leads acquired through the company's website.
I ran a content audit, which resulted in a 21% organic traffic increase.
I facilitated the introduction of responsibility zones within the Marketing team and achieved stronger focus and motivation of the team members, plus improved performance in their areas.
I successfully handled the process of the redesign of the generator-based landing pages (including content rewriting and optimization)
I am looking for a position where I could grow as a professional, primarily - content marketing.
I would also be willing to engage with email marketing and PR activities, however, my skills in those areas are junior-level.
SMM, Google Ads/Facebook ads are the areas I have little experience in, therefore not the best candidate for positions responsible for these channels."

marketing,"UPDATE:
Please get in touch directly for the latest copy of my CV, since I‚Äôve progressed much from the moment I wrote the following statement.
Please also NOTE that my CV is rather long and very detailed intentionally, aimed to save time for both of us. I do not tolerate questions like - pls tell me about yourself‚Ä¶ Yet, specific questions are more than welcome. Thanks.
Background
My name is Yuriy (Sergeyev) Byron. I am of British - Ukrainian origin and thus bilingual. Please allow me to use this very opportunity to introduce myself, mentioning backgrounds relevant to the prospective project.
At the moment, I am working in the position of Head of Content for a multinational hosting provider. I started cooperating with the company as a copywriter (the company's web resources audit). Still, I quickly progressed to overseeing all the existing and produced content, closely tight to cooperation with the digital marketing team.
Before that, I used to work for a large international company deeply engaged in blockchain and cryptocurrency mining, holding a senior managerial position - Head of Administration/Project Coordinator, but in reality, it was much more like hands-on Project Management, combining hardware and software as well as the physical construction of mining facilities.
Please refer to my CV or address direct questions if you are interested in more details of my previous employments and projects I was actively involved in.
Talking of my educational background, roughly - one bachelor's degree and two master's degrees (Unis of Brighton and Kingston, UK) behind my shoulders, as well as professional qualifications in Fin Tech (Uni of Hong Kong) in 2019 and finally, the most recent ones in 2020 - 2021 at the professional certificates obtained from University of California, Stanford and Yale, courses on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, Capital Markets, Negotiations provided by online educational platforms EdX, and Coursera).
The final touch in my self-education was completing an exciting and highly practical Professional Project Management course by Google.
Thereby, I do see myself in the position of successfully performing the expected scope of work and delivering high-quality results.
PMP by Google is probably the most recent and worth pointing one. Plus, my latest publication at DOU - details in my CV, as no links are not allowed here.
Moreover, being good at teaching and coaching, I believe these are perhaps, more complicated than having to manage people or running businesses. Albeit, I have done a number of promising projects in my life to be proud of.
Other than that, my academic and professional highs do also deserve some medals on my chest... giving me wings behind my shoulders  ))) that is to say, I am a regular big fan of online education, using EdeX, and Coursera platforms.
Otherwise, please refer to my full CV for details.
The only thing I can add at this point is that my stress resistance level is almost God))) Kyiv explains it all.
Should you have any further questions, I am more than happy to provide answers.
I definitely don‚Äôt want to waste your time as well as mine)
Let‚Äôs get things right - I‚Äôve got a well-paid job at the moment but am always open for offers, should those meet my expectations being potentially useful for the offering party. I hope this makes sense. Thanks."

To ensure your marketing efforts are effective, I will focus on key marketing metrics such as conversion rate, customer acquisition cost (CAC), return on investment (ROI), customer lifetime value (CLV), engagement metrics, and net promoter score (NPS). These metrics are essential to understanding the success of your marketing campaigns and making data-driven decisions that will help you achieve your business goals.
It's important to remember that having a budget alone is not enough to succeed in marketing. As a marketer, I will work with you to strategically allocate your budget to ensure that it is used effectively and that your marketing efforts deliver the best possible results for your business.

marketing,"With over 7 years of experience in visual communications, I've contributed to a variety of projects, demonstrating a data-driven design approach and a keen eye for detail. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been improving my skills in leadership and art direction by successfully leading projects and ensuring quality and consistency across all marketing channels.
‚Ä¢ For the past 3 years, I worked with MacPaw, where I was responsible for creating marketing visuals, such as SMM creatives, email layouts, ad banners, landing pages, and in-article blog visuals, for CleanMyMac, the company‚Äôs flagship product, and CleanMy¬ÆPhone.
‚Ä¢ Contributed to around 10 annual marketing campaigns, ensuring design consistency across channels and high-quality video production.
‚Ä¢ Collaborated with content and brand teams to enhance engagement, CTR, conversions, and brand awareness, leveraging data analysis and A/B testing.
‚Ä¢ In my previous role as a Graphic Designer at Genesis, I worked for one year on the company‚Äôs employer branding.
‚Ä¢ For another year, I led all visual communications for Genesis Academy, focusing on creating scalable key visual concepts.
‚Ä¢ During the first two years of my career, I gained experience in graphic and UI/UX design at creative advertising agencies, worked as a part-time marketing designer for product companies, as a full-time designer at a digital agency, and in the printing industry.
MacPaw:
‚Ä¢ I successfully fostered an environment of trust within the design team, as designers frequently approached me for feedback and supported my decisions.
‚Ä¢ Developed the visual identity for CleanMy¬ÆPhone's launch and CleanMyMac's upgrade. In collaboration with the Creative Design Lab, created a cohesive style guide covering most marketing design use cases.
‚Ä¢ Red Dot Award: Brands & Communication Design (CleanMy¬ÆPhone).
‚Ä¢ As art/creative director, I managed the creation of unique photo and video stock, enhancing brand recognition, saving designers' time, and outperforming traditional stock images in ads. 12,000+ raw frames, 600 edited and ready to use.
‚Ä¢ The ad videos for the Vacation campaign, aimed at boosting recognition of CleanMyMac X's Menu, with my art and creative direction, reached 30.3M unique macOS users, garnered 15.5M impressions, and nearly 50% of viewers watched them to the end. Organic reach on SMM channels increased by 105%. The campaign also drove 60% more sessions (ad-driven landings) than the average benchmark and led to a 270% higher download rate from the brand campaign.
‚Ä¢ Designed SMM creatives, optimized templates for consistent posts, and refreshed the visual style for product releases. Here are some result examples:
CleanMyMac's upgrade: +25% followers, +3,700% organic reach, +1,300% ER.
CleanMy¬ÆPhone's launch: 1.9M organic reach.
‚Ä¢ Produced a media kit for PR campaigns to showcase products in top-tier tech and business media, resulting in 200+ media articles and a 22M+ reach.
Genesis:
‚Ä¢ Developed design systems for 30+ events, establishing distinct identities for schools, weeks, cases, hackathons, etc.
‚Ä¢ Crafted the visual identity for StartUp Academy together with Meta, aligning business needs with the visual styles of both companies. Implemented the identity across various marketing materials, including the website and banners.
I value and adhere to:
‚Ä¢ systematic processes,
‚Ä¢ trust within the team and with management,
‚Ä¢ openness and honesty,
‚Ä¢ leadership and partnership instead of subordination management,
‚Ä¢ responsibility for one's actions and decisions,
‚Ä¢ understanding the importance of corrective feedback.

What else can you tell us about yourself?
I am sociable - all my jobs involved working in a team in different positions, so the ability to build relationships with other team members is an advantage.
Stress tolerance is exactly the characteristic that can be attributed to situations when you need to go to work on extra days: Saturday or Sunday :)
I am a fan of my work and always follow the rule: do it well or don't do it at all. I often have to teach people a lot, learn quickly myself and find a way out of various difficult situations.

marketing,"2022 - now
CMO in B2B SaaS (Martech)
### What have I already done?
- I joined the team at the beginning of the war, when there was a 40% drop revenue due to the refusal of the russian audience. Now, we have achieved 20% since this drop.
### What we d—ñd to achieve that?
- We transitioned from Freemium to Freemium + Trial. The main goal was to have a tool that would allow us to sell Self-Service more effectively and make the business more stable through recurring revenue. Sales played a significant role in subscription selling before, but now we are reducing their involvement in selling standard plans. Sales teams will focus only on selling custom solutions for businesses and API.
-- We experimented with CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) and achieved a +30% conversion rate and increased the average check by 35%.
- We have revised the pricing plans to focus on differentiating based on functionality rather than just cost. Additionally, we now communicate directly to determine which plan suits each customer best (previously, we referred to them as ""tariff levels"").
- SEO. We  doubled the growth of English-speaking traffic within a year.

marketing,"I am a highly skilled Web Designer, Content Manager, and SEO Specialist with experience across multiple industries, including iGaming, real estate, and home services. Currently, I work as a Freelance Web Designer at KitchenDEV, where I have designed over five websites using platforms like WordPress, Elementor, and Wix. I specialize in creating mobile-friendly landing pages, optimizing user experience, and improving SEO metrics, such as reducing bounce rates. Additionally, I have experience translating Figma designs into fully functional websites, ensuring they are responsive and easy to navigate across all devices.
Before this, I worked as a Content Writer at Wealth Estate in the UAE, where I crafted high-end property brochures, wrote detailed property listings, and developed content for various marketing channels, such as blogs, social media, and email campaigns. My work primarily targeted ultra-high-end real estate clients, where I successfully emphasized the luxury features and exclusivity of properties. This role allowed me to refine my copywriting skills while understanding the nuances of luxury real estate marketing.
As a Content Manager at PITS Global Data Recovery, I focused on technical content creation and SEO strategy. I wrote in-depth technical blogs, developed high-converting landing pages using Elementor, and significantly boosted daily website traffic‚Äîfrom just 500 visitors to 30K within six months. Additionally, I conducted thorough keyword research and implemented SEO strategies that attracted high-quality leads, while also training the SEO and content teams on best practices.
Earlier in my career, I worked as a Junior SEO Specialist at Webzool, where I gained hands-on experience conducting technical SEO audits for iGaming websites, including casinos.

Throughout my career, I have utilized various tools like Google Analytics, Ahrefs, Semrush, and Screaming Frog to optimize websites and ensure that they perform well on search engines, providing measurable results for my clients.
I am interested in roles as a Web Designer, Content Manager, or SEO Specialist. I often describe myself as a T-shaped Web Designer because I can handle design, development, content creation, and SEO aspects of a project. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity where I can apply my diverse skills and continue growing in these areas. Ideally, I seek a place that offers a fun work environment with strong work ethics, regular working hours, a supportive team, and a benefits package that promotes both professional growth and personal well-being.

I‚Äôve worked across diverse industries, including cleantech, sports and outdoor tech, sustainable fashion, fintech, hospitality, and e-commerce.
Each project has strengthened my expertise in key areas:
- : Audience research and customer journey mapping are essential to understanding the needs, behaviours, and motivations of target audiences. I ensure campaigns align with the right touchpoints across different stages of the customer journey. For example, I developed a campaign for a sustainable fashion brand aiming to achieve a 50% revenue increase and 30% improved customer retention within a year.

marketing,"I've been working in digital advertising since 2015, primarily in advertising agencies. I possess extensive experience in development of brand communications for FMCG, pharmaceuticals, and alcohol categories.
Furthermore, I was promoted to the role of Head of SMM in 2020. At this position I concentrated on projects supervising, team recruitment and training, creating and analyzing operational processes in my team and also in the projects teams.
During my tenure as an SMM manager, I initiated and managed various projects. My experience includes launching and overseeing social media pages from scratch, as well as developing and executing creative special projects. Working collaboratively with a team, we consistently achieved set KPIs and received positive feedback from both users and clients.
In terms of operational and managerial work, I successfully built a department from the ground up, streamlined processes, and trained specialists. The implemented processes significantly improved the final product and team engagement, resulting in faster and more efficient task execution.
A high priority for me is the specific project or product I will be working on. I am interested in working on international markets.
Equally important to me is the team, as I am accustomed to a creative and friendly environment where I enjoy developing. I am always eager to learn something new from colleagues and share my experience with them.
In my job search, I pay great attention to the potential future development of myself as a professional within the company. I want to understand what I will be able to engage in a few years from now if the current position no longer aligns with my career aspirations.
A flexible work schedule is also crucial for me. I am considering either a fully remote setup or a hybrid one. A full-time office format is currently not suitable for me.
I am definitely not considering SMM manager positions that involve content creation. In the last few years, I have been more focused on marketing, managerial, and operational tasks, and I am interested in developing in this direction."

marketing,"Co-owner of an online cosmetics store and creative manager from 2023-2024. During this position, I played a crucial role in defining the brand image and promoting new accounts through various digital marketing channels. I gained valuable experience by creating new social media plans, working with influencers, and overseeing PPC campaigns.
This allowed me to effectively increase brand awareness and build strong connections with our audience. In the project, I handled all marketing tasks, including creating targeted ads in
Google Ads and analyzed the results using Google Analytics. This helped us to constantly improve our
strategies and maximize the return on our investment. I also strengthened our online presence with
email marketing and PPC campaigns, which helped to increase traffic and conversions. During the year of operation, the store gained 1500+ live subscribers, of which 30% became our repeat customers. I also  worked a lot with influencers, and had a small team of employees who were also professionally engaged in targeting, sms, and social media promotion. After we decided to close the store due to the situation in the country, I decided that I would continue to develop in the field of marketing. I have successfully completed a course in digital marketing, where I studied strategy development and advertising creation on various well-known platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Google.
In my future work, I want to be closely involved in marketing, teamwork, communication with clients, colleagues and influencers, and I am passionate about sales, creating something new and promoting existing projects. I would appreciate your consideration of my application and look forward to future cooperation."

marketing,"Hi, I'm Eduard, and as a brand designer of a large chain, I've been creating and improving corporate identity, advertising and print products in collaboration with other departments and taking into account feedback from clients. An iterative design process with continuous improvement is my longstanding reality.
I've done corporate identities in widest sense (from business cards and letterheads to navigation systems, transportation branding and staff uniforms), menus and other designs for restaurants and cafes, unified advertising campaigns taking into account the possibilities of the media - from outdoor advertising of the most unexpected formats and videos for media screens to the design of profiles in social networks and animated banners on the Internet.
In addition, I had regular clients from the show business: I developed festivals, made and improved advertising design of Ukrainian theatrical enterprises, advertising of national concert tours - and given the limited resources (time, budget, technology) got the best result for my clients.
I was engaged in a full range of marketing for the Nemo chain: dolphinariums, hotels, restaurants, fitness clubs, and spas.
The expansion of the chain from 1 dolphinarium to world leadership, a 5-fold increase in hotel rooms, the acquisition of 5* status, and explosive growth in all business areas are evidence of the effectiveness of my design.
I am looking for a new experience: working in the IT environment on projects that improve society and the lives of many people. I'm studying product design right now, but I don't have much experience yet."

Since I started working on developing the blog, our DR has risen by over 30 points. We've also begun ranking higher (top 5 on the SERPs) for the target keywords.
Collaborated with numerous thought leaders.
Have several published thought leadership articles on sendx, sendpulse, etc.
I've filled the blog with helpful content that converts (my articles have the highest scroll rates (90%), clicks and sign-ups).
Ideally, I'd want to work at a company that sells edge-cutting technology. Preferably a (B2B) SaaS company.
No bureaucracy, no 'big brother' to watch the employees."

marketing,"As a driven and hands-on Chief Marketing Officer, I‚Äôve spent years mastering the art of marketing across international industries like production ( clothing, med tech, agro ), IT services, and marketing agencies‚Äîbasically, if it needs promoting, I‚Äôve got it covered. From organizing epic photoshoots for brand collections to developing full-scale content strategies for social media and websites, I‚Äôve seen it all. I‚Äôm no stranger to managing the chaos of production and post-production, coordinating teams, and making sure everything runs smoothly (yes, even when things go sideways).
My secret sauce? A knack for pulling off marketing plans that don‚Äôt just look good on paper but actually work. I‚Äôve led social media strategies for multiple brands, planned and executed campaigns, set KPIs (and crushed them), and optimized everything from Meta and Pinterest ads to Linkedin. I‚Äôve also helped launch B2B and B2C websites, making sure every pixel and paragraph was on point, and added features making sure everything clicks‚Äîliterally, because finding products should be easy, right?
I‚Äôve got some serious email marketing skills too‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs building campaigns that bring in leads or writing catchy newsletters that keep customers engaged. And if organizing international exhibitions wasn‚Äôt enough, I‚Äôve also kept marketing teams running smoothly, motivated people, and made sure budgets stayed in check.
At the end of the day, I‚Äôm all about making marketing magic happen while keeping things real, fun, and most importantly, effective.

What I'm Looking For:
In my current role at a large, progressive international garment manufacturing company, I've found that a significant portion of my work has shifted to routine tasks, which are becoming less connected to modern marketing and management.

marketing,"In my academic and professional journey, I have completed several impactful projects and tasks. For instance, I designed and launched 10+ digital planners and templates using Adobe Illustrator and Canva, which garnered 300+ downloads and positive feedback for their functionality and aesthetic appeal. In the realm of e-commerce, I managed an Etsy store with 20+ product listings, applying SEO strategies to increase product visibility by 10%. Additionally, I executed Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns with a $200 budget, achieving a 5% click-through rate and gaining valuable insights into audience behavior and ad optimization. My role often involves strategic planning, content creation, and data analysis, utilizing tools like Microsoft Excel, Adobe Creative Suite, and social media platforms. Currently, I aim to improve my technical skills in advanced data analytics tools like Python and Tableau to enhance my ability to derive actionable insights and contribute more effectively to team projects.
One of my key accomplishments includes developing and implementing social media campaigns for Alanya Real Estate, which increased audience engagement significantly, with top posts receiving up to 1,500 likes. I also collaborated on a market demand assessment project that led to a 15% expansion in market share among brokers within six months. Another notable achievement is the successful launch of my Etsy store, where I applied SEO strategies to boost product visibility by 10% and ran targeted ad campaigns that achieved a 5% click-through rate. These experiences have honed my skills in data analysis, content marketing, and strategic planning, using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Microsoft Office. Moving forward, I aim to deepen my expertise in data-driven decision-making and explore advanced digital marketing techniques to further enhance my contributions to team success.
I am looking for a role that challenges me to grow both professionally and personally, where I can apply my skills in data analysis, content creation, and strategic planning to make a meaningful impact. I value a collaborative and inclusive work environment that encourages innovation and creativity, allowing me to contribute ideas and take ownership of projects. Opportunities for continuous learning and skill development, such as training in advanced tools or techniques, are also important to me.
I do not want to be in a role that lacks clear direction or opportunities for growth, where my contributions feel undervalued or overlooked. A toxic or overly competitive work environment, where collaboration is discouraged, would not align with my values. I also prefer to avoid roles that are overly rigid or micromanaged, as I thrive in environments that trust employees to take initiative and work autonomously. Lastly, I am not interested in positions that do not offer a healthy work-life balance or fail to recognize the importance of personal well-being alongside professional achievements."

marketing,"Right now, I'm the Senior Email Marketing Specialist at SE Ranking. Think of me as the wizard behind the curtain, managing all sorts of email programs like abandon cart, churn prevention, welcome series, and order confirmations. I've become a pro at developing dynamic email templates, conducting rigorous testing, and diving deep into campaign metrics to make sure we're always hitting the mark. I'm quite communicative and love working with different teams to bring our marketing initiatives to life.
Before my current gig, I was a Marketing Manager at ROZETKA, where I cooked up cross-promotion strategies, managed direct communications, and did some serious database segmentation magic. I also had a blast as an Email Marketing Manager at MEGOGO, coordinating content, running A/B tests, and geeking out over post-campaign analysis.
My toolkit includes a bunch of email marketing platforms like HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, Unisender, Klaviyo, Esputnik, and Stripo. I've even dabbled in basic HTML and CSS, which means I can create emails that look snazzy on any device. Customer segmentation and performance marketing? Yep, I've got that covered too. I love tailoring campaigns that make people go, ""Wow, they really get me.""
I'm a team player, but I prefer working from home office. I love working in a creative atmosphere, and I can't stand a toxic and negative environment. I appreciate my time, which means I'm not really fond of overtiming."

marketing,"10+ years Event Experience
7+ years working in Hospitality
7+ years working in Marketing/Branding/ PR
4+ years working as Senior/Head
I have a versatile background that spans creative direction, operations management, marketing strategy, and brand development. My experience covers both leading my own ventures and holding senior positions in established projects.
Currently, I work with Dominant Promotion as a Creative Partner, where I focus on athlete branding and promotion. I collaborate with footballers, clubs, boxers, and other professionals, developing their personal brands through SMM, content, PR, sponsorships, and strategic partnerships. This role combines my creative thinking with structured execution and long-term brand building.
Previously, I held the role of COO & Head of Brand Experience at Global Luxury Travel (GLT). I led a large-scale international travel exhibition in Vienna, overseeing strategic planning, operations, partnerships, budgeting, and event execution.
In 2024, I founded Personal Growth Books, a Tier-1 market startup offering a personal development tool that combined psychological practices and time management. I managed a team of 150+ specialists and oversaw branding, marketing, and full operational setup.
I also launched Impulse Networking Events, a Kyiv-based initiative during COVID-19, where I managed event planning, legal structure, investor relations, and full-scale coordination.
These projects reflect my ability to work at the intersection of creativity, leadership, and business strategy. I‚Äôm confident in managing teams, scaling ideas, and building meaningful experiences ‚Äî from concept to execution.
Brand Strategy & Identity
Created 10+ brandbooks for companies, individuals, and seasonal campaigns. Helped brands reposition, relaunch, and scale through personal branding, trend-based concepts, and visual storytelling. Currently working in athlete branding and the fashion industry.
International Event Leadership (Global Luxury Travel)
Co-led a high-end travel exhibition in Vienna, managing operations, strategy, budgeting, and partnerships. Delivered 45+ curated B2B meetings in one day, securing long-term collaborations with global travel brands and agencies.
Revenue & Growth Strategy (Boho Yosai / Street Market)
Increased revenue by 30% in under two months via cross-functional partnerships, upselling strategies, and customer flow redesign during a summer brand activation.
Operations & Process Optimization
Led operational restructuring across projects, introducing systems that reduced coordination time by 15‚Äì20%, improved internal communication, and enhanced overall service standards.
Crisis & Adaptive Management (Impulse Events)
Pivoted to offline-safe networking formats during COVID, maintaining audience engagement and monetization while respecting health restrictions.
PR, SMM & Content Strategy
Created multi-channel content strategies for brands, athletes, and events ‚Äî including UGC, celebrity branding, and viral campaigns. Clients and partners include footballers, clubs, hospitality, and lifestyle businesses.
Business Development & Partnerships
Secured strategic collaborations with top-tier hotels, media, influencers, and corporate brands. Developed joint activations and barter campaigns (e.g. Barbie x Street Market, branded photo zones, luxury partnerships).
I have a clear sense of areas I'd prefer not to be primarily involved in. These include copywriting, email marketing, and day-to-day social media management such as posting and curating content on Instagram.
Having progressed in my skills and career, I'm inclined towards taking on broader responsibilities and leading teams. While I can certainly handle these tasks as part of my role, I believe that having dedicated professionals for these aspects would optimize efficiency and allow me to focus on strategic management and leadership."

Skills
Email Marketing & Deliverability ‚Äì Campaign creation, IP/domain warm-up, DNS management (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and Google Postmaster monitoring.
A/B Testing & Performance Analysis ‚Äì Optimizing open rates, CTR, and conversions through data-driven experimentation.

Cross-Channel Marketing ‚Äì Integrating email and social media campaigns for a cohesive marketing approach.
CRM & ESP Tools ‚Äì Working with automation platforms to enhance email outreach and retention strategies.
Strong Analytical & Communication Skills ‚Äì Ability to interpret data, generate insights, and collaborate effectively.
I‚Äôm confident in my ability to optimize email and social media marketing strategies to drive engagement and business growth."
marketing,"In my current role, I‚Äôve worked on a range of projects focused on customer acquisition, digital campaigns, and user engagement strategies. One of the most rewarding projects was at Bento Africa, where I helped refine our marketing approach to drive more sign-ups and improve retention. Instead of just running ads and hoping for conversions, I worked on understanding user concerns, why they hesitated, what made them drop off, and tailored messaging that spoke directly to their needs.
I‚Äôve used tools like Meta Ads, Google Ads, Canva, HeyGen, and analytics platforms like GA4 and Hotjar to track user behavior and optimize campaigns. I also rely on automation tools like Zapier, Make, and CRM platforms to streamline lead nurturing. But beyond tools, the real game-changer has been understanding people and figuring out what makes them trust a product enough to take that next step.
Right now, my role involves not just execution but also strategy. I'm responsible for aligning our growth efforts with business goals, experimenting with acquisition channels, and working closely with different teams to make sure marketing efforts translate into actual business results.
I want to sharpen my ability to scale growth strategies‚Äîfinding repeatable, high-impact tactics that bring in users at a lower cost. I also want to get better at translating data into clearer, more actionable insights that drive decisions faster.
At the end of the day, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to make marketing feel less like marketing, to create experiences that genuinely connect with people and make them want to engage."
marketing,"11+ years of experience in marketing. 8 of them in FMCG/CPG categories with leading brands, where I had an opportunity to impact millions of Ukrainians and sparked social media discussions.
My ambition and curiosity then led me through diverse categories: smartphones/wearable devices, LGBTQ+ dating apps, cybersecurity & SaaS, e-commerce/tactical gear, and daily fantasy sports. I‚Äôve worked across transnational corporations and startups, engaging with the most creative and effective agencies worldwide and touching US and UK markets. I‚Äôve encountered corporate environments and observed how teams are managed ‚Äî both effectively and poorly. But team sports is where I‚Äôve seen the most extreme examples of real and fake leadership. The privilege of war exposed it even more.
Now, I‚Äôm looking to leverage my expertise, professional experience, and interpersonal skills to create well-informed marketing and brand strategies while building and leading the teams behind them.

Looking for:
People who are honest with themselves. People who value honesty, thoughtfulness, and creativity. People who aren‚Äôt chasing power but are driven to make things better. Those who are focused on solving problems, not avoiding them
Companies that prioritize transparency, freedom of thought, and evidence-based approaches while fostering creativity. Organizations with a healthy team culture, balanced work ethic, and authentic leadership focused on growth rather than ego gratification or past grievances.
Not looking for:
I avoid individuals who lack self-honesty and pursue power at any cost. Specifically, I distance myself from people and leaders who display dark triad personality traits (narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy);
Organizations with poor team culture and unhealthy competition causing internal game of thrones. Environments where no one is motivated to sharpen their saws or drive improvements."

marketing,"I am a highly motivated and results-oriented Digital Marketing Manager with 5 years of dedicated experience, primarily focusing on Instagram and Facebook advertising and content management. In addition to my proficiency in these social media platforms, I possess a strong background in Google Ads, Google Tag Manager, and Google Analytics.
Allow me to highlight some of my noteworthy achievements as a digital marketing manager:
Handmade Leather Goods Project (_timeresistance): In this endeavor, our primary objective was to increase engagement and attract subscribers to the Instagram profile. I am proud to report that our efforts consistently yielded remarkable results. Each month, we successfully attracted 1000-1500 new followers, significantly enhancing the project's online presence and reach.
Tattoo Artist and Studio: Working with a tattoo artist and studio, I managed to deliver exceptional results, including a 1000% return on marketing investment (ROI) with a monthly budget of $500. Our cost per lead was an impressive $1.5, contributing to the studio's outstanding financial performance.
Tattoo School: With a modest monthly budget of $200, I helped a tattoo school acquire 3‚Äì4 new clients each month, resulting in an exceptional ROI of 1400%. The cost per lead was competitive at $3.5, demonstrating the efficiency of our marketing strategy.
I take pride in my ability to work independently while consistently meeting budget and deadline requirements. The attached portfolio file provides detailed insights into my past projects, showcasing my competence and accomplishments.
I eagerly anticipate the opportunity for further discussion.
Sincerely,
Tetiana Hranat"
