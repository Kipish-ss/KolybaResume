I've been on a two person team responsible for a service that processes tens to hundreds of thousands of events per hour, with seasonal spikes up to four times normal traffic. Additionally, I've been involved in tangentially related projects, either as a SME or general development assistance. I also frequently handled feedback and questions about that system from other departments, as well as requests for data that required non-trivial queries and data analysis. Skills: Java Spring Boot, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Python, AWS, Kinesis, S3, Microservices, Feature flags, Datadog, Grpc, REST, Graph QL, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Protobuf, SQL, Postgres, Snowflake
Major Projects
● A complete rewrite of the sms attribution system - The attribution service is a component of the Attentive ecosystem responsible for attribution of all SMS messages sent by Attentive client companies to any purchases made by customers of those companies. I was brought on board to assist in maintenance of a legacy Python version of this system and the development of a new Java service, including tests and monitors, to replace that system. We successfully developed and implemented the new system, which continues to operate as a far more stable and maintainable version of that service.
● Maintenance and operation of the attribution system - The attribution service processes hundreds of thousands of purchase events per hour and produces tens of thousands of relevant attribution events. Our team operated, maintained, and monitored both the legacy and modern versions of this system, with special care and preparation given to seasonal traffic spikes that could exceed four times the normal load.
● Architecture and development of new features of the attribution system - Our team was responsible for implementation of new features and functionality within the system, including a major change for which I was primarily responsible, including architecture and development.
● Migration of Postgres queries to Snowflake syntax - I was solely responsible for the migration of a large number of (frequently quite complex) SQL queries, used to produce reports for client companies, to a new Snowflake based report system. This process involved development of Python conversion and testing scripts and to minimize manual conversion and ensure that report results were seamless to companies across the migration. Viasat Inc.
I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects in a wide variety of roles across the entire product stack. The domain of Viasat I worked with focuses on providing airlines with wireless internet services for their passengers. Much of my work here has been focused on implementing and delivering features and change requests for our onboard systems on many major airlines such as Delta, America, Qantas, El Al, and others. If you’ve used the onboard internet provided by Viasat, you’ve probably run my code on your device. I also spent a good deal of time tracking down and fixing hard-to-find bugs throughout the stack. Most recent engagement focused on building a monitoring dashboard solution for our virtualized development labs.
Skills: Python, Typescript, Go, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, AWS, AWS Lambda, Docker, Docker Compose, React, Redux, Node, REST, SQL, MariaDB, Grafana, ELK,, Splunk, Swagger, Selenium Major Projects
● Lab Monitoring Implementation - Our team implemented a monitoring solution in the virtual lab used by both Viasat devs and airline customers. We built/installed internal and external monitors for all components of the virtualized onboard system. We also set up a series of dashboards to display individual system and SLO metrics used by the maintenance and customer care teams to improve reliability and uptime.
● Onboard Portal Development - Here I helped build and implement major new features and customer change requests for on-aircraft portals used to provide internet to airline passengers. One of my major projects was working on the team that implemented the American Airlines Single-Sign-On feature. I was involved in this process from design and implementation to final acceptance testing with the airline.
● Operations Team - As part of the Ops team I deployed new portals and wrote/deployed service rule and pricing database migrations to production systems. As a team, we were additionally responsible for scheduling maintenance windows and prosecuting all required paperwork, permissions, and checks for such deployments, as well as maintaining the unit/component/integration test and build pipeline, providing complete builds of the front and back end components to testing teams, and fixing bugs in all components involved. Improving Enterprises
As a consultant, I worked for a variety of clients over the years, including GameStop, Toys R Us, American Airlines, and many more. These projects often required learning a new framework or language along with an existing codebase. I’ve been responsible for UI construction, database work, business logic implementation, QA, and other tasks. Project size has varied a great deal, from single feature implementation to massive front end and back end refactoring. Team size varied between three and twenty, but all had remote components so coordination and communication were vital. Notable Engagements
● AA.com ~1.3 years - During this time my team and I implemented the new seat selection and Main Cabin Extra features, and an automated Selenium suite used to construct reservations for testing purposes. We also did a good deal of general refactoring work.
● Gamestop ~2 months - A team of three, including myself and a contact at Gamestop built an internal document distribution system that is currently in use at all Gamestop locations. This project was complete on time under an exceptionally tight deadline.
● Zulu Airline Systems ~ 10 months - I participated in building major features for the alpha version of Zulu’s cloud-based airline scheduling system. We also constructed a unit and integration testing suite from the ground up.
● Toys R Us ~1 month - We built a large number of UI elements for use on the Toys R Us and Babies R Us websites. I was brought in towards the end of the project help meet the deadline.
● HCSS ~ 5 months - Two other Improving consultants and I implemented two major features for the the HCSS Android job-site management application. This project was completed ahead of schedule and above expectations.
● Ag Resource Management ~ 13 months - This was my final project at improving. We completed a major repair, refactor of an unfinished inward facing Angular site and its MySQL/C# backend. In addition to my standard development duties, I was responsible for setting up and maintaining the development, test, and production servers on azure, as well as the team’s deployment workflow.

● This started without planning when one of my previous vendors noticed modifications I made to their client code and asked me to rebuild their Javascript based video serving platform. This morphed into creating and maintaining applications for various companies using many technologies such as: creating a pure Ruby library for Bank of America NACHA file creation, YellowBook style marketing platforms with Rails, prototyping a cloud based engine monitoring system for commercial vehicles traveling down the road on a single board computer, created many ETL workflows and more. Most jobs required Ruby and many Rails.
● Some projects only required maintenance or bug fixes and refactoring while others would require full life cycle development. Companies ranged in size from small telecom startups and medium sized marketing companies all the way to international financial companies and the US government. Some with datasets measured in hundreds of thousands, others in the billions.
● Sample of companies: US Naval Academy, Limos.com, CheckByPhoneOnline.com, Fiduciary Solutions, Annuity Alternatives, QuintEvents.com, DerbyExperiences.com, Walton Construction Services, Salazar Waterproofing, Carnival Promotions, Razer Global Marketing, Tingly Chiropractic Centers

Wanting to be hands on, I developed in house systems that allowed our rapid growth by utilizing what became known as Agile methodologies to keep my team lean and mean.
● Moved from many years of Perl programming over to Ruby for systems development very early in the life of the company. Most web work was created in Sinatra and Rails with some Ramaze.
● Used cloud based services ( SaaS ) to enable large company ability while maintaining small company flexibility.
● I created our backend with SOA ( Service Oriented Architecture ) in mind using SOAP / WSDL Rest like APIs
● Most Frontend work was standard hand coded Rails / HTML / CSS / Javascript for internal use with some external facing sites.
