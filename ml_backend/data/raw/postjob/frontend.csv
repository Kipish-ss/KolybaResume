Project Capstone: Sarcasm Detection Using DAG-BERT Model In this project, I developed an advanced sarcasm detection system leveraging the Directed Acyclic Graph Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (DAG-BERT) model. The system is designed to accurately identify sarcastic expressions in textual data, a challenging task due to the nuanced nature of sarcasm. Key Contributions:
● Data Preprocessing: Curated and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of textual inputs, ensuring the inclusion of diverse examples of both sarcastic and non-sarcastic language.
● Model Implementation: Implemented the DAG-BERT architecture, which effectively captures contextual dependencies in text through its directed acyclic graph structure, enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle linguistic cues indicative of sarcasm.
● Training and Optimization: Trained the model on the prepared dataset, employing techniques such as learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping to optimize performance and prevent overﬁtting.
● Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving a notable improvement over baseline models in sarcasm detection tasks. WORK EXPERIENCE

Chart of difference between E-business and Traditional business Points of
differences
E-Business Traditional business
Meaning
It means electronic business. It
also refers to the activities
through the internet.
It refers to the local store which
provides the products and
services to the local customers.
Cost
There is very less cost to start an
electronic business.
Traditional business having a high
cost for start-up and other
activities.
Operating cost
Operating cost is less in e-
business because all the activities
are through online mode.
In traditional business, operating
cost is high.
Physical
examination
In e-business, no physical
examination of goods is required.
This business includes all those
activities which are related to the
local market, so physical
examination is possible in this
case.
Distribution
As an online business, there is no
channel of distribution because all
the transactions are through the
internet.
In this business, various
intermediaries are involved such
as wholesaler, retailer, sale agents
etc.
Risk
High risk is involved in the
electronic business as there is no
personal or direct contact
between the parties.
As all parties are connected and
having personal interaction so
there is very less chance of risk
related to misconduct.
Human
Resources
Technically qualified and IT
professionals are needed to run
an online business.
Semi-skilled and skilled human
resources can run traditional
business smoothly.

Prime Digital Academy June 2017-October 2017
Full Stack Software Development Student
Individual Project: Pirate Storytime, a web application that allows you to store and search for story ideas to tell young children.
• I enjoy making up and telling pirate stories on the spot for my nephew and niece. However, when I’m tired it can be hard to do without prompt. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a site that would give me a few pirate story ideas on which to base my story? Pirate Storytime allows you to store your story ideas and share them with others.
• With Pirate Storytime, users can add their story ideas in five categories of story elements. They can choose to make these public or keep them private. They can also search through the public cards and add them to their favorites. When you’re ready to tell your story, one card of each type is randomly selected from your favorites.
• Technology used: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, Angular Material and Filestack.
• Link on brendtbly.com
Group Project: Belwin Outdoor Science
• Belwin Outdoor Science is a nature conservancy where elementary school students conduct wildlife research. The teachers at Belwin used to distribute data sheets for students to fill out during their research. This makes it difficult to process the class data for the day. They do not save student research because it would be too much work to enter the data from the 10,000 students that visit each year.
• My development team and I built a mobile web app that allows students to enter their data on a mobile device and save it. After collecting research, teachers can easily generate reports that allow them to examine data as a class. Research is automatically saved in the database, so valuable student research is not lost.
• Technology used: PostgreSQL, Express, AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, Angular Material, Passport.
