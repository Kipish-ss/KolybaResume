Dear product team:
Thank you for considering me to join your team. As a multilingual ecommerce veteran, I would be happy to now contribute to your mission to provide safe information and better ecommerce opportunities to all. My skillset could contribute quickly to build a solid content-based ecommerce ecosystem while supporting customers and communities around this vision.
I have a Master (MSc.) in Global Management and Information Technologies from SKEMA
(School of Knowledge Economy and Management) in France and over 12 years of experience in the technology industry with progressive responsibilities and increased scopes at Starbucks, Amazon and most recently at Chewy. Since 2015, as a manager, I have been responsible for building teams to support the launches of strategic products as well as managing the entire lifecycle of several categories. I am adept at starting with understanding users (being internal such as employees or external such as consumers) and creating strategic plans to answer their needs with features while influencing the execution of plans to acquire, retain and engage audiences. Over the years I have developed and continue to invest in growing my competencies by taking part in leading entrepreneurship seminars, workshops, and courses, such as facilitating Startup Weekend
(online and recently onsite) for Youths. I excel at identifying needs, launching, and improving products at a global scale while leading with a strong prioritization framework on deliverables, guaranteeing success. Ones of the most notable accomplishments of my career have been to (1) quickly scale the automated step plan pay system for Amazon HR People Tech to support the compensation of 927k employees during the pandemic, and 2) define the lifecycle segmentation strategy to use machine learning models driving customer experience technology to accelerate the growth of Amazon.ca to 114M MAUs. Specifically, to your search and based on my past experiences, I can provide referrals and examples of successes where I contributed quickly at scaling technology in the USA. My strengths and competitive advantages are in developing teams from the ground up, and defining audiences, goals, priorities and OKRs in line with the long-term vision. As a recognized owner who is seen as customer obsessed and strong in thinking big about opportunities, I am energized to contribute to defining the vision and product roadmap, while contributing to goals by working cross-functionally with multiples stakeholders - both internally and regionally. My interest in joining a new company is much bigger than taking a job thanks to several aspects I like about your mission. To name a few that are important to me: (1) I am inspired by companies who pioneer across the globe and build up communities; (2) a management with a forward-thinking culture to scale will allow me to learn from the business model and to grow while scaling my skillset; - and last but not least - (3) an excellent work culture where I could fit in quickly. I am looking forward to meeting the hiring team to discussing your needs,
Chloé

Welding and fabrication
As a long time commitment to roughneck labor and welding I have compiled a lengthy resume of skills. From ranch work and farming to industrial maintenance I have performed many task in repairs, fabrication, and custom designs. My goal is to continue this path and reshape the idea of how we see welding in a whole.
Work Experience
Hines Furlong
Paducah, KY
Taking a break from my welding career, I ventured out into the river industry with some hopes that I would be able to squeeze into a mechanic/ maintenance position on a tow boat. I moved up the ladder quite quickly. From inexperienced deckhand to experienced my duties involved putting together 15 barge tows. I took orders and executed nicely. Working 6 hour in 6 hour off shift the schedule was something to get used to but it didn’t effect my performance.
McIntosh Welding
Russelville, Ky
I was a lead in a small end welding company that serviced many industrial production needs, from crane building to custom fabrication I was the run too guy. Often I would lead 2-10 men at a time, I would correspond with high up managers, take orders and do installs. In a slow day I spend many days in the fab shop and would construct whatever needed be done. I put many hours in from 40-70 hours a week. I was on call in many cases where I would have to get up in early hours in the morning and asses damages. I enjoyed what I did as I had a broad spectrum of growth and left to my own devices.

End user will enter details such as selecting business format and approvers, who will be involved in different levels of approval, using web forms. There are 40 web forms available in .Net application. Once web forms are submitted, the .Net application will create CSV and PDF files out of it. These files will be stored in SharePoint and a shared folder. User has the provision to upload required additional documents, for different approval processes, in SharePoint.
Knowledge Lake, a batch process, will poll the folder for new documents. When the documents are stored in shared folder, Knowledge Lake will read the document and will create XML payload file. This XML payload will be sent to Teamworks for processing using Message Broker. Message Broker will call a Teamworks web service with payload as an input parameter, this Teamworks web service will call Teamworks Approval Process.

Major Projects (Insurance and Ecommerce)
1. Non-Financial Endorsement Module Sep 2017 – Feb 2019 Endorsements in policy has a usual TAT of 3 days (Non-Financial) to 7 days (Financial). By leveraging the underlying OffServer-Insurance model, coupled with pre-approved guidelines from Insurers, TAT for Non-Financial Endorsements has been reduced to 3 Hours. 2. OffServer-Insurance model Jul 2016 – Dec 2018
Usual Insurance Broker/Web-Aggregator model uses WebServices to communicate with Insurance companies for serving clients. With OffServer Insurance Model, entire journey of customer is managed at Broker/Web-Aggregator’s end.
This includes:
● Premium Calculation
● Rating and Discounts
● Underwriting guidelines
● Proposal Validations
● Payment Collection
● Policy Generation
OffServer Insurance model insures quick, reliable and seamless experience to its customers. It is a continuous endeavour to move all insurers from WebService model to OffServer model. 3. Renewal Pricing Automation Dec 2013 – Mar 2014
For a long time, Renewal Pricing had been a cumbersome manual task, performed using Spreadsheet Applications, which was time consuming and prone to various calculation & other human errors.
Harnessing the Dynamic and Flexible Motor Equations’ systems, Renewal Pricing is now automated. Product based Renewal Pricing can be downloaded from Policy Administration system in Spreadsheet format. Same Renewal Pricing spreadsheets can be used as direct input for Renewal Notice generation. Also, Renewal from portal with option to edit coverages and automated sync was achieved.
4. Motor Rating Equations Aug 2013-Jan-2014
Equation-Based Rating is a rating mechanism wherein various influential factors are used along with traditional Vehicle Age-Location-Model factors. Equation-Based rating contemplates and incorporates Relativity and Severity of these influential factors to derive rating adhering to Targeted Loss Ratio.
Functional requirements catering to such Dynamic and Differential rating required highly flexible and enhanced core systems.
Project comprised of developing Robust yet Flexible Business Rule Engine [Blaze Advisor RMA] and enhancing the Policy Administration and servicing systems [Genisys Configurator and Web Portals]. Page 2 of 2
