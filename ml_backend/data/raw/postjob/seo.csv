LinkedIn Eagle Mountain, Utah
I understand the dental industry very well. Eighteen years ago I was the first employee hired at Intelligent Dental Marketing, funded by a forward thinking dentist with a practice in the same building as our office. We had unlimited access to his dental practice, so I was able to learn how the practice functioned and discover their pain points when it came to making purchasing decisions. With this knowledge I confidently spoke at dental seminars, teaching them why and how they needed to market their dental practice. After the seminar, practices would hire us to be their marketing team.
Then, in 2016 I worked at Henry Schein where I was in charge of marketing Dentrix practice management software to dentists everywhere. Here I learned how so many dental teams fear the technology on which they rely. I also heard teams express their gratitude for the solutions, like Weave, that make their job easier. With all this experience, I believe I would be a valuable AE for Weave. I’d love to discuss this opportunity and look forward to getting started.

D i g i t a l M a r k e t i n g S p e c i a l i s t I am a Digital Marketer specializing in SEO and UX design. While attending DeVry University I gained expertise in UX, HTML, CSS and CMS like WordPress. I've also completed various certifications through Google including Fundamentals of Digital Marketing, Google Analytics, and Google Ads Display and Search. Having hands-on experience with customers, rebuttals, FAQs, and pain points has given me insights on users that normally would require heavy communication with clients' sales departments. By completing the Udacity Digital Marketing Nanodegree program I've become well-versed in SEM, SEO, keyword research, and utilizing Google Analytics for data analysis. My diverse skill set and passion for getting things done are what make me an asset to any team.

seo,"Hello Hiring Manager(s),
I have served as a remote SEO Manager/Director for the past twelve years covering a wide range of clients on over a hundred websites. These included many industry-leading websites. In my last digital marketing agency, I was credited as having the highest client retention rate the CEO had ever seen among over a hundred SEO managers he had managed.
Before serving clients, I worked as the in-house SEO Manager for Motorcycle Superstore and prior to that I was the SEO Copywriting Supervisor at Musician’s Friend.
Types of Websites & Platforms: The client websites that I have managed SEO for covered ecommerce products and services, SaaS, local SEO, FinTech, B2B, D2C, and dozens of B2C clients. A majority of my SEO management has been in ecommerce.
Many of the larger websites I served were built on custom content management systems, others were on Shopify, Magento, WordPress NetSuite, Joomla, Drupal, and Verizon platforms. I have also overseen numerous successful website migrations.
Methods: I’m a natural analyst since I used to chart baseball batting averages across my wall as a kid. I dive deep into technical SEO diagnostics audits; conduct multi-phase keyword research, link profile analyses, conversion analyses, site architecture analyses, and extensive competitor research; manage on-page optimization; revise metadata; and input CMS changes.
Technical SEO: I have proficient technical SEO skills, using Screaming Frog and other site analysis crawlers routinely. I have resolved a broad array of technical SEO issues including indexing and crawling complications, duplicate content chaos, structured data errors, XML Sitemap and robots.txt issues, noindex tags issues, faulty canonicalization setups, and a range of site performance issues. I’m not a developer but have a novice HTML and CSS coding ability.
Content Management: I come from an editing and content development background and have conducted many content audits and content optimizations. I have written and edited a vast array of professional SEO content.
Client Meetings: I have facilitated over a thousand SEO client meetings.
SEO Education: I stay current on SEO trends, news, strategies, and research weekly, and experiment and test SEO tactics. My formal SEO training is outlined on my resume.
Tools & Reporting: I’ve used a huge array of SEO tools and analytics programs outlined on my resume, and provide insightfully summarized monthly SEO reporting. I’m versed in using Google Analytics 4 and advanced Excel functions.
I work hard, with integrity and a cooperative attitude. You can review my experience on my LinkedIn profile at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-riedeman. I hope to meet your team and discuss how I could advance your SEO program.
Thank you,
Michael Riedeman

seo,"Hello,
I am a web professional of
**
years looking for full time hours, and I would like to hear more about this position. Although I worked on SEO 10 years ago, I like to think that the same basis for web page optimization still exists today. I am a very hard worker and due to the fact that I have been web developing for 18 years, I can pick up any new SEO techniques that are required for the job quickly and efficiently.
My SEO Experience
I got my SEO certification in 2005 so that I could learn how to drive traffic to a website that I owned, FreeResumeExamples.net. I was able to drive approximately 100,000 unique visitors to the website due to the keyword research I performed from a program called WordTracker.
I would use these high quality keyword phrases on all of the pages that I built on the website. Every optimized page included approximately 350 words, keyword based meta tags, alt tags in images and hyperlinks, and ingoing and outgoing links from internal and external websites. There was a robots.txt file and with an updated sitemap file. In addition, I submitted my website to all the relevant search engines at that time.
Traffic data was analyzed on the Google Analytics platform. I owned and operated this website for 10 years, and earned money from Google ads as a result of the traffic. I ended the project when I had a family and could no longer spend time on the website.

Learned how to prioritize and implement strategic planning Learned all the important skills needed to succeed, understand fundamentals, concentration and not be
distracted easily
College taught me juggling skills. Especially starting up, I was faced with colossal time shortages. I attended school online and figured out how to pay my bills and rearrange my time to get my school work finished
Learned how to analysis. I have to remain objective in business, take notes, draft policy and procedures and develop them. Since I learned all this at the university, I am more likely to study quickly, to scrutinize mountains of data and understand and apply the essence of what I am doing at the present moment. My failures are more likely to teach me not to do certain things again. I can set up, modify and improve methods to reduce the likelihood of repeating mistakes

Summary
I am very passionate about SEO and digital marketing. I'm constantly looking to learn more. I read a lot and stay current with search engine changes and trends. Since SEO is constantly evolving it is not something you learn just once, you need to constantly learn or else your strategies are not going to continue to work. I love to learn so SEO is a perfect fit for me and I try to stay ahead of the curve by following Google patents related to organic search. SEO is a passion of mine that has not wavered since I fell into the search industry in 2005. I love what I do so much that it doesn't feel like work, just like the old saying goes ""If you enjoy what you do for work you will never work a day in your life."" Work Experience

At RMC I was brought on as a team lead to assist the Online Reputation Management team and also to assist the SEO team. Since I was brought on in a special role I report directly to the owner, Eric Schiffer. One of the most important tasks I do at RMC is working on the SEO on the websites for the many different companies that Eric owns. Freelance SEO, ORM, and Social Media

Continuing to help the TSL team grow the SEO department, which entails staying on top of current SEO strategies and always looking towards the future to see what might be coming down the pipeline in terms of SEO. I spend a lot of time reading Google patents, reading about algorithm changes, and SEO in general. I always follow Google guidelines but I've never been scared to experiment as long as I know that I'm staying within the guidelines. As the TSL SEO director I am constantly sharing my knowledge with the SEO team about new and upcoming changes that will affect overall SEO. This helps us always deliver the best results for our clients so they can easily see the ROI. Since SEO is constantly evolving it is not something you learn just once, you need to constantly learn or else your strategies are not going to continue to work. These are the things that I make sure my team understands, and also things that I discuss with them weekly so we are on the same page and we are all staying current with industry trends.
SEO is a passion of mine that has not wavered in 16 years. I love what I do so much that it don't even feel like work, and as Wayne from Letterkenny says ""If you enjoy what you do for work you will never work a day in your life.""

Managing the SEO department for TSL, a department the company did not have 2 years ago until I created it working with one of my superiors. The SEO department of TSL took off quickly and have been achieving extremely positive results for our clients in the B2B tech industry. In 2019 we began to offer SEO services to clients in many different niches outside of the B2B tech space and have also been seeing great results.
The strategy we use is a combination of what I have learned working in the SEO industry since 2005, and new strategies I developed working on my own sites.

ABOUT ME
I’m an extremely hard-working
individual that doesn’t need supervision
to complete tasks. My previous job was
done 100% remote with little to zero
oversight. I decided to quit because the
majority of my time was spent buying
traditional media.
I have experience building on
WordPress with Elementor. I’ve
integrated with Google Analytics,
Facebook pixel, and uses Yoast to
optimize SEO. My online resume was
built using the Divi Theme. I am
comfortable learning new themes and
plug-ins in WordPress
I take pride in my ability to organize and
complete tasks independently. When
given a job, I can be relied upon to
complete the task within the deadline. I
love solving problems and finding more
elegant solutions to them. Using the
skills I learned at the DU bootcamp, and
the ability to learn new skills using
Google and Stack Overflow, I hope to
build my knowledge of computer code
in a professional setting.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Michael Q. Bullerdick Editor & Brand Builder
“I hired Mike Lello to head up the copy department at 33 Universal’s flagship news site Headlines and Global News (HNGN). Doing so was a no-brainer given his experience, keen eye and professionalism. Beyond those stellar attributes, however, he proved himself to be a strong features writer and continued to impress me in ideation meetings. It wasn’t long after I hired Mike that I gave him the additional title of senior editor and he continued to serve as my trusted lieutenant until the company’s sale in early 2016. In this capacity, he oversaw the newsroom floor, improved content quality, established editorial best practices, trained employees and oversaw the acquisition of exclusives that helped the site grow from a relative unknown to one enjoying a readership that eventually reached just under five million monthly unique readers. And he did this all while turning in stellar interviews and features he reported and wrote. For those reasons – and many more – I will be forever in his debt. I highly recommend Mike Lello, who is best described as a true professional and gentleman’s gentleman.”
Todd Richissin National Editor, Patch
“Mike’s resume can outline his experience but I would add that having worked with him for more than a year that his value goes far beyond mere years in service. Mike’s abilities editing words comes with the tact and interpersonal skills that are a benefit to any organization.
Mike Lello has also been a devoted employee, often jumping on the Patch site at night and early in the morning to post breaking news. He has always been a gentleman, a professional and a colleague with a sense of professional pride.”

Other Interests
Published Christian Fiction Author
I have four novels published through Pelican Book Group in the USA and the latest three independently published on Amazon. I’m currently writing my eighth.
I write in the hopes of giving my readers a deeper understanding of just how much God loves them.
Freelance Article Writing – South African Magazines Over the years as a freelance writer, I wrote regularly for Threads & Crafts, All About Cats, Woman & Home and Soul magazine. I’ve also contributed to Living & Loving, Joy!, You, Shape, and Family Holiday & Leisure.
My other freelance work includes a series of short stories for the OneHope iMatter Project, and a companion guide to the Joyce Meyer book Battlefield Of The Mind For Teens for the S.A. based Joyce Meyer Ministries team.
I’m not doing any of this type of freelance writing at the moment. Qualified Group Fitness Trainer – Aerobics, Pilates & Zumba I currently teach three classes a week. Teaching the classes is a guaranteed way of making sure I don’t skip class myself! Christian Dance Fellowship of South Africa (CDFSA) I served on the National CDFSA committee for many years. We organized and hosted national conferences, workshops, fundraisers and retreats. During this time I also had the privilege of writing, directing and choreographing seven full length Christian productions at our local East London theatres. The bigger shows had casts of over seventy people, representing approximately twelve different East London churches. Personal Profile – Dianne Wilson

Education
Institution: Fashion Design & Management College
Highest Qualification: Diploma
Year
Subjects:
1989
Not a particularly useful qualification for me in hindsight, but I learned Pattern Construction and Grading, Fabric Recognition, Cutting and Sewing Room Organisation, Garment Construction and Fashion Illustration. I’ve been able to sew matric farewell dresses and dance costumes for my three girls.
Institution: Hoërskool Dr. E.G. Jansen
Highest Qualification: Matric with University exemption (called Grade 10 back then.) English is my first language, but I attended an Afrikaans school as it was walking distance from home. I wrote Matric in my second language. I would probably have achieved better results had I attended an English school, but this hasn’t stopped me achieving my goals.

PROFILE Strong writing skills – I have over 10 years of experience writing under a time constraint in a variety of different styles and formats; for publication, product copy and marketing purposes. Advertising Copy, Technical/instructional manuals and marketing writing are strong aspects of my professional experience.
Customer service oriented – Working for several smaller companies has allowed me to communicate more directly with customers, and gain a better understanding of their needs from a marketing perspective, as well as help provide them with writing that conveys material to them in a much easier to understand way. I pride myself on taking highly complex material and rewriting it to make it more accessible to the customer or end user.
Social Media/Marketing savvy – I have a solid understanding of how to market a company using social media as well as traditional marketing methods. I’ve done everything from email campaigns to launching Twitter pages to all forms of inbound marketing.
Easily adaptable – I’ve joined several companies in high-paced industries that I have had little experience with (Nanotechnology, Welding, Cycling, Dentistry, Printing), and quickly became well-versed in writing about every aspect of them.
